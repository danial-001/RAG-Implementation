It is alleged that he sexually assaulted his \\nstepdaughter and touched her body for a sexual purpose contrary to s. 271 and 151 of the \\nCriminal Code of Canada. \\n[2] \\nSpecially, the charges against Mr. R.H. are as follows: \\n1. THAT HE, between the 1st day of January in the year 2019 and the 30th \\nday of September in the year 2020 at the City of Pickering in the Province \\nof Ontario did commit a sexual assault on B.V., contrary to Section 271 of \\nthe Criminal Code of Canada.   \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n2. THAT HE, between the 1st day of January in the year 2019 and the 30th \\nday of September in the year 2020 at the City of Pickering in the Province \\nof Ontario did, with a part of his body, for a sexual purpose, directly or \\nindirectly touch the body of a person under the age of sixteen years, namely \\nB.V., contrary to Section 151 of the Criminal Code of Canada. \\n3. THAT HE, between the 1st day of September in the year 2020 and the 30th \\nday of September in the year 2020 at the City of Pickering in the Province \\nof Ontario did commit a sexual assault on B.V., contrary to Section 271 of \\nthe Criminal Code of Canada.   \\n4. THAT HE, between the 1st day of September in the year 2020 and the 30th \\nday of September in the year 2020 at the City of Pickering in the Province \\nof Ontario did, with a part of his body, for a sexual purpose, directly or \\nindirectly touch the body of a person under the age of sixteen years, namely \\nB.V., contrary to Section 151 of the Criminal Code of Canada. \\n[3] \\nAs is apparent from the charges, they have been divided between two different time \\nperiods. The first is between September 1 and September 30, 2020. This relates to an initial \\ncomplaint by Ms. B.V. which was reported to police on October 17, 2020. \\n[4] \\nThe second set of charges from January 2019 to September 30, 2020 relates to an expanded \\ntimeframe where Ms. B.V. asserted that the sexual abuse had started much earlier than the \\nbeginning of September, 2020 and had been ongoing for about a year and a half prior to \\nher initial report to police. \\n[5] \\nIn October of 2020 when the matter was first reported to police, Ms. B.V. was 12 years old \\nand in grade 6. \\n[6] \\nAt trial, the Crown called the following witnesses: \\n1. B.V. – the complainant \\n2. (V.) R.V. – the complainant’s mother \\n3. J.V. – the brother of R.V. and the uncle of B.V. \\n[7] \\nIn addition, at trial the Crown introduced under s. 17.1 of the Criminal Code, the original \\npolice interview of B.V. on October 17, 2020. \\n[8] \\nAt trial, the defence called the following witnesses: \\n1. The accused – R.H. \\n2. N.P. – a close friend of B.V. at the relevant time \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n[9] \\nThe complainant in this case asserts that she was sexually abused by the accused for a \\nlengthy period of time leading up to her report to police in October 2020. The evidence of \\nthe accused is that none of these events occurred. None of the alleged occurrences were \\nwitnessed and the versions given by the complainant and the accused are irreconcilable. \\nAs a result, the outcome in this case depends largely on the credibility and reliability of the \\nevidence given by the complainant and the accused. \\n[10] \\nThe Crown, of course, has the obligation to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As \\nthe defence has called evidence in this case, the principles set out in R. v. W.(D.), 1991, 63 \\nCCC (3d) 397, apply. Thus, in considering the elements of the offence, I must take into \\naccount that if I accept the evidence of the accused and/or his witnesses with respect to the \\nessential elements of the offence, I must acquit. Second, even if I do not accept the evidence \\nof the accused and/or his witnesses on the essential elements, but I am left in reasonable \\ndoubt, again I must acquit. Third, even if I am not left in doubt by the evidence of the \\naccused and/or his witnesses, I must still ask myself whether on the basis of the evidence \\nwhich I do accept, am I convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt \\nof the accused? \\nThe Evidence of B.V. \\n[11] \\nB.V. was initially brought to the police station by her uncle J.V. on October 17, 2020. She \\ngave a statement to the police on that occasion. In that statement she asserted that the \\naccused had “raped” her on two occasions. The first occasion was in September, 2020. She \\nreported that her mother and sister were sleeping upstairs and her brother was on his Xbox \\nupstairs with his headphones. At around 3:00 a.m. in the morning, she was in the living \\nroom when the accused came and took her cellphone out of her hands. He then put the \\ncellphone on the table, pulled down her pants and then pulled down his own pants. He then \\ninserted his penis into her vagina from behind her as she had her hands down on a table in \\nfront of her. The accused is then reported to have told the complainant to pull up her pants \\nand she went upstairs crying. \\n[12] \\nAccording to the complainant, the second incident occurred not even a week later. She was \\nin the basement of the home. Her stepfather again came downstairs and pulled down her \\npants and again put his penis inside her vagina. The alleged assault again occurred in the \\nearly morning hours at about 3:00 or 3:30 in the morning. \\n[13] \\nIn her evidence at trial, Ms. B.V. stated that she did not tell the police officer on October \\n17, 2020 everything that had happened with her stepfather. She stated that she was afraid \\nat how the family would look at her afterwards. She explained that she gave two more \\nstatements to police. In these statements, she described how her stepfather would sexually \\nabuse her almost every day. This involved intercourse almost every day. It would also \\ninclude oral sex which occurred in his truck. He would routinely ask her to go to Tim \\nHorton’s or the grocery store in the evening. Every time she went with him in his truck he \\nwould demand oral sex. \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n[14] \\nMs. B.V. also described how initially her stepfather put his fingers inside of her vagina. \\nThe first time this occurred was in her mother’s room while they were on the bed watching \\na movie. At some point her younger sister was sent to bed and her mother went downstairs \\nfor a smoke. Mr. R.H. started to touch her vagina over her clothing. Ms. B.V. estimated \\nthat the sexual abuse started when she was 9 or 10 years old. \\n[15] \\nMs. B.V. also described how the intercourse would occur not only at night, but regularly \\nat the lunch hour when she would come home from school. Her stepfather would be alone \\nwith her in the house as he worked on cars at the house during the day for his living. \\n[16] \\nAccording to Ms. B.V., Mr. R.H. told her that if she did what he wanted he would do what \\nshe wanted. This involved taking her to the mall to buy vapes for her as well as getting her \\nhair and nails done at the mall. \\n[17] \\nIn cross-examination, Ms. B.V. agreed that there were times when she was mad or angry \\nat her stepfather and that in around September or October 2020 she wanted Mr. R.H. out \\nof the house. \\n[18] \\nDuring the course of her evidence, Ms. B.V. appeared to be very sincere and was very \\nemotional during the course of her evidence.  \\n[19] \\nThere was some support from R.V., the complainant’s mother, for some of her evidence. \\nR.V. testified that the accused would regularly take B.V. to Tim Horton’s, but could not be \\nexactly sure when these visits took place. She also described how B.V. had developed \\nbehavioural problems starting at around age 10 or 11. \\n[20] \\nR.V. in cross-examination reported that shortly after B.V. had reported the sexual abuse to \\npolice, she sent her to Newfoundland to live with her grandmother. She stated that she \\nfound something in the garage that concerned her and that the decision to send B.V. to \\nNewfoundland was for her safety. She did not provide any details with respect to the nature \\nof the concerns she had at that time. \\n[21] \\nJ.V. reported that on the morning of October 17, 2020, he went to B.V.’s house. He was \\ngoing to take B.V. and his daughter to get an oil change. However, his daughter reported \\nsomething to him which prompted him to take B.V. to the police station because of a \\nreported assault. He described B.V. as having been crying and looking very distraught that \\nmorning.  \\nEvidence of R.H. \\n[22] \\nMr. R.H. is currently age 55 and works as a mechanic and in construction. He described \\nhow he met R.V. and began living with her and her family in an apartment in Scarborough \\nshortly after. R.V. soon became pregnant with Ireland, which was his child. B.V. was his \\nstepdaughter. Eventually the family moved into a house in Pickering. \\n[23] \\nMr. R.H. was adamant that he never touched B.V. in a sexual way. He denied having \\nintercourse, oral sex or touching her in an inappropriate way. Mr. R.H. appeared genuinely \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nupset at the allegations. He maintained that he was trying to be a good father to B.V. and \\nthat the allegations were “sick” and that they never happened.  \\n[24] \\nIn cross-examination, Mr. R.H. acknowledged that he had a long criminal record. The \\nconvictions were for things like break and enter, theft, fail to appear, obstruction of justice, \\nmischief, assault, break and enter with intent, possession of a narcotic, driving while \\ndisqualified, uttering threats and driving over the legal limit for alcohol. \\n[25] \\nMost of Mr. R.H.’s convictions took place on or before September 2012. However, there \\nwere a number of convictions relating to his relationship with R.V. These included a failure \\nto comply with a release order, uttering threats and criminal harassment involving R.V., as \\nwell as a conviction for assault on R.V. from August 2023. \\n[26] \\nMr. R.H. testified that he had a lot of conflict with B.V. He was the main disciplinarian. \\nHe would regularly cut off her internet and take away her laptop as well as her phone. On \\na couple of occasions, B.V. went out all night. On one occasion she stayed at a laundromat \\nwith her cousin in Port Perry.  \\n[27] \\nMr. R.H. agreed that he gave money to B.V. to buy a vape. This was to replace one B.V. \\ntold him she had broken that belonged to a friend. He also agreed that he went to the mall \\nto buy another vape for B.V. This was because B.V. had promised to tell him the name of \\nher mother’s boyfriend. Mr. R.H. also agreed that he would take B.V. to Tim Horton’s or \\na grocery store in his truck if she wanted to go. It is possible this occurred a couple of times \\nper week. \\n[28] \\nMr. R.H. also agreed that he would routinely take B.V. to the mall for shopping, to have \\nher hair done or nails done. He also gave her money for lunch at a local restaurant called \\n“Bubba John’s”. \\nAnalysis \\n[29] \\nThis case is a challenging one. On the one hand, B.V.’s evidence appeared sincere and \\ngenuine. On the other hand, Mr. R.H.’s denial that he touched B.V. in an inappropriate way \\nalso appeared genuine. At the same time it is apparent that the two versions of events are \\nirreconcilable. None of these events were witnessed and there is no forensic or other \\nindependent evidence to support or refute the allegations. \\n[30] \\nWith respect to Mr. R.H.’s evidence, he acknowledged purchasing vapes for B.V. and he \\nalso acknowledged regularly taking her to the mall to buy her gifts. To some extent this \\nsupports the evidence of B.V. that she was taken to the mall as a quid pro quo for providing \\nsex to Mr. R.H. The Crown also points to Mr. R.H.’s long criminal record as a basis to \\nattack his credibility generally.  \\n[31] \\nIt is apparent that this was a dysfunctional family. B.V. did not approach her mother about \\nany concerns she had with Mr. R.H.’s behaviour. The mother appeared to leave all of the \\ndiscipline of B.V. to Mr. R.H. \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n[32] \\nOne area where both B.V. and Mr. R.H. found common ground is that they both testified \\nthey often fought and had serious disagreements. I found it significant that in her evidence \\non cross-examination, B.V. agreed that she wanted R.H. out of the house and there were \\ncertainly times when she was very mad or angry at him. At trial she gave the following \\nevidence: \\nQ. Just a few more seconds, if you will. I just had a couple questions. I just \\nwanted to put you a couple things. Number one, just to end off. My \\nunderstanding is that you really wanted [R.H.] out of the house at a certain \\npoint. You wanted him out of there. Right? \\nA. Sometimes, if he was to make me mad. \\nQ. Closer to the end, you wanted him to leave. You didn't want him to live \\nwith you anymore and your family? Do I have that correctly? \\nA. I wouldn't really say that, no. \\nQ. You wanted to remain living with him? \\nA. There was times where I didn't, of course, with being mad or angry. \\nQ. I'm talking about closer to September 2020, October 2020. You -- at \\nthat point you wanted him to be out of your life? \\nA. Yes. \\nQ. Right? \\nA. Yes. \\n[33] \\nIn Mr. R.H.’s evidence, he described many of the disciplinary actions he took against B.V. \\nThis seemed at odds with the fact that he would be routinely taking her to the mall to buy \\nher gifts or vapes. On the other hand, however, B.V. agreed that she sent her stepfather a \\nFather’s Day card which told him she loved him and that he “frankly deserves a medal for \\nputting up with my shit”. This suggests that there were times when B.V. and her stepfather \\ngot along and that she respected him. \\n[34] \\nThe complainant’s evidence raises an issue as to whether she had a motive to fabricate \\nallegations against the accused as a means of getting him to leave the home. However, if \\nthe accused was harassing the complainant sexually, she would have very good reason to \\nwant the accused out of the home, although this was not mentioned by the complainant in \\nher evidence on this issue. On balance I am not persuaded that I should find that the \\ncomplainant demonstrated a motive to fabricate evidence against the accused. This \\nconclusion is reinforced by the inferences I draw from the Father’s Day card that there \\nwere times when B.V. and her stepfather got along and that she respected him. According \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nto the complainant’s evidence she wanted her stepfather out of the home when she got mad \\nat him from time to time. \\n[35] \\nThere were, however, what I find to be significant discrepancies in B.V.’s evidence. The \\nfirst and most obvious one is that in her original statement to the police, she only mentioned \\ntwo incidents of sexual intercourse which had occurred during the month of September \\n2020. In her later evidence at trial and in subsequent statements to police, she dramatically \\naltered her evidence to suggest that she had suffered longstanding sexual abuse from about \\nage 9 or 10 years old. Her evidence at trial, therefore was dramatically different than her \\ninitial statement to police. Ms. B.V. attempted to explain these discrepancies by suggesting \\nshe was scared and unprepared for the police interview. She stated she didn’t tell the police \\neverything that had happened because she was afraid at how the family would look at her \\nafterwards. At the beginning of the police interview, however, Detective Constable \\nSullivan specifically asked B.V. “do you promise to tell the truth today?”. She answered \\n“yes”. If B.V.’s evidence at trial is true, it is apparent that she was not telling the truth to \\nthe police officer at the time of the initial interview on October 17, 2020. I reject the notion \\nthat Ms. B.V. would not have remembered the earlier episodes of sexual abuse in light of \\nher evidence that she was having sexual intercourse with Mr. R.H. on an almost daily basis \\npreviously.  \\n[36] \\nThe inconsistencies between Ms. B.V.’s evidence in her original statement to police and \\nher evidence at trial include the following: \\n(a) There was no reference to the defendant inserting his fingers into her vagina in \\nher statement to police; \\n(b) There was no reference to oral sex in the original statement to the police; \\n(c) The original statement to police references only two incidents of sexual \\nintercourse, while in her evidence Ms. B.V. states she had experienced sexual \\nintercourse daily since the age of 9 and 10; \\n(d) In her evidence at trial Ms. B.V. spoke of her providing sex in order to obtain \\nbenefits such as vapes and other presents from the mall. \\n[37] \\nWhile I appreciate that a young child like Ms. B.V. may have been genuinely concerned \\nabout how her family might react to her disclosure of sexual abuse, the fact remains that \\nher statement to police was not truthful which must be taken into account in assessing her \\ncredibility. \\n[38] \\nAnother more subtle inconsistency in B.V.’s statement to police concerns her knowledge \\nof ejaculation. At the police interview on October 17, 2020, she was asked the following \\nquestions about ejaculation. \\nDCS: Ok. Do you know if anything happened to his body, like … like as \\na … like when he was doing that? When he pulled out, like do you know \\nwhy he pulled out or .. ? \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nBV: Uh, no. \\nDCS: Ok. Um, do you know what ejaculation means? \\nBV: No. \\nDCS: No? Um … so ejaculation, and … and I know this is uncomfortable, \\num, to talk about. Um, when somebody gets arou --… when a male gets \\naroused and then, um, has an orgasm do you know what an orgasm is? \\nBV: Yes. \\nDCS: Ok. Then, um, ejaculation, its like a … a white substance comes out \\nof his penis ok? Are you able to tell me if that happened? \\nBV: Uh? I wasn’t paying attention. \\n[39] \\nIn her evidence at trial, however, B.V. stated that a couple of times when they had \\nintercourse in her mother’s room, Mr. R.H. would go into the bathroom and ejaculate and \\nthen he would get her to wipe her vagina. \\n[40] \\nI appreciate that Ms. B.V.’s understanding of exactly what was going on (if truthful) may \\nhave changed as she got older. Nevertheless, her articulation of going into the bathroom \\nwith Mr. R.H. and him ejaculating was in my view, a significant inconsistency between \\nher statement to police and her evidence at trial. She stated in her original statement to \\npolice that she wasn’t paying attention and had no recollection of the defendant ejaculating, \\nhaving been given a clear explanation of what this entailed. \\n[41] \\nA more significant inconsistency relates to B.V.’s evidence about a conversation she had \\nwith a good friend at the time, N.P. On cross-examination, B.V. acknowledged that she \\nwas a good friend of hers at the time. She was asked the following question about her \\ndiscussions with N.P.: \\nQ:  Do you recall saying to her that you were going to make something up \\nabout what [R.H.] did to you? \\nA: No. \\nQ:  You don’t recall ever saying that to her? \\nA: No. \\n[42] \\nN.P. gave evidence for the defence. She testified that she was B.V.’s best friend at the time. \\nShe described a discussion she had with B.V. which apparently took place in the summer \\nof 2020. She recalled that the schools were closed and it was warm outside. Both of them \\nwere wearing shorts. As they were walking together, B.V. told her that she didn’t like R.H. \\nand that she was going to claim rape against him. Ms. N.P. said that the thrust of the \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nconversation is that B.V. said that she didn’t like Mr. R.H. and that she was going to try \\nany way she could to get him out of the house. She said specifically that she might claim \\nhe raped her. Ms. N.P. then responded that she didn’t think that was a good idea. The \\nCrown argues that the evidence of Ms. N.P. is not reliable because she could not recall the \\nwords B.V. used and could not recall the details of the conversation before or after. She \\nalso agreed that the words “claim rape” were not used, but that in her view, that is what \\nB.V. was saying. She did not disclose this to anyone at the time, including Mr. R.H., despite \\ntestifying that she would tell Mr. R.H. whenever B.V. was doing “bad things”. \\n[43] \\nAt the outset, it is to be noted that the comments reported by Ms. N.P. about her \\nconversation with B.V. are hearsay and cannot be relied on for the truth of their contents. \\nHowever, B.V. was questioned about this conversation and denied that it had occurred. \\nSection 11 of the Canada Evidence Act provides as follows: \\nWhere a witness, on cross-examination as to a former statement made by \\nhim relative to the subject-matter of the case and inconsistent with his \\npresent testimony, does not distinctly admit that he did make the statement, \\nproof may be given that he did in fact make it, but before that proof can be \\ngiven the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate \\nthe particular occasion, shall be mentioned to the witness, and he shall be \\nasked whether or not he did make the statement. \\n[44] \\nThus, while the statement which is alleged to have been made to Ms. N.P. cannot be relied \\nupon for the truth of its contents, the fact that the statement was made to her can be \\nconsidered as going to the credibility of B.V., who denied at trial making such a statement. \\n[45] \\nContrary to the Crown’s assertion that Ms. N.P. was an unreliable witness, I found her to \\nbe a very credible and reliable witness. Her assertion that she was a close friend of B.V.’s \\nat the relevant time was confirmed by B.V. in her cross-examination. Similarly, her \\nrecollection that Ms. B.V. wanted Mr. R.H. out of the house was at least partially confirmed \\nby Ms. B.V. in her evidence when she stated there were times when she wanted Mr. R.H. \\nout of the house. She was unshaken in her assertion as to what her friend had told her. Her \\ninability to recall the exact words used by B.V. is not surprising given the passage of time \\nand that she had no interest in the outcome of the charges. Her failure to come forward to \\npolice at an earlier time is understandable given her young age at the time these events \\noccurred. \\n[46] \\nI accept Ms. N.P.’s evidence as to what she was told by B.V. in the summer of 2020. While \\nthat evidence cannot be used for the truth of its contents, it creates a serious credibility \\nissue in considering B.V.’s evidence. \\n[47] \\nThe Crown maintains the accused lied when he denied sexually abusing his stepdaughter. \\nIt was suggested that he attempted to minimize any wrong-doing regarding his criminal \\nrecord. For example, when confronted with his conviction for operating a motor vehicle \\nwith over 80 mg of alcohol in his blood, his response was that he was sleeping in the car \\nand wasn’t operating it. When confronted with his convictions for offences against R.V. \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nincluding convictions for fail to comply, assault and criminal harassment (following a \\nguilty plea) he testified that he pleaded guilty so that he could get out of jail. I should note \\nat this point that Mr. R.H.’s explanation about his convictions, while suspicious, don’t \\nnecessarily represent an inconsistency in his evidence because in a number of cases we do \\nnot have evidence about the facts which were found underlying his convictions and which \\nwere raised by Mr. R.H. in his evidence. Having said that, the number of convictions for \\nMr. R.H. involving the V. family is concerning. I am also concerned about the accused’s \\ncriminal record generally. This clearly has an impact on his credibility. It is also significant \\nthat to a large extent the accused’s evidence is difficult to accept in a normal stepfather – \\nstepdaughter relationship. His purchase of two vapes for B.V. represents at a minimum, \\nvery poor judgment on his part and raises a serious question as to why he would have ever \\nagreed to this. His own evidence verified some significant details of the complainant’s \\nevidence as to how the sexual abuse could have occurred (For example, the trips to the mall \\nand Tim Horton’s). It is apparent that the accused did at least have the opportunity to \\ncommit these offences.  \\n[48] \\nYet, even if I reject the evidence of the accused, I must still be satisfied beyond a reasonable \\ndoubt on all of the evidence that the accused is guilty of the offences charged. In this regard \\nthe inconsistencies of the complainant’s evidence as referred to above are very concerning, \\nespecially in a case where the truthfulness of the complainant’s evidence is the only real \\nevidence before me that sexual abuse by the accused occurred. \\n[49] \\nI, of course, accept that as a matter of law, no corroboration is required to support the \\ncharges against the accused. I also accept that the complainant was a young child when the \\nallegations were made and that she was only fifteen when she testified at trial. In R. v. W. \\n(R.), 1992 CanLII 56 (SCC), the Supreme Court noted, \\nIn general, where an adult is testifying as to events which occurred when \\nshe was a child, her credibility should be assessed according to criteria \\napplicable to her as an adult witness. Yet with regard to her evidence \\npertaining to events which occurred in childhood, the presence of \\ninconsistencies, particularly as to peripheral matters such as time and \\nlocation, should be considered in the context of the age of the witness at \\nthe time of the events to which she is testifying. \\n[50] \\nIn the present case the inconsistencies I am concerned with strike at the heart of the \\nallegations against the accused and I have concluded they cannot be ignored. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1920 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n[51] \\nI have concluded that the inconsistencies in the evidence of B.V. do raise a reasonable \\ndoubt as to whether the Crown has established the charges alleged against Mr. R.H. It must \\nbe recognized that the criminal standard of proof is a high bar. While B.V. appeared sincere \\nin recounting her evidence generally, the inconsistencies in her evidence leave me with \\nsignificant concerns about her credibility and the reliability of her evidence. I have further \\nconcluded there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the alleged incidents occurred.

Morgan  \\nCOUNSEL: Alia Nawaz and Haq Nawaz, on their own behalf \\n \\nChris Donovan, for the Defendant, Keith Juriansz \\n \\nJulian Binavince and Shervin Rismani, for the Defendants, Vault Capital Inc. and \\n2439857 Ontario Inc. \\n \\n \\n  \\nHEARD: \\nApril 2, 2024 \\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \\n \\n \\n[1] \\nThe Defendants move under Rule 20 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for an Order \\ndismissing the action. The claim pleads solicitor’s negligence action against the Defendant, Keith \\nJuriansz (“Juriansz”) and, in addition, seeks damages against the Defendants, Vault Capital Inc. \\nand 2439857 Ontario Inc. (together “Vault”), their former mortgagee.  \\n[2] \\nI will mention at the outset that after Defendants’ counsel had completed their submissions \\nand it was the Plaintiffs’ turn to respond, one of the Plaintiffs, Mr. Haq Nawaz, indicated that he \\nneeds an interpreter in order to make his submissions. I asked him why he had not arranged for an \\ninterpreter, to which he responded that he expected Defendants’ counsel to arrange an interpreter \\nfor him. I am not sure why that would be the case.  \\n[3] \\nThe other Plaintiff, Dr. Alia Nawaz, indicated that she is comfortable in English. She then \\nindicated that she would make the Plaintiffs’ submissions for both of them, and proceeded to do \\nso. After a few moments, Mr. Nawaz intervened and continued to explain the Plaintiffs’ position \\nin what sounded to me like perfectly fluent English. He spoke at length, going into considerable \\ndetail about the many conversations that he had with the Defendants leading up to this dispute and \\nafter the matter had seemingly settled. Dr. Nawaz also interjected additional points as Mr. Nawaz’s \\nresponse went along. \\n2024 ONSC 1927 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[4] \\nI also note that the Plaintiffs have both sworn two affidavits filed in this matter. Their \\naffidavits are commissioned by a lawyer (although they are self-represented here, as is their right). \\nTheir affidavits are in English, with no indication that a translator’s services were used or needed. \\nI do note that Mr. Nawaz was cross-examined on his affidavit through an Urdu interpreter. Dr. \\nNawaz was also cross-examined, and although there was an Urdu interpreter present, she stated on \\nthe record that she did not need the interpreter and the cross-examination proceeded in English. \\n[5] \\nI was satisfied that the Plaintiffs understood the proceedings without the need of an \\ninterpreter, and that they were both able to speak and respond comfortably in English. The motion \\nwas scheduled well in advance and all parties were aware of the date and had participated in \\nextensive proceedings in preparation of the record. There was no indication that the Plaintiffs were \\nprepared to retain an interpreter on their own, and there was equally no indication it would be \\nprejudicial to proceed with the motion without an interpreter.  \\n[6] \\nAs indicated at the outset, Vault is a lender who advanced a mortgage loan to the Plaintiffs. \\nThe loan was secured on the Plaintiffs’ home at 4229 Bloor Street West, Toronto. It was for the \\nprincipal amount of $290,000 for a one-year term, with interest at the rate of 13% per annum. \\n[7] \\nThe Plaintiffs’ monthly payments on the mortgage were $3,142.00, payable on the first of \\neach month. In June and July 2016, they defaulted on their payments and thereby triggered Vault’s \\nright to call the loan. Vault brought an action against the Plaintiffs seeking payment of the \\noutstanding principal, interest and costs, as well as possession of the mortgaged property. \\n[8] \\nThe Plaintiffs retained Juriansz to defend the Vault lawsuit. As the Plaintiffs were clearly \\nin default, Juriansz advised them to arrange new financing and to pay the amount required to \\ndischarge the Vault mortgage. Further, because they disputed certain fees and interest that Vault \\nhad charged, Juriansz advised them to pay the amount under protest. This advice was followed. \\nThe Plaintiffs re-financed and paid the amount owing; their protest with respect to disputed charges \\nwas made clear to Vault in writing. \\n[9] \\nJuriansz’s office arranged to discharge the Vault mortgage on September 13, 2016. Vault \\ntook no further steps in the action it had brought against them. The Plaintiffs kept their home and \\nsuffered no loss. \\n[10] \\nThe new mortgagee required a holdback of $5,000 in order to ensure that the Vault \\nlitigation was wrapped up without any further costs. On September 22, 2016, the Plaintiffs \\nexpressed that they were dissatisfied with Juriansz’s services because they were dissatisfied with \\nthe new mortgagee requiring a holdback. They instructed Juriansz to close his file and release their \\nmoney.   \\n[11] \\nOn September 27, 2016, Juriansz released the amount held in trust by his firm and \\nconfirmed that he no longer represented them in relation to the disputed charges. It is clear that by \\nthis date the Plaintiffs were fully aware of any claim they might have had against either Juriansz \\nor Vault. \\n[12] \\nMore than two years later, on October 11, 2018, the Plaintiffs started this action. The action \\nis therefore time barred under the applicable two-year limitation period in section 2 of the \\n2024 ONSC 1927 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nLimitations Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B. The Plaintiffs offer no cogent explanation for \\nhaving waited so long in issuing a claim. For this reason alone, the action must be dismissed.  \\n[13] \\nFurthermore, the Plaintiffs have failed to identify any error, omission, or other basis for \\nclaiming that Juriansz’s conduct fell below the standard of care of a reasonably competent lawyer. \\nIn their affidavits filed in this motion they indicate that they were dissatisfied with Juriansz’s tardy \\nresponses to them, but that does not appear to have caused them economic loss.  \\n[14] \\nThe Plaintiffs also indicate that they expected him to file a defense to the Vault action on \\ntheir behalf, but they do not indicate what the grounds of defense to their two missed mortgage \\npayments might have been. In following Juriansz’s advice to pay the mortgage monies owing and \\nto reserve their rights with respect to any charges or fees with which they disagreed, they took the \\nlegally advisable approach to the matter. \\n[15] \\nAs indicated, Vault never took any action in relation the lawsuit in which Juriansz had been \\nhired to represent the Plaintiffs. As a consequence, although the Plaintiffs may have suffered \\nadverse financial consequences as a result of having to re-finance the property, have not \\nexperienced any damages or suffered any prejudice as a result of Juriansz’s representation of them. \\n[16] \\nThe Plaintiffs’ claim also seeks some $500,000 in damages against Vault, although their \\npleading nowhere explains with any clarity what those damages are meant to compensate. The fees \\nand charges that the Plaintiffs disputed were for considerably lesser amounts. The Plaintiffs have \\nput forward no evidence that any charges or fees were improperly charged to them. At the hearing \\nthey seemed to be more focused on whether the two months of default were really in default. \\nApparently, their cheques were returned marked NSF, but they were of the view that they did have \\nsufficient funds in their account.  \\n[17] \\nMr. Nawaz is of the view that Juriansz’s advice to pay the amounts owing caused them to \\nincur a higher interest rate on the new mortgage that they were able to arrange. As Juriansz’s \\ncounsel explains it, the higher interest rate on the new mortgage was imposed by the new \\nmortgagee, a lender that is unrelated to the Defendants. The higher interest rate appears to have \\nbeen due to the fact that the Plaintiffs had defaulted on the Vault mortgage.  \\n[18] \\nThe new mortgagee apparently assessed the Plaintiffs as being an increased risk, having \\nalready defaulted on an earlier mortgage. Consequently, the new lender charged a somewhat higher \\ninterest rate. Although that is an economic hardship that the Plaintiffs have had to endure, it cannot \\nbe blamed on the Defendants; it is an economic reality and a consequence of their current situation \\nand the new lender’s risk assessment.  \\n[19] \\nThe Plaintiffs contend that this series of events has caused them great financial hardship \\nthat continues until today. In their affidavit material and in their oral submissions at the hearing, \\nthey indicated that they had lost $80,000 in having to arrange for the new mortgage. They also \\nindicated that they had at one time had plans to develop the property commercially, and that re-\\nfinancing at a higher rate and eventually selling the property in order to out from under that new \\nmortgage burden had caused them to lose in the range of $500,000. They fault both sets of \\nDefendants for these consequential losses.   \\n2024 ONSC 1927 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[20] \\nIn addition to all of this, Mr. Nawas indicates in his affidavit that he has suffered health \\nissues as a result of the pressure all of these events have put him under. \\n[21] \\nI have great sympathy for situation that the Plaintiffs have found themselves in. But, as \\nindicated, I see no negligence in Juriansz’s representation of them. The alleged negligence of \\nJuriansz is of a non-technical nature, and there is no need for his counsel to produce expert \\nevidence showing that he did not fall below a reasonable standard of care for a lawyer in these \\ncircumstances: Gunraj v. Cyr, 2012 ONSC 1609, at para. 65. The evidence shows that the advice \\nhe gave the Plaintiffs was logical and sound. There is nothing in the record to suggest otherwise.  \\n[22] \\nAs for Vault, there is no real cause of action against it. The Plaintiffs are upset that they \\nhad to re-finance at a rate they could ill afford and that they may have lost some potential profit \\nfrom the property. But nothing in the record suggests that the fault for that lies with Vault (or, for \\nthat matter, with Juriansz). The Plaintiffs’ default on the Vault mortgage which prompted the chain \\nof events is well established in the record, with nothing to contradict or counter it.  \\n[23] \\nThe Plaintiffs have a lengthy explanation for their current economic situation, but none of \\nit supports a legal claim against the Defendants. There is no issue requiring a trial against either \\nset of Defendants: Hryniak v. Mauldin, [2014] 1 SCR 87. \\n[24] \\nThe action is dismissed. \\n[25] \\nBoth sets of Defendants seek costs. Juriansz’s counsel request partial indemnity costs, \\nincluding disbursements and HST, in the amount of $29,757.61. Vault’s counsel request partial \\nindemnity costs, also including disbursements and HST, in the amount of $18,174.70.  \\n[26] \\nThe Plaintiffs have not made any costs submissions. I would like to hear from them in \\nrespect of costs before making any determination in that regard. I would ask the Plaintiffs to send \\nmy assistant, by email and with a copy to Juriansz’s lawyers and Vault’s lawyers, their written \\nposition on costs within two weeks of today. This written submission is to be no longer than 3 \\npages.   \\n \\n \\nDate: April 3, 2024  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  Morgan J. \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1927 (CanLII)\\n',\n",

The plaintiff, Galaxy Communities Inc. (“Galaxy”), sold the \\nproperty to Mr. Chelliah and was contracted to build the Owners’ house.  The Owners’ family was \\nto reside there, including the Owners, their three children, and Mr. Chelliah’s parents.  The Owners \\nwanted to upgrade into a larger house, since their family was living in a bungalow. \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[2] \\nThe property was initially purchased and held in the name of Mr. Chelliah alone.  Title was \\nlater transferred into the names of both of the Owners.  At the time of that title transfer, the Owners \\nre-financed the property with Duca Financial Services Credit Union Ltd. (“Duca”). \\n[3] \\nGalaxy and Mr. Chelliah signed a construction contract in June 2017, which was prepared \\nby Galaxy.  Construction commenced in 2017 and continued into late 2018.  The Owners’ dealings \\nin the course of construction were primarily with Galaxy’s principal, Mayuran Maheshwaran, and \\nGalaxy’s project manager, “Rushak”.  Galaxy and the Owners ended up in a dispute over Galaxy’s \\nwork.  Galaxy ultimately preserved and perfected a lien for $112,632.15, claiming against the \\nOwners for unpaid services and materials and claiming priority over Duca’s mortgage in \\naccordance with the priority provisions of the Construction Act, RSO 1990, c C.30.  The Owners \\ndisputed Galaxy’s claim on the basis of alleged delays, unapproved design changes, deficiencies, \\nand incomplete work.  \\n[4] \\nIn the period leading up to trial, Galaxy breached various court orders, most notably failing \\nto serve any of the ordered trial affidavits supporting its claim.  Galaxy further failed to appear for \\ntrial.  It withdrew its lien on the morning that trial commenced by registering an application to \\ndelete construction lien.  The Owners and Duca jointly moved at the outset of trial for non-suit \\nagainst Galaxy.  I granted the motion.  Accordingly, only the undefended trial of the counterclaim \\nproceeded.  \\n[5] \\nAs pleaded, the counterclaim is advanced by both Owners.  At trial, though, it was only \\npursued by Mr. Chelliah as the contracting party.  At the conclusion of trial, I was satisfied from \\nthe evidence that Galaxy had breached the construction contract by delayed and deficient \\nperformance of its work.  I was also satisfied that Mr. Chelliah had proven most of his damages, \\nbut I was not convinced that the evidence tendered fully supported the total quantum claimed.  \\nI confirmed that I would be granting judgment on the counterclaim in an amount to be quantified \\nand for reasons to follow.  I needed additional time to review and consider the evidence on \\ndamages, which included expert evidence.  Regrettably, my analysis took much longer to complete \\nthan I had anticipated.  In addition, this decision has been unfortunately further delayed through \\nno fault of the Owners due to unforeseen and unexpected circumstances significantly impacting \\nmy schedule. \\n[6] \\nFor the reasons outlined below, I find that Mr. Chelliah has proven damages of \\n$288,577.10, including HST, and is entitled to judgment against Galaxy for the same amount, plus \\npre-judgment interest pursuant to the Courts of Justice Act, RSO 1990, c C.43.  I further fix costs \\nof the action and counterclaim payable by Galaxy to the Owners in the amount of $45,282.27, \\nincluding HST and disbursements.  \\nII. \\nISSUES \\n[7] \\nIn the counterclaim, there are four main issues to be decided, as follows: \\n(a) \\nIs the alleged deficient and incomplete work within the scope of work that Galaxy \\nwas contractually required to perform?  \\n(b) \\nIf so, was Galaxy’s work deficient or incomplete as alleged? \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n(c) \\nDid Galaxy breach the contract by reason of deficient work and delayed \\nperformance? \\n(d) \\nHas Mr. Chelliah proven his claimed losses and damages? \\nIII. \\nANALYSIS \\n[8] \\nMr. Chelliah’s position is that Galaxy breached the contract by reason of ongoing deficient \\nworkmanship and by delayed performance.  Those breaches have resulted in losses and  damages \\nthat Mr. Chelliah asserts ought to be recoverable from Galaxy.  \\n[9] \\nAlthough Galaxy did not appear to defend against Mr. Chelliah’s counterclaim at trial, \\nMr. Chelliah still has the evidentiary burden of proving Galaxy’s breach of contract and Galaxy’s \\nliability for the  damages alleged to flow from that breach.  To meet that onus, Mr. Chelliah relies \\non his own evidence as well as the evidence of three other witnesses:  his spouse, Sobitha \\nArunakirinathan; Mukunthan Kanagasabai (Ms. Arunakirinathan’s brother); and a deficiency \\nexpert, Jeff Clarke, who conducted a site inspection.  \\na. \\nIs alleged deficient and incomplete work within Galaxy’s scope of work?  \\n[10] \\nThe construction contract, which was drafted by Galaxy, expressly requires that the house \\nbe built per the specifications and approved drawings attached to the contract.  Mr. Chelliah’s \\ncounterclaim is based on those drawings, which were prepared in January 2015.  \\n[11] \\nMr. Chelliah acknowledges that Galaxy submitted revised plans and drawings to the City \\nof Toronto, which were prepared in August 2017.  However, his affidavit evidence is that neither \\nhe nor his spouse, Ms. Arunakirinathan, had ever seen those revised plans prior to discovery in \\nthis action and that they had no knowledge that Galaxy had submitted them.  \\nMs. Arunakirinathan’s affidavit agrees with Mr. Chelliah’s evidence.  I accept that uncontested \\nevidence.  I accordingly find that the drawings prepared in January 2015, as attached to the contract \\nand initialled by the parties, govern for considering Galaxy’s scope of work and in deciding \\nwhether Galaxy’s work was deficient or incomplete.  Those are the drawings to which I refer in \\nthe balance of this decision. \\n[12] \\nMr. Chelliah claims damages from a total of twenty-four work items that are said to be \\neither deficiently performed or incomplete.  In his affidavit evidence-in-chief, Mr. Chelliah gives \\nspecific evidence on a number of deficiencies and incomplete work, but also adopts the Scott \\nSchedule.  He states that the Scott Schedule “accurately reflects the remaining problems my wife \\nand I have found with the house.”   \\n[13] \\nThe Scott Schedule sets out the particulars of alleged deficiencies in Galaxy’s work and \\nnon-compliance with the agreed plans and approved construction drawings.  It is the basis of \\nMr. Chelliah’s damages claim.  I have re-grouped the items for ease of dealing with them.  They \\nare as follows: \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n(a) \\nWindows: \\n(i) \\nwindows have been installed at differing and misaligned heights contrary to \\nthe contract drawings; \\n(ii) \\na front ground floor window and a front second floor window were not \\ninstalled as depicted in the contract drawings, resulting in an asymmetrical \\nappearance; \\n(iii) \\ntwo side windows on the first and second storeys (toward the front of the \\nhouse) were not installed as depicted in the contract drawings; \\n(iv) \\na basement window was not installed as depicted in the contract drawings; \\n(v) \\nthree round decorative windows above the garage were not installed as \\ndepicted in the contract drawings; \\n(vi) \\nthe living room window has not been installed with a pre-cast lintel above \\nit, contrary to the contract drawings; and \\n(vii) \\nthe supplied and installed windows are of inferior quality. \\n(b) \\nUnapproved design changes: \\n(i) \\na main floor laundry room was not built as depicted in the contract \\ndrawings, with the laundry machines instead being installed in the \\nbasement; \\n(ii) \\nthe furnace was installed in a different location than depicted in the contract \\ndrawings; \\n(iii) \\ntwo closets that were not depicted in the contract drawings were constructed \\non the second floor landing, which was supposed to be an open area with a \\nwindow; \\n(iv) \\nthe main floor family room fireplace was relocated from the north wall to \\nthe east wall, compromising the original concept of the family room, which \\nwas to include a large family room window; \\n(v) \\nthe height in the attic and the height of the roof elevation was changed, with \\nroof construction being much lower than what is depicted in the contract \\ndrawings. \\n(c) \\nPoor quality workmanship: \\n(i) \\ninstallation and finishing throughout the master bathroom was poor quality, \\nincluding water leaks from the shower door/lintel; \\n(ii) \\nthe light above the garage entry door has been installed upside down. \\n(iii) \\nhardwood flooring was installed in the main floor living room with gaps \\nbetween the hardwood and baseboard; \\n(iv) \\nthe sump pump has been installed in a manner resulting in it continuously \\noperating; \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n(v) \\nthe drainage outlet for the sump pump has been poorly installed at the front \\nof house near the entrance and foundation; \\n(vi) \\nmany masonry joints were not constructed properly; \\n(vii) \\nan insulation void was left within the basement rim joist at the wall adjacent \\nto the garage, resulting in excessive draft to the space above; \\n(viii) condensate drain lines of the furnace were improperly installed and run \\nhaphazardly on the floor; \\n(ix) \\na poor quality 2x4 wooden retaining wall was installed at the north-east \\nsection of the property; and  \\n(x) \\nattic insulation has been installed in a manner restricting soffit ventilation. \\n(d) \\nIncomplete work: \\n(i) \\na closet organization system was not installed in the master bedroom; and \\n(ii) \\na backyard deck was not constructed as agreed. \\n[14] \\nWith one exception, the affidavit evidence and supplementary testimony of Mr. Chelliah \\nsupport that all of these items were within Galaxy’s scope of work.  Galaxy had the opportunity to \\nappear at trial to dispute the Owners’ evidence.  It did not.  Mr.  Chelliah’s evidence is thereby \\nentirely unchallenged.   \\n[15] \\nThe exception is the closet organization system.  I was directed to nothing in evidence at \\ntrial supporting that it was included in the contract drawings or part of the contract scope of work.  \\nNo direct evidence was given on it.  It is only addressed in the Owners’ Scott Schedule, which was \\nincorporated into the evidence of each of the Owners through their affidavits.  Item no. 13 states, \\n“Plaintiff’s representative (M. Maheshwaran) made oral representation to Defendants that master \\ncloset would have closet organization system installed.  Not completed.”  However, no details \\nabout the alleged oral representation have been provided by any witness, including when and to \\nwhom the representation was made and whether any pricing was discussed.  I am not satisfied that \\nMr. Chelliah has met his onus of proving that Galaxy agreed to supply the closet organization \\nsystem.  \\n[16] \\nI accordingly find that all of the alleged deficient and incomplete work claimed by \\nMr. Chelliah, except for the closet organization system, is within Galaxy’s contractual scope of \\nwork.  \\nb. \\nWas Galaxy’s work deficient or incomplete? \\n[17] \\nAlbeit that Galaxy did not appear to defend at trial, Mr. Chelliah’s claim is for unliquidated \\ndamages.  He therefore still has the evidentiary burden of establishing that the work was deficient \\nor incomplete, as alleged. \\n[18] \\nMr. Chelliah did not give direct evidence on each of the alleged deficiencies, unapproved \\nchanges, and incomplete work, but did for many.  Ms. Arunakirinathan’s evidence supports \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nMr. Chelliah’s evidence, but does not add anything new that is particularly relevant to deciding \\nwhether the work was deficient or incomplete.  Jeff Clarke was qualified at trial as an expert in \\nhome construction and renovation deficiencies and costing of home construction deficiency \\nrectification and completion work.  Mr. Chelliah also relies on Mr. Clarke’s evidence with respect \\nto deficiencies and incomplete work. \\ni. Windows \\n[19] \\nI have no hesitation finding that the alleged deficiencies in window installation have been \\nmade out.  To say that Galaxy’s window installation was a disaster is not an understatement.  \\nA simple comparison of the photographs to the drawings demonstrates clear variances from the \\ndrawings and asymmetry in window installation.  \\n[20] \\nThe evidence at trial supports that windows are obviously misaligned from one another in \\nthe actual construction, despite the contract drawings depicting aligned windows.  Mr. Chelliah \\ngave specific evidence on that misalignment, as well as evidence supporting that the two side \\nwindows, the basement window, and the three round decorative windows above the garage were \\nnot installed.  His evidence also supports that certain window lintels are missing and that there is \\nan overall asymmetry to window installation.  Mr. Chelliah also gave evidence on missing \\naluminum grills and sealing problems with the supplied windows.  He testified specifically that \\nthat the windows leaked. \\n[21] \\nMr. Clarke’s expert testimony supports Mr. Chelliah’s evidence.  He provided greater \\ndetail on his own first-hand observations on the missing windows, misaligned windows, and \\nwindow variations from the contract drawings.  He testified that he suspects that the problem stems \\nfrom improper window framing, but whether the problem arose from improper framing, improper \\nwindow installation, improper supervision of trades, or something else, Galaxy was responsible \\nfor constructing the home in accordance with the contract drawings.  The as-built windows do not \\nconform with the drawings. \\nii. Unapproved design changes \\n[22] \\nFive unapproved design changes were advanced at trial:  relocating the laundry room, \\nrelocating the furnace, redesign of the second floor landing, relocating the living room fireplace, \\nand varying the roof design. \\n[23] \\nLaundry room relocation:  I am satisfied and find that the laundry room location does not \\nconform with the contract drawings and relocating it was not an approved change.  Mr. Chelliah’s \\nevidence is that the drawings called for a main floor laundry room, but that Galaxy installed a \\ncloset there.  The laundry machines were instead put in the basement.  Mayuran Maheshwaran is \\nsaid to have advised toward the end of construction that “there was no room for the main floor \\nlaundry.”   \\n[24] \\nDuring his testimony, Mr. Clarke pointed out the main floor “mud laundry” room on the \\ncontract drawings.  He testified that it was a typical layout and confirmed that a closet was built \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nwhere the mudroom should have been.  He further testified that, in his opinion, there was sufficient \\nspace for a mudroom/laundry room to be constructed in the as-built space.   \\n[25] \\nFurnace relocation:  I am satisfied and find that the furnace room location does not \\nconform with the contract drawings and relocating it was not an approved change.  Mr. Chelliah’s \\nevidence is that the furnace was supposed to be installed in the centre of the basement, but was \\ninstead installed by Galaxy along the rear wall.  During his testimony, Mr. Clarke pointed out the \\nlocation of the furnace on the contract drawings and identified where on the rear wall it was \\nactually installed. Mr. Chelliah’s affidavit states that Galaxy moved the furnace without the \\nOwners’ agreement and that they only learned of the change after taking possession in 2018.  They \\nnoticed inadequate airflow to the second floor bedrooms at the front of the house.  Galaxy’s project \\nmanager, “Rushak”, is said to have confirmed that the furnace was too small to blow enough air \\nto the front of the house.  Mr. Chelliah’s evidence is undisputed. \\n[26] \\nSecond floor landing redesign:  I am satisfied and find that Galaxy changed the design of \\nthe second floor landing without approval.  Photographs tendered and the evidence at trial supports \\nthat Galaxy did not comply with the contract drawings by unilaterally constructing a closet on the \\nsecond floor landing in an area that was supposed to be an open space with a window (one of the \\nwindows that was not installed). \\n[27] \\nFireplace relocation: I am satisfied and find that the fireplace location on the main floor \\ndoes not conform with the contract drawings and relocating it was not an approved change.  \\nMr. Chelliah’s evidence is that Galaxy unilaterally relocated the living room fireplace from the \\nside yard wall to the rear yard wall in the centre of what was supposed to be the main window in \\nthe family room.  His affidavit evidence is that the change has resulted in light being blocked from \\nentering the room and that, from the outside, it looks like Galaxy partially built over a window.  \\nHaving seen the photographs, that description is accurate.   \\n[28] \\nSince Galaxy did not appear at trial or tender any responding evidence, there is no evidence \\nexplaining the design change.  The drawings clearly called for a side fireplace and a large window \\nfacing the rear yard.  Mr. Chelliah’s evidence, supported by Ms. Arunakirinathan, is that that \\nOwners did not agree to or approve any change.  That is undisputed.  The as-built fireplace does \\nnot conform with the drawings. \\n[29] \\nMr. Clarke provided opinion evidence on potential reasons for moving the fireplace and \\nwhy, in his opinion, it did not have to be moved even if a City inspector would not permit a vent \\non the north wall.  He opined that vertical venting was possible.  Although helpful during trial to \\nunderstand the issue, I need not consider these hypotheticals.  Galaxy has not put forward any \\nexplanation for the change.  It is enough that an unapproved change was made. \\n[30] \\nRoof design changes:  I am satisfied and find that the roof design was changed from the \\ncontract drawings and that the changes were not approved.  Mr. Chelliah gave evidence that the \\nroof was not built in line with the drawings.  Specifically, his evidence is that the height in the attic \\nand the height of the roof elevation does not match the drawings and the pitch of the roof is not \\nsteep enough.  Mr. Clarke’s evidence comparing the contract drawings to the as-built photographs \\nsupports the variations. \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\niii. Poor quality workmanship \\n[31] \\nPoor quality workmanship is alleged in the master bathroom, installation of a garage entry \\ndoor light, installation of hardwood flooring, installation of the sump pump and related drainage, \\nmortaring of masonry joints, insulation in a garage-adjacent wall, installation of furnace \\ncondensate drain lines, construction of a retaining wall, attic installation. \\n[32] \\nI find that Mr. Chelliah has proven the alleged poor quality workmanship.  Both \\nMr. Chelliah and Mr. Clarke gave evidence, supported by the photographs tendered, confirming \\nthe following: \\n(a) \\nthere are various leaks in the master bathroom; \\n(b) \\nthe garage entry door light was quite evidently installed upside down; \\n(c) \\nthere are gaps in the hardwood flooring requiring filling; \\n(d) \\nthe sump pump runs an abnormal amount of time and the discharge hose was \\nimproperly installed above-ground outside of the house resulting in water freezing \\non the front walkway; \\n(e) \\nthere are gaps in the mortar around the house; \\n(f) \\ninsulation was not installed between the basement and the garage; \\n(g) \\ncondensate lines from the furnace have been placed haphazardly and represent a \\ntrip hazard; \\n(h) \\nthat a 2x4 wood retaining wall used by Galaxy across two or three fence sections \\nto bridge a one-foot gap in grading with the neighbour’s property lacked lateral \\nrestraint, was inappropriate material to sue, and is shifting; and \\n(i) \\nloose insulation was sprayed into the attic space resulting in restricted soffit venting \\nareas and (as Mr. Clarke characterized it during his testimony) “zero soffit venting \\nin th[e] house”. \\niv. Incomplete work \\n[33] \\nAs previously noted, two items of incomplete work are alleged:  installation of a closet \\norganization system in the master bedroom and construction of a backyard deck.  I have already \\nfound that Mr. Chelliah has not proven that Galaxy agreed to supply and install the closet \\norganization system.  That leaves the backyard deck.  I am satisfied that there was an agreement \\nto supply and install a backyard deck, which was not completed.  \\n[34] \\nA backyard deck is not reflected in the contract drawings.  During his examination, \\nMr. Clarke reviewed the drawings and confirmed that he was mistaken when he wrote in his report \\nthat the deck was on the plans. \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[35] \\nMr. Chelliah’s uncontested evidence is that Mayuran Maheshwaran promised that Galaxy \\nwould build a deck in the backyard after the final grading was complete, but did not do so.  At the \\ntime, the patio door in the kitchen was blocked off for occupancy inspection.  There were not yet \\nany stairs to the backyard.  Ms. Arunakirinathan’s evidence is the same:  she was told by both \\n“Rushak” and Mr. Maheshwaran that Galaxy would build the deck after grading was complete.  \\nGrading was completed in May 2021, as confirmed in an email tendered in evidence.  \\nMr. Chelliah’s evidence is that Galaxy did not return to build the deck. \\nc. \\nDid Galaxy breach the contract? \\n[36] \\nThe terms of the contract are undisputed.  As noted earlier in these reasons, the construction \\ncontract expressly requires that the house be built per the specifications and approved drawings \\nattached to the contract.  Per the contract, work was estimated to be completed by December 1, \\n2017, but contractually required to be completed by no later than February 28, 2018.  It is a fixed \\nprice contract indicating that the total cost of construction was to be $650,000, including HST, \\nwith an additional $600,000 identified for the price of purchasing the land. \\n[37] \\nThe Owners’ evidence on deficiencies and incomplete work is undisputed.  It amply \\nsupports a failure by Galaxy to perform the work as agreed and depicted in the contract drawings, \\nwhich I find was a breach of contract. \\n[38] \\nThe contractual completion deadline was also breached.  Mr. Chelliah’s evidence is that, \\nwhen the February 28, 2018 deadline could not be met, Mayuran Maheshwaran told the Owners \\nthat the house would be ready for the end of April 2018.  The evidentiary record supports that \\nan occupancy permit was not issued until July 12, 2018 and that deficiency rectification work \\ncontinued well after that time.  Notably, hardwood flooring deficiencies continued to be rectified \\nuntil November 2018, at which point the Owners were finally able to move in after the deficient \\nflooring was replaced in October-November 2018.  That evidence on delay is also undisputed.  \\nGalaxy’s delays are unexplained.  The uncontested evidence supports a further breach of contract \\nfor delayed performance.  \\n[39] \\nThere is a default provision in the contract that requires Mr. Chelliah to provide written \\nnotice of default to Galaxy.  The undisputed evidence before me from Mr. Chelliah is that he and \\nMs. Arunakirinathan had not seen the construction contract before the day they signed it, which \\nwas during a short thirty minute meeting with Mr. Maheshwaran, who told Mr. Chelliah where to \\nsign.  Mr. Chelliah’s evidence tends to support that Mr. Maheshwaran did not expressly advise \\nhim about the notice clause nor was it noted.  I accept the Owners’ argument that, to the extent the \\nnotice provision that Galaxy drafted is an exculpatory clause, Galaxy was obliged to draw specific \\nattention to it and did not. \\n[40] \\nIn any event, I also accept the Owners’ alternate argument that sufficient notice was \\nprovided in the course of this litigation, particularly by way of the Scott Schedule.  Galaxy \\npreserved its lien in November 2018, which is the same month in which the Owners moved into \\nthe property.  I accept that notice of the deficiencies and incomplete work could not reasonably \\nhave been given until after the Owners took occupancy, by which time Galaxy’s lien had been \\nregistered.  The Owners submit that providing notice in the context of this litigation is not \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nunreasonable and constitutes valid notice under the contract.  I question that position, but Galaxy \\ndid not appear to argue against it.  Absent a challenge, I accept that, on a balance of probabilities, \\nthe notice provision was factually met by giving notice of the deficiencies and incomplete work in \\nthe course of this litigation.  Galaxy did not remedy its default. \\n[41] \\nI accordingly find that Galaxy breached the contract both by reason of failing to comply \\nwith the contract drawings and by unreasonable and unexplained delays in its work.  \\nd. \\nWhat alleged losses or damages have been proven? \\n[42] \\nIn a home construction case such as this one, a homeowner’s damages from a breach of \\ncontract by the contractor commonly include the cost to rectify deficiencies in the contractor’s \\nwork, the cost to complete the work, losses or damages from delay in completing the work, and \\nother costs incurred by the homeowner, such as borrowing costs.   \\n[43] \\nAs set out in Cornelius Grey Construction Inc. v. Folz, 2018 ONSC 647, at para. 15, the \\ncourt must be fair when assessing damages, keeping the objective of contractual damages in mind.  \\nThat objective is to put the innocent party into the position they would have been in had the contract \\nbeen fulfilled.  Costs of rectifying deficiencies and completing the work must be proven to be \\nreasonable and necessary.  All damages claimed by the homeowners must be recoverable at law \\nand must flow unavoidably from the breach of contract. \\n[44] \\nDuring closing submissions, the quantum of judgment sought was revised to reflect certain \\nevidence at trial.  Judgment is sought based on Jeff Clarke’s calculation in Section 5.2 of his report, \\nnamely $125,380.70 as quantified, plus project management and HST, as well as a further \\n$100,000 for window positioning rectification work and $50,000 as damages for the height \\nvariation of the roof.  Mr. Chelliah acknowledges that there should be credits given for the amounts \\nthat Mr. Clarke conceded during examination could be saved. \\n[45] \\nThe evidence on damages is undisputed, but Galaxy’s failure to appear at trial does not \\nrender the trial process a perfunctory rubber stamp.  It remains Mr. Chelliah’s onus to prove that \\nhe has suffered the claimed damages as a result of Galaxy’s breach of contract.   \\n[46] \\nQuantification of the claim for deficiency rectification and completion costs is based on \\nMr. Clarke’s inspection and cost estimations.  Mr. Clarke relies, in part, on estimates obtained by \\nthe Owners from Ratna Renovation (for laundry room and backyard-related work) and Niva Care \\n(for window-related work), which were considered by Mr. Clarke in his own estimation process.   \\n[47] \\nDuring his expert testimony, Mr. Clarke was taken through his “Financial Summary” in \\nsection 5.2 of his report.  He reviewed each of the items, referring to photographs he had taken and \\ndiscussing both the required work to remedy each item and the rationale behind his costing.  \\nI found his opinion evidence on the required work and costing to be helpful and carefully \\nconsidered and assessed.  They are supported by his expertise and, in some cases, by the third party \\nestimates obtained by the Owners.  Absent any cross-examination or argument disputing \\nMr. Clarke’s assessment,  I find no basis to interfere with his estimates for remediation or \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\ncompletion of each line item.  I thereby accept Mr. Clarke’s cost estimates to complete the work, \\nsubject to a few exceptions discussed further below. \\n[48] \\nI need not go through each of the twenty-four items in detail.  A few examples serve to \\noutline the manner in which Mr. Clarke approached his assessment of the work required and his \\nestimation on costs.   \\n[49] \\nWith respect to the mudroom, Mr. Clarke estimates the loss at $9,500, comprised of \\n$11,000 less a $1,500 credit for the existing laundry connections.  In his opinion, the estimate \\nobtained by the Owners from Rantra Renovation to complete the necessary work for $11,000 is \\nreasonable.  He testified that a lot of plumbing work would be required, including retrofitting \\ndrains, as well as destructive work on the second floor to install plumbing vents.  Electrical \\nretrofitting would also be required.   \\n[50] \\nWith respect to the various window deficiencies, Mr. Clarke’s testimony involved \\nexplaining the process required to perform required deficiency remediation and complete \\noutstanding work.  He explained his cost estimation.  That included discussing difficulties with \\nretrofitting many of the windows and why he found the estimate by Niva Care (obtained by the \\nOwners) to perform window-related work to be reasonable.  Mr. Clarke explained the scope of \\nwork that would be required with reference to the Niva Care estimate.  He further explained the \\nrequired work and his own estimating for other windows not addressed in the Niva Care estimate.  \\nHe was taken through each of the windows with reference to his report and discussed relevant \\nOntario Building Code requirements.  I accept his evidence and quantification of the remedial and \\ncompletion costs.  \\n[51] \\nUltimately, Mr. Clarke testified that the window work, estimated in the range of $95,000 \\nto $115,000, could be completed for $100,000 if all windows were being done.  In closing \\nsubmissions, that $100,000 figure was advanced by Mr. Chelliah.  \\n[52] \\nWith specific respect to the missing three round decorative windows above the garage, \\nI accept Mr. Clarke’s estimate of $21,000 to retrofit and complete those windows apart from his \\nestimated range of $95,000 to $115,000 for the other windows.  Mr. Clarke testified that it would \\nbe the same cost if Galaxy had performed that work itself.  This was not an extra, though.  The \\nwindows were identified in the contract drawings. \\n[53] \\nWith respect to the furnace relocation, I am satisfied that Mr. Chelliah has suffered \\ndamages from the furnace relocation.  Mr. Clarke’s testimony confirmed that for functional reasons \\na furnace should be close to the centre of a house and not at the extreme front or rear of the house.  \\nHe testified that a furnace is only able to push air so far and that, although it was not a cold day \\nwhen he inspected, he has never before seen ductwork like what Galaxy installed.  He testified that \\nit would be asking too much to have the installed furnace push air 50 feet across the basement and \\na further 15 feet up to the bedrooms, one of which is above the garage.  He also gave testimony on \\nthe number of duct elbows used, which he indicated adds the equivalent of 15 feet due to the \\nrestriction in airflow velocity through the elbow. \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[54] \\nMr. Chelliah’s undisputed evidence is that there are airflow problems, particularly in the \\nsecond floor bedrooms at the front of the house.  That correlates with Mr. Clarke’s testimony that \\nthe actual furnace installation location would impact airflow.  Those airflow concerns are sufficient \\nto support damages flowing from the improper installation.  Mr. Clarke testified about the work \\nrequired to reposition the furnace and his calculation of the estimate of $7,000 for that work.  \\nI accept his evidence.  \\n[55] \\nMr. Clarke’s evidence for the other items followed a similar pattern.  It was more than \\nsufficient to support his assessment on each of them. \\n[56] \\nAlthough I accept Mr. Clarke’s evidence on quantification of the remedial and completion \\nwork, I nevertheless have a few concerns with Mr. Clarke’s damages quantification, as follows: \\n(a) \\nDuring Mr. Clarke’s testimony, he identified $7,000 in costs savings if all other \\nremedial work was being performed, specifically savings in respect of closets \\n($1,500 if a window were to be installed on the second floor landing), fireplace \\nrelocation ($3,000 in masonry costs), and mortar joint rectification (as much as \\n$2,500 in masonry costs); \\n(b) \\nMr. Clarke also testified that the cost to remediate the furnace condensate drain \\nlines ($700 claimed) would be moot if the furnace is relocated.  He stated that the \\nexisting laundry facility drain could be used for the same purpose; \\n(c) \\nI was directed to no term of the contract requiring Galaxy to install the backyard \\ndeck.  I accept the evidence of Mr. Chelliah and Ms. Arunakirinathan that Mayuran \\nMaheshwaran and “Rushak” made representations about providing it, but there is \\nno evidence before me that Galaxy agreed to perform that work as part of the base \\ncontract price and not as a compensable extra; \\n(d) \\nMr. Clarke confirmed that the variance in roof height from 18-inches as designed \\nto 14-inches as-built has no functional impact whatsoever; \\n(e) \\nNo evidence was given on calculation of the 18% project management fee included \\nin Mr. Clarke’s “Financial Summary”; and \\n(f) \\nMr. Clarke confirmed that the costs of remediation and completion in his estimates \\nwould have been at least 15% lower if the work had been performed prior to the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, which took place several years into this litigation. \\n[57] \\nFor the above reasons, I accept Mr. Clarke’s calculation of $125,380.70 in Section 5.2 of \\nhis report as the subtotal of deficiencies and incomplete work.  I find that Galaxy is entitled to \\ncredit for the savings identified by Mr. Clarke during his examination if all remedial and \\ncompletion work is done, rather than being done on a piecemeal basis, namely $7,700 as outlined \\nin paras. 56(a) and (b) above.  I accept Mr. Clarke’s evidence on the cost of rectifying the window \\nposition issues being $100,000 if all window work is done, which is the position taken by Mr. \\nChelliah in closing submissions.  That totals $217,680.70. \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[58] \\nI find that Mr. Chelliah has not proven damages for the backyard deck.  As noted, I accept \\nthe Owners’ evidence that Galaxy represented it would be constructed, but Mr. Chelliah has not \\nproven that Galaxy agreed to complete the work as part of the base contract scope of work.  It is \\nnot part of the base contract scope of work as outlined in the contract and contract drawings.  There \\nis no evidence on any discussion on the price of performing the deck construction.  Although \\nI accept Mr. Clarke’s estimates as being the reasonable cost of completing the work, there is no \\nevidence on what the work would have cost had Galaxy performed it.  I accordingly cannot find \\nthat Mr. Clarke’s estimated cost to complete is any greater than what Galaxy would have been \\nentitled to charge as an extra.  Damages have not been proven. \\n[59] \\nSimilarly, I find that damages have not been proven for the alleged height issue with the \\nroof.  Mr. Clarke’s testimony is that there is no functional concern with the height variation.  \\nNeither Mr. Chelliah nor Ms. Arunakirinathan gave any evidence on damages beyond the fact that \\nthe height does not match the drawings.  For example, neither testified that they were bothered by \\nthe aesthetic variation or that they have experienced any functional concerns.  In addition, neither \\nexpressed any intention to correct the height variance.  In my view, the fact that an as-built \\ncondition does not strictly comply with contract documents does not itself entitle the opposite party \\nto damages.  There must be some loss occasioned by the non-conformity.  There is no evidence \\nbefore me of any concern with functionality or aesthetics of the roof.  The record thereby does not \\nsupport a finding of loss or damages from Galaxy’s variation in the as-built roof height. \\n[60] \\nWith respect to the claim for a project management fee, as noted above, no evidence has \\nbeen tendered on the 18% claimed.  Mr. Clarke was not asked to explain it and does not do so in \\nhis report.  I accept the closing submission that the various trades will need to be coordinated, but \\ncannot accept 18% as an industry norm without some evidence to support it.  I accordingly find \\nthat 10% is a reasonable project management fee markup to be applied. \\n[61] \\nWith respect to delay damages, Mr. Chelliah claims $18,000 in rent and a further $1,650 \\nin motel expenses.  Mr. Chelliah’s evidence is that $18,000 in rent was incurred between \\nMarch 2018 and the end of November 2018.  During that time, their old property had been sold \\nand the Owners were waiting for Galaxy to finish the work.  The Owners rented the basement of \\na house owned by Mr. Arunakirinathan’s brother, Mukunthan Kanagasabai, for $2,000 per month.  \\nThat is corroborated by Mr. Kanagasabai’s undisputed affidavit evidence, who also confirms \\npayment of the $2,000 per month.  Given my finding that Galaxy breached the contract by delayed \\nperformance of the work, I find that the rental expenses incurred until the Owners’ were able to \\nmove into the subject property are damages flowing from Galaxy’s breach of contract. \\n[62] \\nMr. Chelliah also claims $1,650 in motel expenses for periods in time when his parents \\nwere put up in a motel.  Mr. Chelliah’s undisputed evidence is that, at the material times, his \\nparents lived with the Owners and their children.  His mother has since passed away.  \\nMr. Chelliah’s affidavit evidence is that his parents were unhappy in the basement of \\nMr. Kanagasabai’s house and, intermittently, he rented a motel for them to use at a rate of $560 \\nper week. \\n[63] \\nThe calculation of $1,650 is unclear.  No evidence was given on the specific dates for which \\nMr. Chelliah’s parents stayed in the motel.  Although they live with Mr. Chelliah and his family, \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nthere is no evidence that they are dependents of Mr. Chelliah nor is there evidence addressing \\nwhether they can or do financially contribute to the household.  I have difficulty finding that motel \\ncosts for Mr. Chelliah’s parents are reasonably foreseeable damages flowing from Galaxy’s \\ndelayed performance of the construction. \\n[64] \\nIn any event, Mr. Chelliah’s evidence is that the Owners did not keep all of the receipts \\nfrom the motel, but did locate one.  That single receipt supports a charge of $560 for the Maple \\nLeaf Motel in Scarborough from October 7-13, 2018.  It has not been correlated to the $1,650 \\nclaim advanced at trial.  I accordingly find that Mr. Chelliah has not met his evidentiary burden of \\nproving the quantum of claimed motel costs or that those costs are properly damages flowing from \\nthe breach of contract. \\n[65] \\nCalculating a homeowner’s damages requires comparing the total cost to complete the \\ncontract against the cost that would have been incurred under the original contract:  Cornelius \\nGrey Construction Inc., supra at para. 67.  There is no evidence on the amounts paid to Galaxy \\nunder the construction contract or the state of accounts.  \\n[66] \\nMr. Chelliah argues that, since Galaxy did not pursue its claim for payment, there should \\nbe no deduction from proven damages.  No case law was tendered in support of that position.  \\nI have some difficulty with the argument, but acknowledge that the total base contract price for \\nconstruction work was $650,000, that Galaxy liened for only $112,632, that the Owners disputed \\nthat claim, and that Galaxy opted not to appear to prove the claimed unpaid balance.  Although the \\nOwners have not tendered positive evidence on the state of accounts, so too have they been left \\nwith a house with substantial deficiencies requiring rectification.  In my view, the equities of this \\ncase favour not overthinking defences that Galaxy could itself have advanced at trial, but has \\nelected not to make by disengaging entirely from the litigation process. \\n[67] \\nI accordingly find that the following damages have been proven: \\nProven rectification and completion costs (as above) \\n$ 217,680.70 \\nAllowed project management markup (10%) \\n \\n21,768.07 \\nSubtotal \\n$ 239,448.77 \\nHST \\n \\n31,128.34 \\nRevised subtotal \\n$ 270,577.11 \\nProven delay damages (rent paid) \\n \\n18,000.00 \\nTotal damages \\n$ 288,577.10 \\n[68] \\nAll damages are subject to the duty to mitigate:  Cornelius Grey Construction Inc., supra \\nat para. 68.  Remedial work has not been completed.  Mr. Chelliah’s evidence is that the Owners \\nhave not had the ability to pay to fix the remaining issues.  They went into debt to have Galaxy \\nconstruct the house and have had to pay legal fees after Galaxy commenced litigation.  I accept \\nthat evidence.   \\n[69] \\nGalaxy has not appeared to put forward any argument on how the damages could have been \\nmitigated in these circumstances or how Mr. Chelliah failed to take reasonable steps to do so.  \\nI thereby find that Mr. Chelliah’s damages could not have been mitigated, since the undisputed \\n2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nevidence is that remedial and completion work could not have proceeded sooner by reason of the \\nOwners’ financial circumstances. \\nIV. \\nPRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST & COSTS \\n[70] \\nMr. Chelliah seeks pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Courts of Justice Act from the \\ndate of the occupancy permit issuance on July 12, 2018.  The Owners concede that they willingly \\nwaited for occupancy, but submit that they ought to have been able to take possession upon \\noccupancy, which would also be the date by which most deficiencies were present.  I find that \\nposition makes sense and, since it is undisputed, I am granting it. \\n[71] \\nThe Owners seek their costs of the action and this reference in the amount of $34,020, plus \\nHST and disbursements, representing partial indemnity costs of $15,435 to the date of the Owners’ \\noffer to settle in November 2022, plus substantial indemnity costs of $18,585 from the date of the \\noffer to trial.  The Owners offered to settle the action on payment of $90,000 to Galaxy, with no \\ncosts payable to the Owners if accepted by November 25, 2022 and partial indemnity costs payable \\nthereafter in an amount to be agreed or assessed.  The result of trial is clearly far more favourable \\nto the Owners than their offer to settle. \\n[72] \\nI have broad discretion as to costs in s. 86 of the Construction Act, including discretion to \\naward costs on a substantial indemnity basis.  Given the quantum and issues in dispute, I find the \\nhours spent, rates claimed, and disbursements incurred to be reasonable and proportionate.  I do \\nnot have Galaxy’s bill of costs, but have no hesitation in finding that the amounts claimed ought \\nto be well within reasonable expectations of Galaxy for litigation of this nature, which involved \\nsix hearings for trial directions before me.   \\n[73] \\nI also agree with the Owners that Galaxy’s conduct is a relevant factor in costs.  Additional \\ntime and expense was incurred by reason of Galaxy’s threat of bankruptcy, which never \\nmaterialized.  Galaxy repeatedly breached orders and failed to appear at trial.  Galaxy had evidently \\nabandoned its claim, but still waited until the morning of trial commencing to release its lien. \\n[74] \\nConsidering the factors in subrule 57.01(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, RRO 1990, \\nReg 194 and the Owners’ offer to settle, I find no basis to reduce the costs claim.  I accordingly \\nfix the Owners’ costs of the action and this reference in the amount of $34,020, plus HST, plus \\nclaimed disbursements of $6,839.67, for a total of $45,282.27. \\nV. \\nDISPOSITION \\n[75] \\nFor the above reasons, Mr. Chelliah shall have judgment against Galaxy for $288,577.10, \\nincluding HST, plus pre-judgment interest from July 12, 2018 pursuant to the Courts of Justice \\nAct.  Galaxy shall further pay to the Owners their costs of this action and the reference fixed in the \\namount of $45,282.27, including HST and disbursements, payable within thirty (30) days of \\nconfirmation of my report.

PRESSER J. \\nI. \\nOVERVIEW \\n \\n[1] \\nThis is a decision on Stage One of an application by Tommy Lahens for production of \\nprivate records relating to the complainant, N.C. \\n[2] \\nMr. Lahens is charged with human trafficking, receiving a material benefit from human \\ntrafficking, withholding documents of a trafficked person, receiving a material benefit from sexual \\nservices, procuring, and two counts of assault causing bodily harm. The charges stem from events \\nPUBLICATION BAN \\nThe proceedings were held in camera, as required by s. 278.4(1) of the Criminal Code. Subject \\nto any further order by a court of competent jurisdiction, pursuant to s. 278.9 of the Criminal \\nCode, no person shall publish in any document, or broadcast or transmit in any way, the \\ncontents of the application record, the evidence taken and submissions made at the hearing, or \\nthese reasons for decision. This ban does not apply to publication of these reasons in law \\nreports nor to a discussion of the underlying legal principles in other publications, pursuant to \\ns, 278.9(c) of the Criminal Code, provided that the identity of the complainant and any \\nidentifying information about her is not revealed. \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nalleged to have taken place between March 2018 and March 2021 when the complainant was \\nworking in the sex trade.  \\n[3] \\nDuring the investigation, police obtained personal records from and relating to the \\ncomplainant. These consist of N.C.’s medical records from two hospital visits following alleged \\nassaults by the applicant, and a download of the entire contents of N.C.’s personal cellphone, \\nincluding her communications, banking records, geolocation information, web browsing history, \\nphotographs, and more. Both parties and amicus curiae agree that these are records that attract a \\nhigh expectation of privacy, and that they are records within the meaning of s. 278.1 of the \\nCriminal Code. The cellphone records also engage the privacy interests of third parties with whom \\nthe complainant communicated, and who appear in her photographs. \\n[4] \\nThe defence seeks production of some of N.C.’s personal cellphone records that were \\nextracted from her phone under the statutory production regime set out at ss. 278.1 – 278.91 of the \\nCode. \\n[5] \\nThe issue for my determination, as case management judge, at Stage One of this private \\nrecords production application is whether I should order that the records be produced to the court \\nfor review. This requires me to decide whether I am satisfied that the records are “likely relevant \\nto an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify” (s.278.5(1)(b)); and that “the \\nproduction of the record[s] is necessary in the interests of justice” (s. 278.5(1)(c)). \\n[6] \\nFor the following reasons, I have come to the conclusion that the records sought by the \\napplicant are likely relevant and that production is necessary in the interests of justice. The defence \\nStage One application is allowed. The records at issue will be produced to the court for review. \\nII. \\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND \\n[7] \\nThe complainant first contacted police because she was concerned that she might be \\ncriminally charged with frauds she said were perpetrated by the applicant. She provided two \\nstatements to police in March 2021. She told police that the applicant trafficked her for \\napproximately three years, during which time he posted online to advertise her sexual services, \\nexercised control over her, and materially benefitted from her work in the sex trade. The \\ncomplainant also told police that the applicant had assaulted her twice, necessitating medical \\ntreatment at the hospital on two occasions. She said that the applicant used her phone to post online \\nads for her sexual services, to make arrangements in relation to her work in the sex trade, to \\ncommunicate with clients, and to transfer funds. N.C.’s statements to police resulted in the \\napplicant being charged with the above-noted criminal offences. \\n[8] \\nAs part of its investigation, the police obtained N.C.’s medical records relating to her visits \\nto the hospital after the alleged assaults by the applicant, as well as a data dump of the entire \\ncontents of her personal cellphone. As noted, the Crown, defence, and amicus curiae all agree that \\nthese are records that attract a high expectation of privacy, and that they constitute records within \\nthe meaning of s. 278.1 of the Criminal Code. \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n[9] \\nThe Crown gave notice to the defence, as required by s. 278.2(3) of the Criminal Code, \\nthat there were private records relating to the complainant in its possession. The defence did not \\nseek production of these records under the statutory records production regime. \\n[10] \\nThe Crown then brought an application seeking an order permitting it to produce two \\ncategories of records relating to the complainant to the defence. The first category consisted of \\nrecords it intends to adduce at trial (records contained on USB A). The second category consisted \\nof records the Crown does not seek to adduce at trial, but which it considered may be “likely \\nrelevant” to the defence (records contained on USB B). \\n[11] \\nMultiple efforts were made by police and also, ultimately, by amicus curiae to contact the \\ncomplainant. She made it clear that she did not wish to participate either personally or through \\ncounsel in the Crown’s production application. She also made it clear that she did not want her \\nprivate records used in this prosecution. All parties agreed that the complainant did not expressly \\nwaive the operation of the statutory records regime contained in ss. 278.3 to 278.91 of the Code \\nwithin the meaning of s. 278.2(2) as interpreted in R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at paras. 106 \\nand 114. \\n[12] \\nIn light of the legal and factual complexities of the Crown production application, on \\nNovember 14, 2023, I appointed amicus curiae to assist the court: R. v. Lahens, 2023 ONSC 6383.   \\n[13] \\nCrown, defence, and amicus filed written submissions on the Crown production \\napplication. It was heard on December 18, 2024. On January 11, 2024, I released a short \\nendorsement setting out my bottom-line decision, with full written reasons to follow: R. v. Lahens, \\n2024 ONSC 248. Those written reasons are still to follow. In coming to my decision on the \\nCrown’s production application, I only considered production of the records the Crown intends to \\nadduce at trial (records contained on USB A). I ordered some of those records produced to the \\ndefence, some produced to the defence with redactions, and others not produced to the defence.  \\n[14] \\nI did not consider the Crown’s application for production of the second category of records, \\nnamely the records the Crown identified as potentially likely relevant to the defence (records \\ncontained on USB B). It was my view that it was preferable for the defence to seek production \\nunder the statutory records regime for any USB B records it wanted to pursue after receiving \\nproduction of the USB A records. The reason for this preference was that only the defence knows \\nits theory in this case. It is therefore uniquely situated to establish both likely relevance to a live \\nissue at trial, and how records are necessary to Mr. Lahens’s ability to make full answer and \\ndefence as part of the requirement that the production of private records be necessary in the \\ninterests of justice. In my January 11, 2024, endorsement, I indicated that I had not considered \\nproduction of the USB B records, and wanted to wait to see if the defence intended to seek \\nproduction of those records under the statutory records production regime. \\n[15] \\nIn court on January 11, 2024, defence counsel advised that Mr. Lahens would bring an \\napplication for production of the records the Crown had identified as potentially likely relevant \\n(USB B records). The applicant filed his production application on January 22, 2024. Stage One \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nof the defence production application was heard on January 29, 2024. These are my reasons for \\ndecision on Stage One of that application. \\n[16] \\nBetween when the Crown filed its production application and when the defence filed this \\nproduction application, the Crown provided the defence with further disclosure. This consisted of \\ndocuments, materials, and information that, upon further review, the Crown considered not to be \\nrecords because the complainant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in them. This \\nfurther disclosure included: \\n\\uf0b7 All communications between the complainant and the applicant that were extracted from \\nthe complainant’s cellphone; and \\n\\uf0b7 Police-produced detailed maps showing location data for the complainant’s and the \\napplicant’s cellphones during the period covered by the indictment and for several months \\nafter the complainant provided her police statements. \\n[17] \\nIn addition, pursuant to my order for production of records that the Crown intends to adduce \\nat trial following the Crown’s production application, Mr. Lahens will have received the following \\n(some of which I ordered redacted to protect the complainant’s or third parties’ privacy): \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Medical records relating to the complainant’s two attendances at hospital for treatment in \\nrelation to the two alleged assaults by the applicant; \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Screenshots of communications between the complainant’s cellphone and third parties, \\nprimarily relating to sex work; \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Photographs of the complainant and the applicant with the complainant’s dog; \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Some calendar entries that include geotags specific to attendance at the airport; \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Some internet bookmarks; \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The complainant’s call logs; and \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Some messages exchanged by the complainant, including communications: with her \\nmother; with her landlord at 488 University Avenue; relating to a residential tenancy \\nagreement for a Vancouver apartment; with an individual who was going to take her to \\nMontreal; relating to transport from Montreal to Toronto on specific dates; relating to \\ncryptocurrency transactions; relating to banking codes; relating to ordering Viagra; relating \\nto arranging sexual services. \\n \\n[18] \\nOn this production application, Mr. Lahens seeks production of the following records \\nextracted from the complainant’s cellphone, identified as potentially likely relevant to the \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\ndefence by the Crown (records contained on USB B, with page references to the 1700 pages \\nof the complainant’s full cellphone extraction): \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Communications at pages 1-8, 16, 141, 156-157, 163-164, 170, 262-264, 267-268, 273, \\n289, 290, 301-308, 345, 365, 373-377, 1369, 1370-1372, 1508-1509, 1511-1513, 1524-\\n1527, 1532, 1534, 1535, 1538-1547, 1637, 1640-1642, 1644 -1654, 1662-1663, 1671-\\n1674, 1678-1681, 1712; \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Photos at pages 21-68, 108-140; \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Web history at pages 966-988; and \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Information about a Vancouver apartment rental at page 1614. \\n \\nIII. \\nTHE GOVERNING LEGAL REGIME \\n[17] \\nSections 278.2 to 278.91 of the Criminal Code establish the regime that governs production \\nof private records as defined in s. 278.1, relating to a complainant or witness in any proceeding in \\nrespect of the offences enumerated in s. 278.2(1). The applicant is charged with enumerated \\noffences. As noted, all parties to this application agree that the records at issue are private records \\nwithin the meaning of s. 278.1, as do I. Accordingly, this defence production application and any \\norder for production are governed by the statutory records production regime. \\n[18] \\nThe regime is intended to “accommodate and reconcile the rights of the accused to full \\nanswer and defence with the privacy and equality rights of complainants” in prosecutions \\ninvolving enumerated offences. It accomplishes this by ensuring that there is careful judicial \\nscrutiny and limiting of what complainants must be forced to reveal “as the price of [their] access \\nto the criminal justice system”: R. v. Quesnelle, 2014 SCC 46, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 390, at para. 14 \\n[internal citation omitted]. The balancing contemplated by the statutory production regime requires \\nparticular care in this case. The complainant has not waived operation of the regime, and has made \\nit very clear that she neither wants her records to be used at trial, nor to participate in this \\nprosecution. In this way, the complainant maintains her interest in the privacy of her records, but \\nis not present or participating in the process to assert her rights to privacy or equality herself (or \\nthrough her own counsel). At the same time, the applicant’s right to make full answer and defence \\nmust be respected and protected. It too is essential to ensure that he has a fair trial. \\n[19] \\nThe statutory regime sets out a two-stage process. At the first stage, the judge holds a \\nhearing in camera (s. 278.4(1)) to determine whether the records should be produced to the court \\nfor review (s. 278.5(1)). At the second stage, if production to the court has been ordered, the judge \\nreviews the records to determine whether to order production to the defence (s. 278.6(1)). The \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\njudge may hold an in-camera hearing if that will be of assistance with the second stage \\ndetermination (s. 278.6(2)). \\n(1) \\nStage One \\n[20] \\nAt Stage One, records will be produced to the court if the judge is satisfied that:  \\n\\uf0b7 The applicant has met the statutory requirements for bringing a private records production \\napplication set out in ss. 278.3(2) to (6) (s. 278.5(1)(a)); \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The applicant has “established that the record is likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the \\ncompetence of a witness to testify” (s. 278.5(1)(b)); and \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Production of the records is “necessary in the interests of justice” (s. 278.5(1)(c)). \\n[21] \\nUnder s. 278.5(2), in deciding whether to order a record produced in whole or part to the \\ncourt, the judge must consider “the salutary and deleterious effects of the determination on the \\naccused’s right to make full answer and defence and on the right to privacy, personal security and \\nequality of the complainant or witness . . . and of any other person to whom the record relates.” In \\nso doing, the judge must consider the following factors that are statutorily enumerated in s. \\n278.5(2): \\na. The extent to which the record is necessary for the accused to make full answer \\nand defence; \\n \\nb. The probative value of the record; \\n \\nc. The nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the \\nrecord; \\n \\nd. Whether production of the record is based on a discriminatory belief or bias; \\n \\ne. The potential prejudice to the personal dignity and right to privacy of any person \\nto whom the record relates; \\n \\nf. Society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual offences; \\n \\ng. Society’s interest in encouraging the obtaining of treatment by complainants of \\nsexual offences; and \\n \\nh. The effect of the determination on the integrity of the trial process. \\n(i) Likely Relevance \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\n[22] \\nA record will be likely relevant if the applicant established that there is a “reasonable \\npossibility that the information is logically probative to an issue at trial or the competence of a \\nwitness to testify”: R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 22; R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. \\n668, at para. 124. In R. v. Batte (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), at para. 72, the court held that in \\norder to pass the likely relevance threshold, there must be “some basis for concluding that the \\nstatements have some potential to provide the accused with some added information not already \\navailable to the defence or have some potential impeachment value.” \\n[23] \\nThe likely relevance threshold at this first stage is not a significant or onerous burden. It is \\nmeant to prevent requests for production that are “speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious, \\nobstructive, and time-consuming”: Mills, at para. 46, citing O’Connor, at para. 24. The threshold \\nfor likely relevance under s. 278.5(1)(b) is higher than the threshold of relevance for Crown first \\nparty disclosure under R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, which requires disclosure of \\ninformation that “may be useful to the defence”: Mills, at para. 45; Batte, at para. 72. \\n[24] \\nSection 278.3(4) lists a number of assertions that, on their own, cannot meet the likely \\nrelevance threshold. These include, by way of example, “that the record exists” (s. 278.3(4)(a)); \\n“that the record may disclose a prior inconsistent statement of the complainant” (s. 278.3(4)(d); \\n“that the record may relate to the credibility of the complainant” (s. 278.3(4)(e)); and “that the \\nrecord was made close in time to a complaint or to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the \\ncharge against the accused” (s. 278.3(4)(k)). A bare assertion that a record is likely relevant to one \\nof the issues listed in s. 278.3(4) is not sufficient to meet the statutory threshold of likely relevance: \\nMills, at paras. 52, 118. However, an accused may rely on these assertions if there is an \\n“evidentiary or informational foundation to suggest that they may be related to likely relevance”: \\nMills, at para. 120. The accused must point to “case specific evidence or information” to show that \\nthe record is likely relevant to an issue at trial or the competence of a witness to testify: Mills, at \\npara. 120: R. v. K.C., 2021 ONCA 401, 157 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 31, per Jamal J.A. as he then \\nwas, dissenting but not on this point. \\n(ii) Necessary in the Interests of Justice \\n \\n[25] \\nIn addition to establishing that the records they seek are likely relevant, an applicant for \\nproduction must establish that production is necessary in the interests of justice (s. 278.5(1)(c)). \\nAt the first stage, this requires consideration of whether production to the court for review is \\nnecessary in the interests of justice: Mills, at para. 131. The phrase “necessary in the interests of \\njustice” is, according to the Supreme Court in Mills, at paras. 131 and 133: \\n \\n. . . capable of encompassing a great deal. It permits the judge to look at factors \\nother than relevancy, like the privacy rights of complainants and witnesses, in \\ndeciding whether to order production to himself or herself.  . . . \\n \\n. . . \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nThe criterion in s. 278.5 that production must be “necessary in the interests of \\njustice” invests trial judges with the discretion to consider the full range of rights \\nand interests at issue before ordering production, in a manner scrupulously \\nrespectful of the requirements of the Charter. \\n \\n[26] \\nThis is a “wide and flexible” discretion that accords the judge “great latitude”: Mills, at \\npara. 130. It should be exercised in a manner that respects the goals of the statutory records \\nproduction regime: to protect the privacy and equality rights of complainants and witnesses while \\npreserving the fair trial rights of the accused: Quesnelle, at para. 54. \\n[27] \\nWhere the probative value of a record is low and the privacy right in a record is strong, the \\njudge may decide that it is not in the interests of justice to order production: Mills, at para. 131. \\nEven where likely relevance has been established, the court must “consider the rights and interests \\nof all those affected by disclosure before documents are ordered disclosed to the court”: Mills, at \\npara. 126. The judge is “free to make whatever order is ‘necessary in the interests of justice’ – a \\nmandate that includes all of the applicable ‘principles of fundamental justice’ at stake”: Mills, at \\npara. 134. \\n[28] \\nThis will necessarily include consideration of the defendant’s ability to make full answer \\nand defence as a major focus: “[i]f the judge concludes that it is necessary to examine the \\ndocuments at issue in order to determine whether they should be produced to enable the accused \\nto make full answer and defence, then production to the judge is ‘necessary in the interests of \\njustice’”: Mills, at para. 132. Courts have repeatedly warned about the risks of placing the accused \\nin a ‘Catch-22’ situation, in other words, “in the difficult position of making submissions regarding \\nthe importance to full answer and defence of records that he or she has not seen”: Mills, at paras. \\n71 and 137. \\n[29] \\nAt the same time, while the defendant’s right to make full answer and defence is a principle \\nof fundamental justice, the principles of fundamental justice do not entitle the defendant to  \\n“the most favourable procedures that could possibly be imagined” because fundamental justice \\n“embraces more than the rights of the accused”: Mills, at para. 72. The right to make full answer \\nand defence does not comprehend a right to records that are irrelevant or would distort the truth-\\nseeking function of the trial process: R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 443, at para. \\n37. \\n[30] \\nWhere likely relevance has been established, if after considering the all the various rights \\nand factors at play, the judge is uncertain of whether production is necessary to the defendant’s \\nability to make full answer and defence, the judge should “err on the side of production to the \\ncourt”: O’Connor, at para. 152; Mills, at paras. 132 and 137. \\n(2) Stage Two \\n \\n[31] \\nIf the judge orders the records produced to the court for review, the production application \\nmoves on to Stage Two. Here, the judge reviews the records in the absence of the parties to \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\ndetermine whether they should be produced in whole or part to the defendant (s. 278.6(1)), and \\nmay conduct a hearing in camera if that will be of assistance (s. 278.6(2)). \\n[32] \\nAt Stage Two, the judge determines whether the records are likely relevant to an issue at \\ntrial or to the competence of a witness to testify, and whether its production is in the interests of \\njustice (s. 278.7(1)). In so doing, the judge must again consider “the salutary and deleterious effects \\nof the determination on the accused’s right to make full answer and defence and on the right to \\nprivacy, personal security and equality of the complainant or witness . . . and of any other person \\nto whom the record relates” (s.278.7(2)). This requires that the judge take the statutorily \\nenumerated factors for consideration contained in ss. 278.5(2)(a) to (h) into account. The judge \\nmay impose conditions on the production of any records to the defendant (s. 278.7(3)). \\n \\n \\nIV. \\nAPPLICATION TO THIS CASE \\n \\n(1) Positions of the Parties \\n \\n[33] \\nThe defence theory is that “the complainant was in a romantic relationship with the \\napplicant and exercised autonomy while working in the sex trade. The complainant was frequently \\napart from the applicant, routinely under the influence of drugs, engaged in fraud, paranoid, and \\nhad motives to fabricate”: Applicant’s Factum, at para. 18. The applicant submits that the \\ncomplainant was on drugs at the time she made her police statements. He notes that the \\ncomplainant has since said that she does not want to participate in this prosecution, and maintains \\nthat she lied to police. \\n[34] \\nThe applicant takes the position that the records he seeks are “capable of providing \\nevidence of the nature of the complainant’s relationship with the applicant, and its eventual \\nbreakdown, the impact and use of drugs, her consequent paranoia, her involvement in fraud, \\njealousy, motives to fabricate, and her autonomy. It would also reveal the inherent dangers of the \\nsex trade and that the complainant was apart from the Applicant at relevant times”: Applicant’s \\nFactum, at para. 5. The defence submits that “the contents of her phone . . . relate to the allegations, \\nare contemporaneous, and speak to the complainant’s state of mind”; and that “[t]he complainant \\nused her phone during the relevant time to communicate for work, to post ads, to make travel and \\nliving arrangements, to take photographs, to procure drugs, to commit fraud, and to communicate \\nwith the applicant, among other things”: Applicant’s Factum, at paras. 5 and 19. The applicant \\nrelies on R. v. Yabarow, 2019 ONSC 3669, at paras. 23 – 25 as authority for the proposition that \\nthe ubiquitous use of cellphones as a communication device and camera means that they are often \\nable to offer relevant and probative evidence. \\n[35] \\nGiven the regular use of her cellphone in the period covered by the indictment, the defence \\nargues, it can be expected that there would be information in the records that is likely relevant to \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nthe defence theory that she was in a romantic relationship with the applicant and exercised \\nautonomy while working in the sex trade. And that there would be information that is likely \\nrelevant to whether she was frequently apart from the applicant, was under the influence of drugs, \\nwas engaged in fraud with the applicant and therefore had a motive to fabricate to avoid criminal \\nliability. In short, the defence argues that the records are likely relevant to the complainant’s \\ncredibility and reliability. For these reasons, in the defence submission, the threshold of likely \\nrelevance has been met. \\n[36] \\nIn addition, the applicant notes that the Crown has identified the records he seeks as likely \\nrelevant to the defence. Indeed, when it filed its first application for production, the Crown took \\nthat position that if the defence had sought production of these records, they would have met the \\nlikely relevance threshold: Crown Applicant Factum, November 22, 2023, at para. 7. This too, in \\nthe defence argument, supports a finding that the likely relevance requirement has been met. \\n[37] \\nWith respect to the requirement that production be necessary in the interests of justice, the \\napplicant submits that his production application is limited to a relatively small and closed category \\nof documents. He is not seeking production of the entire 1700 pages of data extracted from the \\ncomplainant’s cellphone in addition to those parts that have already been produced to him as a \\nresult of the Crown’s production application. Rather, he is only seeking the data extracted from \\nthe phone that has been flagged by the Crown as likely relevant to the defence. In this way, the \\ndefence argues, the production he seeks is narrowed and involves less potential violation of the \\ncomplainant’s and third parties’ rights to privacy and equality. Effectively, the defence position is \\nthat the potential violations are proportionate and acceptable given the value of the records to his \\nability to make full answer and defence. \\n[38] \\nThe Crown made no submissions on this defence production application. The Crown \\nidentified the records at issue as potentially likely relevant to the defence, and previously indicated \\nit would agree that the likely relevance threshold was met if the defence sought production. In \\nthese circumstances, Crown counsel did not feel it was appropriate for him to make any \\nsubmissions on the defence application. \\n[39] \\nAmicus curiae has reviewed all the records at issue and filed a chart at para. 35 of her \\nfactum, setting out her position in relation to each record by page (or page range). Amicus agrees \\nthat some of the records sought by the applicant are likely relevant to the issues the defence plans \\nto raise at trial, and that it is necessary in the interests of justice to produce some of them to the \\ncourt for review. However, amicus does not agree that all the records are likely relevant and/or \\nnecessary in the interests of justice. Amicus submits that the applicant has already received \\ndisclosure or production of information that is relevant to some of the issues in relation to which \\nhe seeks production of these records. Relying on Batte, at para. 72 and K.C., at paras. 51, 65-67, \\namicus argues that this is an important factor in assessing whether the records sought are likely \\nrelevant and necessary in the interests of justice.  \\n[40] \\nAmicus further submits that the Crown’s initial assessment that the records at issue were \\nlikely relevant should not be given much weight in the circumstances of this application for three \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\nreasons. First, amicus submits, the Crown assessed what records might be likely relevant without \\nknowing the theory of the defence. Likely relevance must always be assessed contextually and \\nwith reference to case-specific factors. Here, exercising its obligation to act as a ‘Minister of \\nJustice,’ the Crown endeavoured to assess potential likely relevance, but it did so in a factual and \\nlegal vacuum. Accordingly, its assessment would necessarily have fallen closer to the Stinchcombe \\nstandard of disclosure – that which may be useful to the defence – than to the more restrictive \\nstandard of “likely relevance” required by the statutory records production regime. \\n[41] \\nSecond, amicus submits that the Crown assessment of likely relevance should not be given \\nmuch weight because the Crown did not assess whether production is necessary in the interests of \\njustice. As a result, the Crown’s identification of likely relevant records did not include \\nconsideration of the potential impact of production on the privacy and equality rights of the \\ncomplainant or third parties. Amicus highlights that the privacy of the complainant is an especially \\nimportant consideration in this case because “the records being sought are cellphone records, \\nincluding the complainant’s communications with others, her personal photographs, and the web \\nhistory of her cellphone – all things which are capable of revealing a great deal of personal \\ninformation about the complainant. Indeed, this fact has been repeatedly recognized by the \\nSupreme Court of Canada in a long line of cases dealing with s. 8 of the Charter and changing \\ntechnology (R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, at paras. 38, 40-45; R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, at para. 51 – \\n58; R. v. Marakah, 2017 SCC 59, at para. 31-37; R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 34, at para. 37)”: Factum \\nof the Amicus Curiae, at para. 34. \\n[42] \\nThird, amicus submits that the Crown assessment of likely relevance was made before a \\nsignificant amount of information, including private records of the complainant, was disclosed or \\nproduced to the defence. As a result, the Crown’s assessment was made without considering \\nwhether the further records sought would provide the applicant with added information not already \\navailable to him. This is relevant to the Batte formulation of likely relevance, and the K.C. \\nformulation of necessity in the interests of justice. \\n[43] \\nFinally, amicus curiae submits that there are two categories of records sought by the \\napplicant for which there is simply no basis for a finding of likely relevance or necessity in the \\ninterests of justice. The first of these categories is photographs on the complainant’s phone. Amicus \\nnotes that some photographs have already been ordered produced to the defence by me (e.g. one \\ncopy of the photographs that include the complainant’s dog). She argues that there is simply no \\nbasis for a conclusion that any further photographs are likely relevant to any issue at trial or to \\nimpeachment of a witness. When considered alongside the very high privacy interest engaged by \\nphotographs on the complainant’s cellphone, which may reveal personal preferences, associations, \\nand intimate situations, the absence of any established likely relevance for the photographs means \\nthat these should not be produced to the court for review. The second category of items sought by \\nthe defence for which, in amicus’ submission, there is simply no basis for production is the \\ncomplainant’s web history. Amicus says that the page range identified as web history also contains \\npersonal images and photographs that are not web history. There is no established relevance for \\nweb browsing history or other photographs to the defence theory or the complainant’s credibility \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nor reliability. And the web history and other items in this page range are of a highly private nature, \\ntending to reveal lifestyle choices and a biographical core of information. \\n(2) Analysis \\n \\n[44] \\nI have decided to order production of the records sought by the applicant to the court for \\nreview. The Applicant has succeeded in establishing likely relevance and that production is \\nnecessary in the interests of justice. \\n(i) \\nLikely Relevance \\n \\n[45] \\nIn my view, the applicant has met his not “significant or onerous burden” of establishing \\nthat there is a “reasonable possibility that the information is logically probative to an issue at trial”: \\nO’Connor, at paras. 22, 24; Mills, at paras. 46, 124. I agree that given the complainant’s regular \\nuse of her cellphone in the period covered by the indictment, there is a reasonable possibility that \\nthe cellphone records contain information that is relevant to the defence theory and to live issues \\nat trial. The records are logically probative, as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 There is a reasonable possibility that the cellphone records will contain communications \\nbetween the complainant and others, and evidence of her plans and movements, that speak \\nto the nature of her relationship with the applicant and her autonomy. There is a reasonable \\npossibility that the photographs on her cellphone will evidence her movements and her \\nassociation with others, that in turn also speak to her autonomy. This is logically probative \\nof whether the applicant exercised control over the complainant, which is an essential \\nelement of the actus reus of some of the human trafficking charges at issue;  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 There is a reasonable possibility that the cellphone records, including her photographs and \\nweb browsing history, will evidence the complainant’s movements at various times in the \\nperiod covered by the indictment. This may contradict information the complainant gave \\npolice in her statements, and in this way they may be logically probative of her credibility \\nand reliability; \\n \\n\\uf0b7 There is a reasonable possibility that the cellphone records will contain evidence that \\nspeaks to the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the applicant in the \\nperiod immediately before she went to the police. This may be logically probative of \\ndifficulties in the relationship or even relationship breakdown, which in turn may support \\na defence argument that the complainant had a motive to fabricate; \\n \\n\\uf0b7 There is a reasonable possibility that the cellphone records will provide evidence that the \\ncomplainant was using drugs, and of the impact of drug use on her. Drug use in the days \\nleading up to the complainant’s statements to police may be relevant to her memory and \\nreliability;  \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 There is a reasonable possibility that the cellphone records will provide evidence that the \\ncomplainant was engaged in fraudulent activities with the applicant.  The complainant’s \\nparticipation in fraud may be logically probative of a motive to fabricate human trafficking \\nand assault allegations against the applicant, in order to avoid criminal liability for having \\nparticipated in fraud. In addition, active and willing participation in fraud, an offence of \\ndishonesty, may be logically probative of the complainant’s credibility. \\n \\n[46] \\nI am satisfied, given the live issues to which the records are possibly reasonably logically \\nprobative, that the defence production application is not “speculative, fanciful, disruptive, \\nunmeritorious, obstructive, and time-consuming”: Mills, at para. 46, citing O’Connor, at para. 24. \\n[47] \\nThe Crown assessment that these records are potentially likely relevant to the defence lends \\nsome further support to my conclusion that they are so at this first stage. I appreciate amicus \\ncuriae’s concerns about placing too much weight on the Crown assessment of likely relevance to \\nthe defence. Indeed, as amicus suggests, the Crown was reviewing the records without knowing \\nthe defence theory. As such, the Crown would necessarily have been applying a broad concept of \\nrelevance. It would necessarily have been considering whether the records may be useful to the \\ndefence, rather than whether the records met the more restrictive threshold of likely relevance that \\nis required for production under the statutory regime.  \\n[48] \\nHowever, at Stage One of this application, I do have the defence theory and its argument \\nas to why there is a reasonable possibility that the records are logically probative of live issues at \\ntrial. The Crown’s assessment of potential likely relevance, even with its limitations, provides \\nsome support to the defence position. It bolsters my conclusion that the records are likely relevant \\nat this first stage. \\n[49] \\nAmicus submits that some of the records sought do not reach the likely relevance threshold \\nbecause they are duplicative of materials already in the defence possession. At para. 29 of her \\nfactum, amicus sets out the live issues to which the defence says the records are relevant, but for \\nwhich he already has other relevant information available to him. I agree that the applicant already \\nhas disclosure and production of materials and records that speak to some of the live issues that \\narise from the defence theory. However, at this stage, I have no way of assessing whether the \\nrecords sought would be merely surplusage, or whether they would provide the applicant with \\nadded information that is not already available to him. I do consider that there is “some basis for \\nconcluding” that the records “have some potential to provide the accused with some added \\ninformation not already available to the defence or have some potential impeachment value”: \\nBatte, at para. 72 [emphasis added]. In these circumstances, I consider it appropriate to order \\nproduction to the court for my review to determine whether the records sought do provide added \\ninformation that is not already available to the applicant from other sources in his possession. \\n(ii) \\nNecessary in the Interests of Justice \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\n[50] \\nHaving assessed the interests of justice, including the protection of the privacy and equality \\nrights of the complainant and third parties while preserving the fair trial rights of the applicant, I \\nhave come to the conclusion that production to the court is necessary. \\n[51] \\nI recognize that the records at issue attract a very high expectation of privacy. In R. v. \\nFearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at para. 51, the Supreme Court recognized that the \\nsearch of cellphones “implicates important privacy interests.” Cellphones “may have immense \\nstorage capacity, may generate information about intimate details of the user’s interests, habits and \\nidentity without the knowledge or intent of the user, may retain information even after the user \\nthinks that it has been destroyed, and may provide access to information that is in no meaningful \\nsense ‘at’ the location of the search”: Fearon, at para. 51, citing R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 \\nS.C.R. 657, at paras. 41-44. There is no question that the records in the complainant’s cellphone \\nhave the ability to reveal intimate details, lifestyle choices, and a biographical core of information \\nabout her. The records also impact on the complainant’s dignity and her right to equality: Mills, at \\nparas. 89-93. \\n[52] \\nThe records at issue may also implicate the privacy interests, dignity, and equality of third \\nparties with whom the complainant communicated or who appear in her photographs. \\n[53] \\nThat some records from the complainant’s phone have already been disclosed and \\nproduced to the defence does not lessen her privacy, equality, and dignity interests in the rest of \\nthe records that have not been produced. Privacy is not an all-or-nothing concept: Quesnelle, at \\npara. 37. \\n[54] \\nIt is especially important to pay careful and respectful attention to the complainant’s \\ndignity, privacy, and equality interests in the circumstances of this case. These are records in which \\nthe complainant has an extremely high expectation of privacy. She has indicated that she does not \\nwant the records used in court, and has effectively indicated that she wants nothing further to do \\nwith this prosecution. She is not present in this application to speak for herself, or assert her own \\nrights. The third parties whose privacy and dignity interests are implicated have no standing on \\nthis application. As a result, they also have not been able to speak for themselves or assert their \\nown rights. Amicus curiae has ably and fairly raised and made submissions about the privacy, \\nequality, and dignity interests of the complainant and third parties, to assist the court. But amicus \\nis not counsel to the complainant, much less the third parties. She is the court’s lawyer. I am very \\nmindful in these particular circumstances that it falls to me to ensure that the privacy, equality, and \\ndignity interests of the complainant and third parties are given full and meaningful consideration \\nin determining what the interests of justice require. \\n[55] \\nAt the same time, the applicant’s fair trial rights and his right to make full answer and \\ndefence must also be given full and meaningful consideration in determining whether the interests \\nof justice necessitate production of the records.  \\n[56] \\nIn my view, the records sought by the defence implicate his right to make full answer and \\ndefence. I am satisfied that there is a reasonable possibility that the cellphone records will contain \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\ninformation that is logically probative of the defence theory, and that may be of assistance to the \\ndefence in raising a reasonable doubt. I am also satisfied that the defence does not seek production \\nbased on a discriminatory belief or bias. \\n[57] \\nThe complainant’s and the third parties’ privacy, equality and dignity interests in the \\nrecords militate against the production sought by the applicant. So too does society’s interest in \\nencouraging the reporting of sexual offences. The applicant’s right to make full answer and \\ndefence militates in favour of production. Neither set of rights trumps or negates the other: Mills, \\nat para. 17. However, in some circumstances, the right to make full answer and defence may \\noverride competing considerations: Mills, at para. 76. A judge considering a production application \\nshould err on the side of ordering production to the court if there is a real risk that non-production \\ncould infringe on the right to make full answer and defence: Mills, at para. 137. \\n[58] \\nI would have concluded that this was a borderline case where I should err on the side of \\nordering production to the court. But two meaningful considerations have tipped me over into a \\nmore firm conclusion that production is necessary in the interests of justice here.  \\n[59] \\nFirst, the applicant only seeks production of a subset of the full cellphone data extraction. \\nHe does not seek all of the information in the Crown’s possession that has been taken from the \\ncomplainant’s phone. He is not proposing to go on a wide-ranging fishing expedition through all \\nof the highly private information relating to the complainant in the hands of the Crown. Rather, he \\nlimits his application to those records that the Crown has flagged as potentially likely relevant. \\nThis is a more limited request than he might have made, and it is one that involves less intrusion \\non the privacy, dignity, and equality interests of the complainant and third parties. This more \\nlimited production request will still adversely impact on the privacy and equality rights of the \\ncomplainant and third parties, but it will do so in a less severe way than broader production would \\nhave. The Crown identified the particular records sought as being potentially likely relevant. I have \\ndetermined that they are likely relevant at this first stage, and that they may assist the applicant in \\nexercising his right to make full answer and defence. As I weigh and balance all of the rights at \\nplay, the targeted nature of the defence application and its lesser intrusion on the complainant’s \\nrights support my conclusion that production is necessary in the interests of justice.  \\n[60] \\nThe second consideration is the potential effect of a decision not to order production on the \\nintegrity of the trial process. In particular, I am concerned about fairness and the appearance of \\nfairness.  \\n[61] \\nThe Crown reviewed the complainant’s private records, identified those that are useful to \\nthe prosecution, and sought production of those to the defence. Many to most of those records \\nwere produced (or were produced with redactions). The Crown intends to rely on them as part of \\nthe prosecution case at trial.  \\n[62] \\nIn the unique circumstances of this case, the Crown also identified records that it thought \\nmight be relevant to the defence. The Crown went so far as to initially seek production of those \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\nrecords to the defence, and it indicated that it would have consented to having those records \\nproduced to the court for review if the defence had sought production under the statutory regime.  \\n[63] \\nIn my view, it could negatively impact on the fairness of the trial process, and on the \\nappearance of fairness, to deny at least Stage One production of these records to the court for \\nreview. The applicant should not be denied production of records because he applied for them, \\nwhen the same records might well have been produced to him on the Crown’s application had he \\nhung back and done nothing to seek them himself.   \\n[64] \\nI agree with amicus’ submissions as to why the Crown’s initial assessment of likely \\nrelevance to the defence cannot be determinative of this application. However, at the highest level \\nof generality, it would not appear fair to the defence to deny production to the court for review of \\nrecords that even the Crown considered might be likely relevant. I considered this general \\nappearance of fairness concern alongside my own assessment that the applicant has met the Stage \\nOne likely relevance threshold, and my own assessment that his right to make full answer and \\ndefence is implicated by these records. I am not allowing Stage One of the defendant’s application \\nbecause the Crown identified the records as potentially likely relevant. But that the Crown did so \\ncontributes a fairness and appearance of fairness concern that weighs in favour of the necessity of \\nfirst stage production in the interests of justice. It is my considered opinion that this is an effect of \\nthe Stage One determination on the integrity of the trial process that weighs in favor of production \\nto the court. \\n[65] \\nAfter careful consideration of all of the factors set out s. 278.5(2)(a) – (h), I have come to \\nthe conclusion that it is necessary in the interests of justice to order production of the records to \\nthe court for review. \\n(3) \\nConclusion \\n \\n[66] \\nHaving considered the salutary and deleterious effects of production on the applicant’s \\nright to make full answer and defence and on the right to privacy, personal security, dignity, and \\nequality of the complainant; as well as the effects of production on the privacy and dignity of third \\nparties; I have concluded that the applicant has established that the records are likely relevant and \\nthat their production to the court is necessary in the interests of justice. \\n \\nV. \\nDISPOSITION \\n \\n[67] \\nStage One of Mr. Lahens’s production application is allowed. The records at issue will be \\nproduced to the court for review. The matter will proceed to Stage Two. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1948 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nJ. R.

Hooper – Lawyer for the Plaintiffs/Responding Parties \\n \\nM. Veneziano – Lawyer for Dr. James David Rogers and Dr. Paul Edward Faulkner, \\nDefendants/Moving Parties \\nHEARD: \\nMarch 26, 2024 \\nENDORSEMENT \\n \\n[1] \\nThe Defendants, Dr. James Rogers and Dr. Paul Faulkner (“the Defendant Physicians”), bring \\nthis motion for an extension of time for the service of three expert reports pursuant to Rule 53.03(4) \\nof the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  \\n \\n[2] \\nThe Plaintiffs oppose the motion and seek to exclude the reports at trial because of the late \\nservice.  \\n \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\n[3] \\nThis claim arises from alleged medical negligence that occurred during a laparoscopic \\ncholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) performed on the late Michael Quinn on October 31, 2017 \\nand a follow-up visit in November 2017. The statement of claim was issued in the action on January \\n9, 2020. \\n \\n[4] \\nThe matter was set down for trial on January 31, 2023. It is scheduled to proceed to a jury \\ntrial commencing May 13, 2024, for an estimated 12-15 days. \\n \\n[5] \\nA timetable, including for the exchange of expert reports, had been agreed to by the parties. \\n  \\n2024 ONSC 1967 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 2 of 7 \\n \\n[6] \\nThe Plaintiffs delivered their liability and damages expert reports by July 12, 2023. According \\nto the timetable, the Defendant Physicians’ expert reports were due by October 31, 2023.  \\n \\n[7] \\nGiven that the pre-trial conference was scheduled for March 4, 2024, the Rules of Civil \\nProcedure required that the Defendant Physicians’ expert reports be served at least 60 days before \\nthe conference, so by January 4, 2024.  \\n \\n[8] \\nOn January 23, 2024, the Defendant Physicians served three responding expert reports, being: \\n(i) an expert report of emergency physician Dr. A. Shah commenting on treatment and care, dated \\nDecember 22, 2023; (ii) an expert report of general surgeon Dr. A. Davison commenting on treatment \\nand care, dated January 14, 2024; and (iii) an expert report of economist Dr. D. Hyatt commenting \\non the Plaintiffs’ economic loss claim, dated December 20, 2023.  \\n \\n[9] \\nOn January 25, 2024, counsel for the Plaintiffs wrote to counsel for the Defendant Physicians \\nindicating that the pre-trial conference was on March 4, 2024 and the expert reports were served 19 \\ndays late, pursuant to the Rules. He indicated that he would be seeking to exclude the expert reports \\nat the trial. \\n \\n[10] \\nOn January 29, 2024, counsel for the Plaintiffs and for the Defendant Physicians had a \\ntelephone call. The Defendant Physicians’ counsel explained that the expert reports were served late \\ndue to inadvertence, as she had believed that the pre-trial conference was scheduled for the end of \\nMarch 2024. She advised that the Plaintiffs could take as much time as was needed for any reply \\nexpert reports, and expressed that the Plaintiffs have not suffered any prejudice as a result. \\n \\n[11] \\nOn March 4, 2024, the parties attended the pre-trial conference. The pre-trial conference \\nJudge directed that the Defendant Physicians bring a motion respecting an extension of time for \\nservice under the Rules. \\nISSUE \\n[12] \\nThe issue to be determined is whether the court should extend the time for service of the \\nDefendant Physicians’ three expert reports. \\nANALYSIS \\n[13] \\nRule 53.03(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a party who intends on calling an \\nexpert witness at trial shall, not less than 90 days before the pre-trial conference, serve an expert \\nreport; and Rule 53.03(2) provides that any responding expert report must be served no less than 60 \\ndays before the pre-trial conference. \\n \\n[14] \\nPursuant to Rule 53.03(3) experts cannot testify at trial without leave if their report is not filed \\nin accordance with the Rules.  \\n \\n[15] \\nRule 53.03(4) provides that a party may seek an extension of time for service of an expert \\nreport on consent, at the pre-trial conference, or on a motion before the court. The applicable test \\nunder such a motion is found in Rule 53.08. \\n2024 ONSC 1967 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 3 of 7 \\n \\n[16] \\nWhere there has been a failure to comply with the requirements regarding experts’ reports, in \\ndetermining whether leave to admit the evidence should be granted, Rule 53.08(1) provides that the \\nparty seeking leave must satisfy the judge that: \\n \\n(a) \\nthere is a reasonable explanation for the failure; and \\n \\n(b) \\ngranting leave would not, \\n \\n(i) \\ncause prejudice to the opposing party that could not be compensated for by costs \\nor an adjournment, or \\n \\n(ii) \\ncause undue delay in the conduct of the trial. \\n \\nReasonable explanation for the late service \\n \\nPosition of the Plaintiffs \\n \\n[17] \\nThe Plaintiffs submit inadvertence is not an excuse commonly found outside of cases in which \\ncounsel miss limitation dates and the prejudice to the parties is the entirety of their claim. Here, there \\nis little more than a bare assertion of inadvertence. This is not sufficient. No reasonable explanation \\nhas been provided for the late service.  \\n \\n[18] \\nThe Plaintiffs argue that counsel for the Defendant Physicians intended to serve the expert \\nreports at the last possible moment, as a strategic move, and they were essentially caught out by the \\nerror in timing. This was not an innocent mistake and so it should not be relieved against by the \\ngranting of an extension of time. The Plaintiffs note that, not only were the expert reports not served \\nat least 60 days before the pre-trial conference, they were not served – or even obtained – by October \\n31, 2023, which had been the agreed upon date set out in the parties’ timetable.  \\n \\nDiscussion \\n \\n[19] \\nIn support of their motion, the Defendant Physicians filed an affidavit sworn by the lawyer \\nwho admits responsibility for missing the delivery deadline for the expert reports. The lawyer attests, \\nat paragraphs 14 and 15 of their affidavit: \\n \\n14. \\nThe Impugned Expert Reports were served on January 23, 2024, 41 days before \\nthe pre-trial conference instead of 60 days before the pre-trial conference, by \\ninadvertence. I mistakenly believed that the pre-trial conference was at the end of March \\n2024 and that our expert reports were accordingly due at the end of January 2024.  \\n \\n15. \\nThe reports from Dr. Shah and Dr. Hyatt were finalized by December 22, 2023, \\nwithin the timelines prescribed by the Rules of Civil Procedure. I expected to finalize \\nthe third expert report of Dr. Davison shortly thereafter, and I did not believe our reports \\nwere due until the end of January, so I did not serve those two reports at that time. \\n \\n[20] \\nThe affiant was not cross-examined on the affidavit and so their evidence in this regard is \\nuncontroverted.   \\n2024 ONSC 1967 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 4 of 7 \\n \\n[21] \\nThe Plaintiffs cite Agha v. Munroe, 2022 ONSC 2508, in support of their position that an \\nextension of time should not be granted. In that case, during preliminary discussions with counsel \\nafter the jury had been selected, the trial judge was informed that the plaintiff did not have any expert \\nreports addressing the issue of past and future income loss or past and future medical rehabilitation \\nneeds. The reason given was that the plaintiff could not afford to engage experts to prepare such \\nreports. Soon thereafter, plaintiff’s counsel advised the trial judge that he had spoken to “unnamed \\nexperts” who indicated they could provide him with reports “some time” during the following week. \\nCounsel for the defendants strongly opposed any late delivery of such expert reports, indicating that \\nhe would not have an opportunity to obtain responding reports, thus resulting in a potential mistrial \\nand/or adjournment of the trial. The trial judge ruled that he would not grant leave for late service of \\nthe expert reports because it would have had the “inevitable result of having to adjourn the trial for \\nsome considerable period of time” to allow the defence to obtain responding reports and a jury had \\nalready been empaneled and told the trial would be completed within a two-to-three-week period. \\nThe resulting delay “would have been completely unfair to the jury” and caused an undue delay in \\nthe conduct of the trial. \\n \\n[22] \\nI find Agha to be distinguishable from the case before me. In Agha, the explanation provided \\nby the plaintiff’s counsel for not having served expert reports was because the cost of obtaining those \\nreports was prohibitive; and the request for leave for late service was made after the trial had begun \\nand related to expert reports that had not yet been prepared. A decision not to obtain expert reports \\nprior to trial is deliberate and is not the same thing as an inadvertent mistake in a delivery deadline. \\nFurther, in Agha, the time needed to obtain and serve the reports was effectively unknown. Here, the \\nreports were served some months ago and the Plaintiffs have had them in hand since that time, which \\nis in keeping with the purpose of the Rules to ensure that parties have reasonable notice of expert \\nopinions. \\n \\n[23] \\nThe Plaintiffs also rely on the decision in Tyner v. Phillips, 2023 ONSC 5207. In that case, in \\nthe months leading up to a four-week jury trial, the defendants made a motion to compel the plaintiff \\nto attend three separate defence medical examinations. The motion was opposed by the plaintiff due \\nto non-compliance by the defendants with the timelines set out in the Rules and a consent order setting \\nout the timing for delivery of expert reports. The motion judge held that she would not compel the \\nplaintiff to undergo three separate defence medical examinations “when the reports that will arise \\nfrom those examinations are presumptively inadmissible at trial. This is particularly so due to the \\nabsence of evidence of a reasonable explanation for the delay.” I find that Tyner is distinguishable \\nfrom the case before me. Here, the three expert reports are already served, there is no examination \\nrequired of the Plaintiffs and no time lag as there would have been in Tyner. \\n \\n[24] \\nThe explanation given by the Defendant Physicians’ lawyer for missing the delivery deadline \\nis sparse and no real context or details were provided. Nonetheless, I accept the affidavit evidence \\nand find that the failure to deliver the three expert reports at least 60 days before the pre-trial \\nconference was due to an inadvertent mistake. \\n \\n[25] \\nA lawyer’s inadvertence in meeting a deadline required by the Rules can constitute a \\n“reasonable explanation” for a failure to meet the deadline: see Noori v. Grewal, [2011] O.J. No. \\n4190 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 26, citing Nugent v. Crook (1969), 40 O.R. (2d) 110 (Ont. C.A.), at \\npara.111; Purkis v. 736007 Ontario Ltd., [2001] O.J. No. 324 (Ont. Div. Ct.); and Tarsitano v. Drutz, \\n2013 ONSC 5605, at par. 32; aff’d 2014 ONCA 351. \\n2024 ONSC 1967 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 5 of 7 \\n \\n[26] \\nIt is a fact of life that mistakes can happen to us all. Sometimes, mere inadvertence is the sole \\ncause of a mistake. \\n \\n[27] \\nThere is no evidentiary basis upon which to find that the delivery of the Defendant Physicians’ \\nexpert reports to the Plaintiffs was strategically timed in order to gain some unfair advantage, as \\nasserted by the Plaintiffs. However, to the extent that there is any truth to that assertion, I note the \\ncomments of Dubin J.A. in Foulis et al. v. Robinson; Gore Mutual Ins. Co., Third Party (1978), 21 \\nO.R. (2d) 769 (C.A.), wherein the defendant and third party appealed from the award of costs against \\nthem on the scale as between solicitor and his own client following their unsuccessful defence of the \\naction. It was the view of the learned trial Judge that there was really no defence to the action and so \\nhe had disapproved of the conduct of the defendant and the third party. On the appeal, in holding that \\nthe trial judge had erred in awarding costs on a higher scale, Dubin J.A. stated at page 776: \\n \\nThere is a great danger, in my respectful opinion, in a trial Judge second-guessing, after \\nthe event, how a trial should be conducted, even where the trial is presided over, as was \\nthe case here, by a trial Judge who has had great trial experience at the bar. \\n \\n[28] \\nI agree with Dubin J.A.’s statement that a judge generally should not “second guess” the steps \\ntaken by a defendant as it relates to the conduct of an action. Although the Defendant Physicians \\nfailed to comply with the agreed-upon timetable for delivery of their expert reports and they intended \\non serving those reports only 60 days before the pre-trial conference, there was no evidence that this \\nwas to harass the Plaintiffs or abuse the process. I do not find this conduct to be egregious or that it \\nwarrants a refusal to grant leave. \\n \\n[29] \\nIn the circumstances, I am satisfied that a reasonable explanation has been provided for the \\nfailure to meet the deadline for delivery of the Defendant Physicians’ expert reports. \\n \\nAny prejudice or undue delay \\n \\nPosition of the Plaintiffs \\n \\n[30] \\nThe Plaintiffs submit that, if an extension of time for service of the three expert reports is \\ngranted, the prejudice to them will be substantial and serious. Their counsel has made trial \\npreparations on the assumption there would be no liability dispute at trial. In the view of the Plaintiffs, \\na trial proceeding without liability, as has been expected, would be five days in length and save \\nsignificant judicial resources and legal expense. Should relief be granted on this motion, there will \\nnot only be substantial changes to the Plaintiffs’ preparation now, but also in the future if they are \\nable to obtain a reply report.  \\n \\n[31] \\nWhile the Defendant Physicians have offered to admit any reply report up to a week prior to \\ntrial, this also presents a prejudice to the Plaintiffs in that they need to finalize their trial strategy and \\npreparation within an extremely short period of time. The Plaintiffs should have had the advantage \\nof a reply report at the pre-trial conference, which may have led to favourable conditions for a \\nsettlement. It is now impossible to know if the matter could have settled earlier. The hearing of this \\nmotion is less than two months from the start date of the trial. An adjournment could cause a lengthy \\ndelay of the trial of the action in light of scheduling realities and of counsel’s availability, which \\ndelay would also significantly prejudice the Plaintiffs. \\n2024 ONSC 1967 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 6 of 7 \\n \\nDiscussion \\n \\n[32] \\nPrejudice will depend on the circumstances of each case and the stage of the proceedings. \\n \\n[33] \\nHere, the late expert reports were served 19 days late and 41 days prior to the pre-trial \\nconference. \\n \\n[34] \\nThe Defendant Physicians’ expert reports were served on January 23, 2024, and so they will \\nhave been in the hands of the Plaintiffs just over 3.5 months by the commencement of the trial in \\nmid-May. Although late, the delivery in January 2024 still allowed for the obtaining of legal advice \\nand possible opinion evidence to answer the reports. While it is assumed that the Plaintiffs will want \\nto prepare a reply expert report, there was no evidence before me regarding the need to do so nor, \\nmore importantly, was there any evidence filed by the Plaintiffs that it would not be possible to obtain \\na reply expert report in time for use at the trial.  \\n \\n[35] \\nWith respect to the Plaintiffs’ argument that they will suffer prejudice due to the fact that their \\ncounsel has made trial preparations on the assumption there would be no liability dispute at trial, I \\nam not persuaded by that. The Trial Management Report that was finalized at the pre-trial conference \\non March 4, 2024, shows three references to both “liability and damages” being issues at the trial of \\nthis matter. Before me, counsel for the Defendant Physicians advised that liability has not been \\nadmitted. Therefore, liability is a live issue at the trial. It is not prejudice for a plaintiff to have to \\nfully prove their case at trial. In any event, to the extent the Plaintiffs’ trial preparations must change \\nif leave is granted, that is a prejudice that can be compensated for by costs or an adjournment. \\n  \\n[36] \\nIn balancing the potential prejudice to each of the parties, in my view, it is the Defendant \\nPhysicians who would suffer the greater prejudice if the requested time extension was not granted. \\nThis is a medical negligence case and the impugned reports address liability and damages. Counsel \\nsubmits that they are the only expert reports the Defendant Physicians intend to deliver. I find that if \\nthe reports are excluded, evidence that is relevant and material to the defence will not be before the \\ntrier of fact, and the resulting prejudice to the Defendant Physicians will be significant. \\n \\n[37] \\nBased on the foregoing, I am satisfied that granting leave would not cause prejudice to the \\nPlaintiffs that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment and would not cause undue \\ndelay in the conduct of the trial. \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n[38] \\nIn the result, the Defendant Physicians’ motion is granted and, as requested, the time for \\nservice of the expert reports of Dr. A. Shah dated December 22, 2023, Dr. A. Davison dated January \\n14, 2024, and Dr. D. Hyatt dated December 20, 2023, is hereby extended to January 23, 2024. \\n \\n[39] \\nThe Plaintiffs are granted leave to file a reply report(s), if any, and that reply report(s) should \\nbe served as soon as it is available, but in any event no less than 48 hours before the trial is to \\ncommence or as otherwise ordered by a court. \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1967 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 7 of 7 \\n \\nCOSTS \\n[40] \\nWhile the Defendant Physicians have been the successful parties on this motion, given that it \\nwas their expert reports that were served late and given that the relief granted is for their benefit \\nalone, I am not inclined to award them any costs.  \\n \\n[41] \\nHowever, I did not hear from counsel on the issue of costs at the hearing. So, if the parties are \\nunable to agree on costs and wish to make costs submissions, they may be made as follows: \\n \\n(a) \\nBy April 24th, 2024, the Defendant Physicians shall serve and file their written costs \\nsubmissions, not to exceed three pages, double-spaced, together with a draft bill of costs \\nand copies of any pertinent offers; and \\n \\n(b) \\nThe Plaintiffs shall serve and file their responding costs submissions of no more than \\nthree pages, double-spaced, together with a draft bill of costs and copies of any pertinent \\noffers, by May 8th, 2024; and \\n \\n(c) \\nThe Defendant Physicians’ reply submissions, if any, are to be served and filed by May \\n15th, 2024 and are not to exceed two pages. \\n \\n(d) \\nIf no submissions are received by May 15th, 2024, the parties will be deemed to have \\nresolved the issue of costs, and costs will not be determined by me. \\n \\n \\n__________________________ \\nMacNEIL J. \\nReleased: \\nApril 3, 2024 \\n2024 ONSC 1967 (CanLII)\\n',\n",

In the alternative, Jan moves for summary judgment \\ndismissing the Plaintiff’s claim under r. 20. In the further alternative, the Defendant asserts \\nthat any cause of action is statute barred by the applicable limitation period.  \\n[2] \\nThe Plaintiff has discontinued his claim against the Defendants Canada Life Assurance \\nCompany (“Canada Life”) and Aga Khan Foundation Canada (“the Foundation”). This \\nleaves only his claim against Jan now limited to damages for misrepresentation. \\nBackground  \\n2024 ONSC 1912 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n[3] \\nWith the assistance of Jan, the Plaintiff obtained a Canada Life ‘Millennium Universal \\nLife’ policy (“the policy”) in August 2001. The policy insured the life of the plaintiff to \\nage 100 and carried a death benefit of $250,000. The Plaintiff wished to name the \\nFoundation as the beneficiary of the policy. This required that the Foundation own the \\npolicy.  \\n[4] \\nThe Plaintiff duly executed a delivery receipt on August 23, 2021, followed by a “Title \\nChange Form” on August 24, 2021, which had the effect of transferring both ownership of \\nand any rights and interests under the policy to the Foundation.  \\n[5] \\nThe Plaintiff agreed to pay a monthly premium of $1,154.34 to fund the policy. That \\namount was adjusted shortly thereafter to $1,215.00 per month (“the base premium”). The \\nPlaintiff did not object to payment of the base premium.  The Plaintiff calculates that he \\nhad paid total premiums of $295,245.00 as of October 2021. The Plaintiff continues to pay \\nthe base premium.  \\n[6] \\nAt some unspecified point, the premium payable to maintain the policy increased to $3,215 \\nper month (“the adjusted premium”).  According to the Plaintiff, Jan first divulged this \\ndetail in December 2020, when he admitted that there had been a “grave error” on his part \\nand that unless the adjusted premium was paid, the policy would be cancelled without any \\nrefund of premium. The difference between the base premium and the adjusted premium \\nis referred to as the “premium differential”. \\n[7] \\nFor an unspecified time, the premium differential was paid out of the accumulated cash \\nvalue of the policy.  Since approximately February 2021, the premium differential has been \\npaid by Jan, his company, or Canada Life.   As a result, the policy remains in good standing.  \\nThe Position of the Defendant  \\n[8] \\nJan argues that the Plaintiff’s should be dismissed under both rules. The claim has no legal \\nfoundation. The Plaintiff lacks standing to maintain it. The Plaintiff is not the owner of the \\npolicy and has no legal or insurable interest in it. Nor was there any no misrepresentation \\non Jan’s part - the Plaintiff admits that he agreed to purchase the policy and pay the base \\npremium. The policy remains in good standing. The death benefit of $250,000 will be paid \\nto the Foundation upon the Plaintiff’s death.  Any illustration of how the policy might work \\nwas just that; there was no representation that the Plaintiff relied upon to his detriment. In \\nany event, the Plaintiff has not sustained any damages.  \\n[9] \\nThe Plaintiff can make no claim to any cash value in the policy. The cash value can only \\nbe used: a) as collateral for a loan; b) to pay premiums due, or premium shortfalls, or c) to \\ntake a cash loan from the policy itself. The Plaintiff has no right to access the cash value \\nof the policy. The cash value has no bearing on the death benefit. \\nThe Position of the Plaintiff  \\n[10] \\nThe Plaintiff contends that Jan misrepresented the terms of the policy and specifically the \\nfact that the base premium would never increase. From the outset, the Plaintiff made it \\n2024 ONSC 1912 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nclear to Jan that the base premium was never to exceed the amounts he received from his \\nCanada and Old Age Security pensions.  \\n[11] \\nThe Plaintiff contends that he would never have purchased the policy had Jan made \\ndivulged that the base premium might increase over the policy term. Again, according to \\nthe Plaintiff, he was required to pay the adjusted premium for a period of two months before \\na “solution” was arrived at whereby the Plaintiff would revert to paying only the base \\npremium. \\n[12] \\nThe Plaintiff then learned that Canada Life had been making up the difference between the \\nadjusted premium of $3,215 and the base premium of $1,215 (a difference of nearly $2,000 \\nper month!) by drawing it from the cash value of the policy. With the cash value having \\nbeen depleted by December 2020, Jan was obliged to reveal to the Plaintiff for the first \\ntime that the adjusted premium would now have to be paid without access to the cash \\navailable in the policy.  \\n[13] \\nThere appears to be an arrangement in place whereby Jan, his company, or Canada Life \\nmonitor the status of the policy each month and either Jan or his company pay the premium \\ndifferential, thereby maintaining the policy in good standing. \\nRule 21.01(1)(b)  \\n[14] \\nThe applicable part of this rule reads as follows: \\n \\n21.01 (1) A party may move before a judge,  \\n \\n(b) to strike out a pleading on the ground that it discloses no \\nreasonable cause of action or defence \\n \\nand the judge may make an order or grant judgment accordingly. \\n  \\n  \\n(2) No evidence is admissible on a motion, \\n \\n(b) under clause (1)(b) \\nAnalysis (I): The Plain and Obvious Test \\n[15] \\n The test to apply under r. 21.01(1)(b) is the “plain and obvious test”.   It has been accurately \\ndescribed in Dawson v. Baker, 2017 ONSC 6477, [2017] O.J. No. 5617, at para. 46: \\nThe “plain and obvious test” under Rule 21.01(1)(b) sets out a low \\nthreshold. The court considers whether the necessary elements of a \\ncause of action are pleaded, assuming the facts as alleged are true. \\nConsequently, if the allegations do not give rise to a recognized \\ncause of action or if the claim fails to plead the necessary elements \\nof an otherwise recognized cause of action, it will be struck under \\nRule 21.01(1)(b). \\n2024 ONSC 1912 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n \\n[16] \\nI would not strike the pleading as disclosing no cause of action. It is far from plain and \\nobvious that the claim could not succeed. I cannot agree with the Defendant that the \\nPlaintiff lacks the legal standing to bring the claim. That is undoubtedly true as it pertains \\nto any claim against Canada Life or for any relief under the policy – he lacks the legal \\nstanding to sue under the policy because he is neither the owner nor the beneficiary.  \\n[17] \\nThe claim for misrepresentation is, however, entirely different. As the purchaser of a good \\nor service (the policy) and as payor of the premium, the Plaintiff stood in a relationship \\nwith the Defendant which did not depend on the Plaintiff’s standing to bring an action \\nunder the policy. The claim for misrepresentation arises from the circumstances \\nsurrounding the purchase of the policy, the inducements and representations made by the \\nDefendant, and the reliance placed upon them by the Plaintiff. The wording and workings \\nof the policy, and in particular, the amount of premium that would be required to maintain \\nthe policy over its term, form part of the evidence in support of that claim.   \\n[18] \\nOne initial concern with the claim for misrepresentation, however, is the absence of any \\nclassification of the kind of misrepresentation being alleged (i.e., whether it is fraudulent, \\nnegligent, or innocent).  \\n[19] \\nThe Defendant did not make an issue of the failure of the Plaintiff to specify the class of \\nmisrepresentation he is alleging. Regarding fraudulent misrepresentation, there is a general \\nrule that allegations of fraud must be strictly pleaded and strictly proved, see: Toronto \\nDominion Bank v. Leigh Instruments Ltd (Trustee of), [1998] O.J. No. 4221 (Gen. Div.) at \\npara. 18. Still there is appellate authority to support the proposition that even if the word \\n“fraudulent” is not contained in the pleading, it may be clear from the context what the \\nPlaintiff is alleging and it is proper for a motion judge to view the entire pleading in context: \\nsee Shoppers Drug Mart Inc. v. 6470360 Canada Inc. (cob Energyshop Consulting Inc./ \\nPowerhouse Energy Management Inc.), [2014] O.J. No. 476, 2014 ONCA 85, at paras. 54 \\nand 63. The Alberta Court of Appeal held similarly in 581257 Alberta Ltd. v. Aujla, [2013] \\nA.J. No. 21 at para. 38, when it determined that it was sufficient if the statement of claim \\nset out allegations which if proven, would amount to fraud.  \\n[20] \\nBy analogy, I would apply that reasoning here: although the class of misrepresentation is \\nnot specifically pleaded, a generous reading of the pleading satisfies me that it sets out \\nallegations, which if proven, would meet the test for negligent misrepresentation.  \\n[21] \\nIn the case of Queen v. Cognos Inc., [1993] 1 S.C.R. 87 at para. 33, the court outlined five \\ngeneral requirements for imposing liability for negligent misrepresentation: \\n(1) there must be a duty of care based on a special relationship \\nbetween the representor and the representee; (2) the representation \\nin question must be untrue, inaccurate, or misleading; (3) the \\nrepresentor must have acted negligently in making said \\nrepresentation; (4) the representee must have relied, in a reasonable \\nmanner, on said negligent misrepresentation; and (5) the reliance \\n2024 ONSC 1912 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nmust have been detrimental to the representee in the sense that \\ndamages resulted. \\n  \\n[22] \\nIt is not plain and obvious on the pleading that the Plaintiff could not succeed in a claim \\nfor negligent misrepresentation. The constituent elements of that tort are contained in the \\npleading. The relationship between the parties is described adequately; the background and \\nnarrative leading to the purchase of the policy are set out including the recommendations, \\nomissions, and explanations of the Defendant; the reliance and trust the Plaintiff placed on \\nthe Jan’s advice is described along with the nature of the alleged misrepresentations and \\ntheir aftermath. The Plaintiff claims that he sustained damages as a result.  \\n[23] \\nRead generously, this poorly drafted and rather clumsy claim discloses a cause of action \\nwhich sounds in misrepresentation to wit: the Defendant in the capacity of an agent induced \\nthe Plaintiff to purchase the policy based upon certain information, assurances and \\nexplanations offered by the Defendant some of which proved not to be true (i.e., the base \\npremium payable would not increase). The Plaintiff relied on the representations made by \\nthe Defendant to his detriment. Had he known the truth, he would not have purchased the \\npolicy. There is a direct correlation between the acts and omissions of the Defendant, the \\nactions taken by the Plaintiff as a result.  Read as a whole, and despite its meandering style, \\nthe document does contain the constituent elements of misrepresentation sufficient to \\nsustain it as a pleading. The claim might better have been advanced as one for breach of \\nfiduciary duty; nonetheless, misrepresentation is a distinct and recognizable tort which has \\nbeen adequately pleaded.  \\n[24] \\nThe Plaintiff seeks an order that the policy is void and terminated. That is clearly not an \\navailable remedy since the parties to the contract are the Foundation and Canada Life. But \\nthe Plaintiff also seeks damages from Jan for the premiums paid under the policy since its \\ninception. While damages are highly unlikely to be awarded on that basis, that does not \\npreclude Plaintiff from seeking damages on some basis for a quantum to be proven and \\ndetermined. Indeed, an appropriate remedy for misrepresentation would be damages.  It is \\nnot plain and obvious that the Plaintiff would not be awarded damages if the Defendant \\nwere found to have committed the tort of misrepresentation.  \\nAnalysis (II): Are There Genuine Issues Requiring a Trial? \\n[25] \\nRule 20 permits a Defendant to move for summary judgment with supporting affidavit or \\nother evidence following delivery of a Statement of Defence. \\n[26] \\nIn response to affidavit material or other evidence supporting a motion for summary \\njudgment, a responding party may not rest solely on the allegations or denials in the party’s \\npleadings but must set out, in affidavit material or other evidence, specific facts showing \\nthat there is a genuine issue requiring a trial.  \\n[27] \\nThe court shall grant summary judgment if it is satisfied that there is no genuine issue \\nrequiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence. In determining whether there is a \\ngenuine issue requiring a trial, the court shall consider the evidence submitted by the parties \\n2024 ONSC 1912 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nand a judge may weigh the evidence, evaluate the credibility of a deponent and draw \\nreasonable inferences from the evidence unless it is in the interest of justice for such powers \\nto be exercised only at trial. \\n[28] \\nI agree with the Defendant that there is no genuine issue as to whether the Plaintiff is \\nentitled to be repaid the base premiums paid for the policy. This would be tantamount to a \\nvoiding of the policy as if coverage had never been afforded or a death benefit could never \\nhave been paid. This is a wholly untenable damages claim.  \\n[29] \\nThe Plaintiff’s alternative claim for damages for what would have been the cash value of \\nthe policy had it not been depleted has its own problems. First, as neither the owner nor the \\nbeneficiary of the policy, the Plaintiff would have no direct entitlement to the cash value \\nof the policy. Second, there is presently no basis upon which the court can calculate what \\nthe cash value of the policy would be had it not been used for payment of the policy \\ndifferential. The Plaintiff has failed to provide any calculation in that regard. Third, to the \\nextent that the Plaintiff could benefit from the cash value of the policy, he could do so only \\nindirectly and contingently: it could be used to pay a shortfall in premium prompted by the \\nPlaintiff’s failure to make a payment. But that has not happened.  \\n[30] \\nThe Defendant argues that at best, the Plaintiff’s claim for misrepresentation is premature \\nbecause he has suffered no calculable or compensable damage. He has continued to pay \\nthe obligatory base premium to maintain the policy in good standing. The policy has been \\nmaintained by payment of the policy differential, first by Canada Life, then by Jan. In that \\nway, the Plaintiff has received exactly what he bargained for: in return for his payment of \\nthe base premium, Canada Life is obliged to pay the death benefit. The Plaintiff’s argument \\nthat had he known that the policy scenario painted by Jan was not accurate he would not \\nhave purchased the policy cannot be maintained. Finally, the Plaintiff cannot recover \\ndamages based on the premiums he has paid since 2001.  \\n[31] \\nThus, the Defendant contends that if there was a misrepresentation, it has not resulted in \\nany damages. It would be tortious conduct without accompanying damages. This results in \\nthere being no genuine issue requiring a trial.  \\n[32] \\nI disagree. \\n[33] \\nThere most certainly remains a genuine issue as to whether Jan misrepresented the nature \\nof the policy and how it would operate. Specifically, there remains a question as to whether \\nJan misrepresented the nature and workings of the policy, the meaning and purpose of cash \\nvalue, whether the base premiums would remain constant or would increase, and whether \\nthe Plaintiff relied on the misrepresentations to his detriment. These issues will require \\ncourt scrutiny of evidence pertaining to discussions and events from several decades ago. \\nAssessing the credibility of the witnesses and the reliability of their evidence will be crucial \\nfor adjudication.  If there was misrepresentation, the court would then consider a remedy.  \\n[34] \\nAs the contracting party, the Plaintiff retained a direct interest in the amount of the base \\npremium that would be required to fund the policy. As well, the Plaintiff retained an \\n2024 ONSC 1912 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nindirect interest in the cash value of the policy since it could be available to pay any \\npremium shortfall or premium due.  \\n[35] \\nI do not accept the Defendant’s submission that the claim for any loss is premature. There \\nis a genuine issue as to whether a policy with a fixed and static base premium is equivalent \\nto a policy subject to premium increases.  The seemingly ad hoc and unwritten arrangement \\nwhereby Jan, his company or Canada Life pay the premium differential will certainly be a \\npiece of evidence for the court to consider; but it would not in itself be the answer to the \\nquestion of whether the Plaintiff got what he bargained for or whether he has suffered any \\ndamages.   \\n[36] \\nWhat would happen, for example, if Jan’s situation changed, if he died, became \\nincapacitated, declared bankruptcy? Would he continue to be able, let alone inclined or \\nobligated, to pay the premium differential to keep the policy in good standing? And what \\nmotivation would Canada Life have to pay the premium differential? None. Canada Life \\nhas no contractual obligation to do so; and likely no financial one either.  It has received a \\ncombination of a base and adjusted premium for several decades now. Should the adjusted \\npremium not be paid, the policy would lapse without refund and the company would be \\nrelieved of its obligation to pay the death benefit.  \\n[37] \\nIf a court were to accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that he would not have purchased the \\npolicy had he been advised that there would be a premium increase during the policy term, \\nhow could the Plaintiff not be entitled to some remedy in damages, however nominal? \\n[38] \\nIn terms of damages, there is uncontradicted evidence that the Plaintiff was obliged to pay \\nthe entire adjusted premium for the two months, December 2020, and January 2021.  This \\nrepresents $4,000 more than the Plaintiff intended to pay under the policy; as modest a sum \\nas this might me, it still could form the basis of a damages award should the court find that \\nJan made a misrepresentation.  \\n[39] \\nAlternatively, the depletion of the policy’s cash value to pay the enhanced premium could \\nbe viewed as a loss of an indirect benefit to the Plaintiff, since that cash value would have \\nkept the policy in good standing had the Plaintiff chosen to take a premium holiday.  \\nIndeed, that option is no longer open to him.  This too could form the basis of a damages \\naward.    \\n[40] \\nI was referred to no authority for the proposition that because a person has no insurable \\ninterest or ownership rights in a policy, that person would be precluded from bringing a \\nclaim for misrepresentation against the person through whom she purchased that policy. \\n[41] \\nIn my view, the fact that the Plaintiff has failed to quantify his damages is not fatal to his \\nability to seek damages. The court has a wide discretion in how it compensates a wronged \\nPlaintiff.  It is up to the trier of fact to quantify and award damages based upon the evidence \\nand the law of damages. I am not persuaded that there is no basis for an award of damages \\nto the Plaintiff.  \\n2024 ONSC 1912 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\n[42] \\nThis is not a motion to strike or dismiss a claim for a failure to provide particulars, for \\nfailure to fulfill an undertaking or to refuse to answer a proper question on discovery. Nor \\nis the question before the court whether the method for calculation of damages proposed \\nby the Plaintiff will be adopted by the court.  \\n[43] \\nI am not able to reach a fair and just determination on the merits by way of a summary \\njudgment motion. Conclusions of fact will require credibility findings and weighing of \\nevidence. The law of misrepresentation can only be applied to the facts as they are found. \\nThe question of damages, if any, cannot be determined without findings of fact. I cannot \\nsay that summary judgment is a more proportionate, expeditious and less expensive means \\nto achieve a just result in this case. \\nThe Limitation Period   \\n[44] \\nThe moving party spent little to no time arguing that the Plaintiff’s claim was statute barred. \\nIt is not pleaded in its statement of defence. The issue is not raised in its factum. Regardless, \\nthe Plaintiff alleges that he first received notice of the premium differential in December \\n2020. The claim was issued in November 2021, well within the applicable limitation period \\nof two years after which the Plaintiff discovered the alleged misrepresentation. On the \\nevidentiary record before me, there is no basis to dismiss the action for being out of time. \\nSummary and Disposition   \\n[45] \\nFor the foregoing reasons, I find that it is not plain and obvious that the claim cannot \\nsucceed. The motion under r. 21.01(b) is dismissed.  \\n[46] \\n I am not persuaded that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. The question of whether \\nJan misrepresented the nature and details of the policy is very much a triable issue, partly \\nto be determined by an assessment and weighing of viva voce evidence. The twin questions \\nof whether the Plaintiff suffered any damages from that misrepresentation and how those \\ndamages can be quantified are also genuine issues requiring a trial. The motion for \\nsummary judgment is therefore dismissed.  \\n[47] \\nFinally, there is no basis in the evidence for a finding that the claim is barred by any \\nlimitation period. That aspect of the motion is also dismissed. \\n[48] \\nIf the parties are unable to agree on the issue of costs, they make take out an appointment \\nto address that issue before me through the trial coordinator at the Newmarket Superior \\nCourt of Justice. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMcCarthy, J.  \\n2024 ONSC 1912 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\n \\nReleased: April 2, 2024 \\n2024 ONSC 1912 (CanLII)\\n',\n",

However, the plaintiffs received limited assistance under the \\nCrown’s program and remain dissatisfied with the amount of the payments made to them. \\n[4] \\nThe plaintiffs’ claim sounds in negligence. The plaintiffs allege that the program was \\ndesigned negligently because its payment formula relied on “allowable net sales” (“ANS”) \\ndata from 2000-2004 that was “out-of-date” and taken from past government subsidy \\nprograms and did not reflect their circumstances in 2007-2008. The plaintiffs’ farming \\noperations had changed between 2000-2004 and 2007-2008, such that, the program’s use \\nof the 2000-2004 ANS data resulted in the plaintiffs receiving smaller subsidy payments \\nthat did not address their needs at the time of the program. The plaintiffs allege that it was \\nnegligent for the Crown’s program to rely on the out-of-date data.  \\n[5] \\nThe central issue on the motion for summary judgment is whether the decision in question \\nwas an operational or policy decision.  \\n[6] \\nThe position of the moving party Crown is that the design of a payment formula for a \\nsubsidy program is squarely a core government policy decision, and such policy decisions \\nare immune from tort liability under the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, 20192 and \\nat common law. \\n[7] \\nThe position of the responding party plaintiffs is that the decision to create a program to \\nassist hog farmers in response to financial hardships was a policy decision, that the decision \\nto allocate (ultimately) $139M to the program was a policy decision, but that the decision \\nto use the 2000-2004 ANS data to calculate the quantum of assistance a hog farmer would \\nreceive was an operational decision. \\n[8] \\nThe Crown also submits that the plaintiffs’ claim is barred by the applicable two-year \\nlimitation period under the Limitations Act, 2002.3 The Crown maintains that the plaintiffs \\ncommunicated with the Crown on numerous occasions as early as 2008, expressing their \\ndissatisfaction with the payment formula under the program, and they therefore discovered \\ntheir claim more than two years before commencing their action in 2016. \\n[9] \\nThe plaintiffs concede that there is no dispute that the program was administered in 2008, \\nthat the plaintiffs knew in 2008 that the program was based on the 2000-2004 ANS data, \\n                                                 \\n \\n1  Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. \\n2  Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, 2019, S.O. 2019, c. 7, Sched. 17. \\n3  Limitations Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nthat the plaintiffs challenged the program over an extended period beginning in 2008, and \\nthat this action was not commenced until 2016.  \\n[10] \\nHowever, the plaintiffs contend that plaintiffs did not discover their cause of action until \\n2014, when one of the plaintiffs obtained, through a freedom of information request, a copy \\nof the program’s payment guidelines, which guidelines indicated that the purpose of the \\nprogram was to assist hog farmers who were experiencing the effects of adverse economic \\npressures at the time of the program. The plaintiffs argue that this stated purpose was \\ncontrary to the Crown’s previously-known messaging, which was that the program was to \\naddress longstanding hurt within the hog industry. \\n[11] \\nFor the reasons that follow, I conclude that the Crown’s motion for summary dismissal \\nmust be allowed because there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. \\nFactual Background \\n[12] \\nWith few exceptions, there really is little dispute between the parties as to the chronology \\nof events here. The relevant facts are summarized in the Crown’s factum4 at paras. 14-43 \\nand in the plaintiffs’ factum5 at paras. 8-21. I highlight the following features of the factual \\nbackground. \\n[13] \\nThe plaintiffs are a group of (what was referred to in the materials as) “young producers” \\nor “young farmers” in the hog industry in Ontario.  \\n[14] \\nFor example, the plaintiff Ursula van den Heuvel O’Neil (“Ms. O’Neil”), who functioned \\nas the spokesperson for the plaintiffs’ group of young producers, and her husband, Mr. Will \\nO’Neil, operate a hog farm through their corporation, the plaintiff Mila Hills Swine Ltd. \\n(“Mila Hills”). Mila Hills was originally established in 1995 by Ms. O’Neil and her first \\nhusband, Mr. Michael van den Heuvel; however, after Mr. van den Heuvel passed away in \\n1998, Ms. O’Neil sold their farm in 2000. \\n[15] \\nIn March 2003, Ms. O’Neil and her second husband, Mr. O’Neil, decided to rent a farm \\nnearby, and they purchased the previous renter’s hogs and feed, which they continued to \\nrent until 2005. That operation was what is called a “farrow-to-wean” operation, meaning \\nthat they raised hogs only from when they were born until they were weaned and then sold \\nthem to other farmers who would raise them to market weight. \\n[16] \\nIn 2005, Ms. O’Neil and her husband purchased a farming business from another farmer \\n(Mr. Harry van Roessel) and took over his operation, which was a “farrow-to-finish” \\noperation, meaning that they raised hogs from when they were born until they are market \\nweight. \\n                                                 \\n \\n4  Factum of the Moving Party, His Majesty the King in right of Ontario signed July 14, 2023 (“Crown’s Factum”). \\n5  Responding Parties’ Factum signed July 28, 2023 (“Plaintiffs’ Factum”). \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n[17] \\nThe evidence of Ms. O’Neil was that when they purchased Mr. van Roessel’s operation in \\n2005, their expenses increased because, as she explained, not only is the amount of feed \\nrequired for a farrow-to-finish operation significantly greater than a farrow-to-wean \\noperation, but also their operation went from having about 110 sows (in the pre-2005 \\nfarrow-to-wean operation) to around 210 sows (in the post-2005 farrow-to-finish \\noperation). \\n[18] \\nIn or about 2007-2008, there were various federal and provincial business risk management \\nprograms in place for agriculture producers, including hog farmers, to protect them against \\nincome and production losses. \\n[19] \\nHowever, it is common ground that in 2007, the Ontario cattle, pork, and horticultural \\nsectors faced particular financial difficulties – indeed, a liquidity crisis – caused by \\nincreased input costs (e.g., feed and hay), decreased market prices for their product, and an \\nincrease in the value of the Canadian dollar. \\n[20] \\nIn response, the Crown established the Ontario Cattle, Hogs and Horticulture Payment \\n(“OCHHP”) program to financially assist eligible cattle, hog, and horticulture producers. \\n[21] \\nI will explain in further detail, below, how the OCHHP program was established and \\ndesigned; however, in short, the payment formula for the OCHHP program used the \\naverage uncapped “allowable net sales” (“ANS”) data from the then-existing federal Cost \\nof Production Payment program (“COP”), implemented in 2007, which was the same as \\nthe average uncapped ANS data used by the existing Ontario Cost Recognition Top-Up \\nprogram (“OCRT”), also implemented in 2007. \\n[22] \\nThe payment calculation for the federal COP program was based on the average uncapped \\nANS as calculated from the average net sales for 2000-2004 of eligible commodities, as \\nreported to the Canada Revenue Agency. Producers that started farming in 2005 or 2006 \\ncould apply for a COP payment, and for those producers, their COP payment calculation \\nwas based on the average uncapped ANS as calculated from their average net sales of \\neligible commodities for 2005-2006, as reported to the CRA (or only for 2006 if the farmer \\nbegan farming in that year).  \\n[23] \\nThe provincial OCRT program, implemented by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food \\nand Rural Affairs (the “Ministry”) in June 2007, provided a 40 per cent matching provincial \\ncontribution to the federal COP program. \\n[24] \\nThe OCHHP program was announced to the public on December 14, 2007. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n[25] \\nIn February 2008, the Ministry and the defendant AgriCorp entered into a payment delivery \\nagreement, pursuant to which AgriCorp administered the OCHHP program.6 The payment \\ndelivery agreement included, as an appendix, the OCHHP program Guidelines. \\n[26] \\nThe Guidelines spoke of the purpose of the OCHHP program in the following terms: \\nPurpose \\nThe Ontario Cattle, Hogs and Horticulture Payment (OCHHP) is a one time \\nprogram designed to assist cattle, hog and horticultural producers who have \\nexperienced steep losses as a result of a number of economic pressures that \\nhave led to higher input costs and lower market prices. \\n[27] \\nUnder the Guidelines, there was no application process required of producers to receive \\npayments. Rather, eligibility and payment amounts were generated from the existing \\naverage uncapped ANS information used to administer the federal COP payment and the \\nOCRT payment. If a producer met the eligibility criteria, then AgriCorp processed a \\npayment. \\n[28] \\nFor hog producers, payment amounts under the OCHHP program amounted to 12 per cent \\nof the producer’s average uncapped ANS, as shown on the producer’s one-time federal \\nCOP payment statement. \\n[29] \\nIt is common ground that, ultimately, the Ministry distributed approximately $139,000,000 \\nthrough the OCHHP program to some 13,000 producers. \\n[30] \\nThat said, the plaintiffs here received only the following OCHHP payments: \\na. Ms. O’Neil and Mila Hills received $3,750 in February 2008. \\nb. The plaintiffs Vehof Farms Inc., Johannes Vehof, and Tina Vehof received $267 in \\nFebruary 2008. \\nc. The plaintiffs Palm Creek Farms Inc., Warren Caughill, and Joanne Caughill \\nreceived $89,770 by way of two payments made in February 2008 and September \\n2008. \\nd. The plaintiffs Tom Murray and Cheryl Murray received $340 in February 2008. \\n[31] \\nNot surprisingly, given the modest amounts they received, the plaintiffs were dissatisfied \\nwith the quantum of the OCHHP payments made to them.  \\n[32] \\nFor example, while Ms. O’Neil does not dispute that the payment she received was \\ncorrectly calculated based on Mila Hills’ 2000-2004 ANS data, she voiced her objection – \\n                                                 \\n \\n6  Pursuant to the order of Cook J. dated July 30, 2023, the plaintiffs’ action against AgriCorp was dismissed without \\ncosts. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nthat the payment based on 2000-2004 ANS data did not address the needs of her expanded, \\npost-2005 operation – in the following terms: \\nThe problem is that Mila Hills’ ANS data from 2000 to 2004 did not reflect Mila \\nHills’ operation in 2007. As I described before, I had sold my first farm in 2000, \\nand in 2003 and 2004 Will and I were only engaged in a one hundred and ten \\nsow farrow-to-wean operation. In 2005, we switched to a significantly larger two \\nhundred and ten sow farrow-to-finish operation. Like other pork producers, Mila \\nHills needed assistance in 2007, but, because payment under OCHHP was \\ncalculated based on data from 2000 to 2004, the payment we received did not \\naddress the level of assistance that was needed. \\n[33] \\nI would pause to note that just because any individual plaintiff did not receive a significant \\nportion of the $139M total moneys distributed does not mean that the OCHHP program \\nwas negligently designed. \\n[34] \\nThat said, it would seem plain that there were certain deficiencies or undesirable outcomes \\nproduced by the OCHHP program. For example, the evidence indicates that, in contrast to \\nthe mere $3,750 that was received by Ms. O’Neil and the going concern of Mila Hills in \\nFebruary 2008, in that same month Mr. van Roessel – the farmer from whom Ms. O’Neil \\nand her husband purchased their farming operation in 2005 – received an OCHHP payment \\nof $38,426, despite having moved to British Columbia and retired from farming altogether. \\n[35] \\nWhile the extent of the problem is not clearly established in the evidence before me, it \\nappears that there may have been some (significant?) moneys paid to former producers \\nwho, as of the time of payment, had either retired from farming or were deceased.7 \\n[36] \\nThere is no doubt that the Ministry received numerous complaints about the OCHHP \\nprogram. The position of the Crown is that, in total, the Ministry received complaints from \\n22 hog producers about the OCHHP program, which, the Crown states, represents about 1 \\nper cent of the roughly 2,000 eligible hog producers. Generally speaking, those complaints \\nwere to the effect that the eligibility of the OCHHP program did not account for or include \\n                                                 \\n \\n7  In a letter dated December 17, 2024, from Ms. O’Neil to the Director of the Audit Service Team within the Ontario \\nMinistry of Finance, Ms. O’Neil claimed that she was made aware, through a freedom on information request, that \\n“at least 1,753 retired producers (not experiencing the crisis of 2007) received OCHHP to the value of [$]13.5 \\nmillion” and that “29% of all OCHHP hog sector cheques went to retired hog producers that were no longer in the \\nindustry and did not experience the 2007 crisis.” Copies and/or the text of the actual freedom of information request \\nand answer were not presented in evidence before me. As such, the claims set out in Ms. O’Neil’s letter are hearsay, \\nand the court is not in a position to assess the accuracy of her stated interpretations of that information or accept \\nsame at face value. Moreover, as an officer of the court, Ms. Boyczuk advised that, although not in the record, the \\nquestion that was posed through the access to information request was: what were the number of producers who, \\nno longer having 50 per cent or more of their income from the cattle, hog, or horticulture industry in 2007, received \\nan OCHHP payment? Ms. Boyczuk allowed that some of those recipients might be retired or deceased. Mr. Mackay \\nobjected to Ms. Boyczuk’s statements being relied upon by the court. For present purposes, it is not necessary for \\nthe court to determine the issue, and it is not in a position to do so, given the state of the record. I simply note that \\nthis is an unanswered question and remains in issue. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nnew producers or farmers that had changed or expanded their production – like the \\nplaintiffs here. \\n[37] \\nIn particular, the Crown concedes that, beginning in 2008, the plaintiffs made numerous \\ncomplaints to the Ministry and AgriCorp about the OCHHP program. The evidence before \\nthe court plainly establishes that Ms. O’Neil and the plaintiffs engaged in substantial \\npolitical action to attempt to persuade Ministry and other government officials to expand \\nthe OCHHP program or create a new program to better address the needs of the young \\nproducers and/or excluded farmers. The Crown points out that those complaints and efforts \\nstarted in 2008, a full eight years before the plaintiffs’ action was commenced in 2016 in \\nrespect of those same complaints. \\n[38] \\nThe evidence of the plaintiffs is that they served notice of their intended claims on the \\nCrown on July 5, 2016, as required under the Proceedings Against the Crown Act,8 which \\nwas then in effect. \\n[39] \\nThe plaintiffs served separate statements of claim on September 7, 2016. It appears that the \\nactions remained dormant for several years, but then in March 2022, the claims were all \\nconsolidated by order of Carey J. dated March 29, 2022, and a consolidated statement of \\nclaim was subsequently issued on April 21, 2022. \\n[40] \\nIn short, the plaintiffs’ claim alleges that the Crown was negligent to use “out-of-date data \\nfrom 2000-2004” for the OCHHP program because such data did not reflect the \\ncircumstance of the plaintiffs in 2007. As the Plaintiffs’ Factum puts it: \\nThe design of the program was such that the calculation of a hog farmer’s \\nassistance was based on data from the years 2000-2004. The Plaintiffs’ farming \\noperations had changed between 2000-2004 and 2007/2008. Consequently, the \\nassistance provided to the Plaintiffs did not match their need at the time of the \\nprogram. \\nThe Plaintiffs’ claim sounds in negligence, … the decision to use data from 2000-\\n2004 to calculate the quantum of assistance a hog farmer received was an \\noperational decision. \\nThe Plaintiffs’ case boils down to this: the decision to use 2000-2004 data was \\nnegligent because this decision did not align with the program’s objectives set by \\nthe Ontario government. … Because it used 2000-2004 data and reflected a hog \\nfarmer’s operation at that time, the program’s design did not align with the \\nprogram’s objectives, which was to address challenges in 2007/2008.9 \\n[Emphasis added.] \\n                                                 \\n \\n8  Proceedings Against the Crown Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.

Whether the decision to design the OCHHP program so as to base the amount of \\npayments using 2000-2004 ANS data was a policy decision or an operational \\ndecision? \\nb. In the alternative, whether the Crown owed the plaintiffs a private law duty of care \\nand, if so, whether there was a breach of the standard of care? \\nc. Whether the plaintiffs’ claim is barred by the two-year limitation period? \\nAnalysis \\nPrinciples governing motions for summary judgsment \\n[42] \\nSubrule 20.04 of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in part, that: \\nGeneral \\n(2) \\nThe court shall grant summary judgment if, \\n(a) \\nthe court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with \\nrespect to a claim or defence; or \\n(b) \\nthe parties agree to have all or part of the claim determined by a \\nsummary judgment and the court is satisfied that it is appropriate to grant \\nsummary judgment.  \\nPowers \\n(2.1) \\nIn determining under clause (2)(a) whether there is a genuine issue \\nrequiring a trial, the court shall consider the evidence submitted by the parties \\nand, if the determination is being made by a judge, the judge may exercise any \\nof the following powers for the purpose, unless it is in the interest of justice for \\nsuch powers to be exercised only at a trial: \\n1. \\nWeighing the evidence. \\n2.  \\nEvaluating the credibility of a deponent. \\n3. \\nDrawing any reasonable inference from the evidence. \\n[43] \\nAs Rady J. remarked in her decision in TD v. Testa,10 the law respecting motions for \\nsummary judgment is well settled and understood following the landmark decision of the \\n                                                 \\n \\n10  TD v. Testa, 2022 ONSC 1576 (S.C.J.), at paras. 41-43. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nSupreme Court of Canada in Hryniak v. Mauldin.11 Summary judgment must be granted \\nwhere there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. Hryniak establishes that there will be no \\ngenuine issue requiring a trial where the motion judge is able to reach a fair and just \\ndetermination on the merits on a motion for summary judgment.  \\n[44] \\nIn Hryniak, the Supreme Court directed that the summary judgment rules must be \\ninterpreted broadly, favouring proportionality and fair access to the affordable, timely, and \\njust adjudication of claims.12 On the standard of fairness, the Court held that: “the standard \\nfor fairness is not whether the procedure is as exhaustive as a trial, but whether it gives the \\njudge confidence that she can find the necessary facts and apply the relevant legal \\nprinciples so as to resolve the dispute.”13 \\n[45] \\nWriting for the unanimous Court in Hryniak, Karakatsanis J. summarized the proper \\napproach on a summary judgment motion, as follows: \\nOn a motion for summary judgment under Rule 20.04, the judge should first \\ndetermine if there is a genuine issue requiring trial based only on the evidence \\nbefore her, without using the new fact-finding powers. There will be no genuine \\nissue requiring a trial if the summary judgment process provides her with the \\nevidence required to fairly and justly adjudicate the dispute and is a timely, \\naffordable and proportionate procedure, under Rule 20.04(2)(a). If there appears \\nto be a genuine issue requiring a trial, she should then determine if the need for \\na trial can be avoided by using the new powers under Rules 20.04(2.1) and (2.2). \\nShe may, at her discretion, use those powers, provided that their use is not \\nagainst the interest of justice. Their use will not be against the interest of justice \\nif they will lead to a fair and just result and will serve the goals of timeliness, \\naffordability and proportionality in light of the litigation as a whole.14 \\n[46] \\nAs our Court of Appeal has repeatedly held, “[i]t is trite law that both parties on a summary \\njudgment motion are required to put their best foot forward. Summary judgment motions \\nare decided by evidence of the facts and by inferences drawn from those facts. Not by \\nspeculation about the facts.”15 As such, a party is not entitled to sit back and rely on the \\npossibility that more favourable facts may develop at trial. The summary judgment motion \\njudge is entitled to assume that the evidence contained in the motion record is all the \\nevidence the parties would rely on if the matter proceeded to trial. A responding party \\ncannot rely on unsupported allegations in the pleadings or unfounded assertions that there \\nis a genuine issue requiring a trial.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n11  Hryniak v.

Haditaghi, \\nthe summary judgment motion judge must “assess the advisability of the summary \\njudgment process in the context of the litigation as a whole.”17 \\n[49] \\nThe authorities are also clear that the onus is on the moving party – here, the Crown – to \\nestablish that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect to a claim or defence.18 \\nWhether the decision to design the OCHHP program so as to base the amount of \\npayments using 2000-2004 ANS data was a policy decision or an operational decision? \\n[50] \\nThe onus is on the Crown to satisfy the court that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial \\nwith respect to its claim that the decision to design the OCHHP program using the 2000-\\n2004 ANS data was a policy decision. \\n[51] \\nFor the reasons that follow, in the circumstances of the instant case, I am satisfied that the \\nCrown has met its onus in this case. \\n[52] \\nAs reviewed above, and as expressly reflected in the Plaintiffs’ Factum,19 it is clear that \\nthe plaintiffs’ claim sounds in negligence. The plaintiffs challenge the Crown’s decision to \\nuse the 2000-2004 ANS data and say that OCHHP program was designed negligently by \\nreason of its use of that data. \\n[53] \\nIt is common ground that a government’s core policy decisions are shielded from liability \\nin negligence.20 \\n[54] \\n“The primary rationale for shielding core policy decisions from liability in negligence is to \\nmaintain the separation of powers.

\\n(b) the funding of a program, project or other initiative, including, \\n(i) providing or ceasing to provide such funding, \\n(ii) increasing or reducing the amount of funding provided, \\n(iii) including, not including, amending or removing any terms or \\nconditions in relation to such funding, or \\n(iv) reducing or cancelling any funding previously provided or committed \\nin support of the program, project or other initiative; \\n(c) the manner in which a program, project or other initiative is carried out, \\nincluding, \\n(i) the carrying out, on behalf of the Crown, of some or all of a program, \\nproject or other initiative by another person or entity, including a \\nCrown agency, Crown corporation, transfer payment recipient or \\nindependent contractor, \\n(ii) the terms and conditions under which the person or entity will carry \\nout such activities, \\n(iii) the Crown’s degree of supervision or control over the person or entity \\nin relation to such activities, or \\n(iv) the existence or content of any policies, management procedures or \\noversight mechanisms concerning the program, project or other \\ninitiative;

\\n(e) the making of such regulatory decisions as may be prescribed; and \\n(f) any other policy matter that may be prescribed. \\n[58] \\nThere is no doubt that under s. 11(5) of the CLPA, the definition of a “policy matter” \\nincludes the “design” of a program (clause 11(5)(a)), the “terms” of the program (paragraph \\n11(5)(a)(i)), the “funding” of a program (clause 11(5)(b)), etc.  \\n[59] \\nThat said, the Ontario Court of Appeal has held that the enactment of the CLPA served \\nonly to codify the existing common law with respect to the Crown’s liability for negligence \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\nand “did not give the government broader immunity to that which it enjoyed for core policy \\ndecisions at common law.”23 \\n[60] \\nHowever, distinguishing between a policy decision (which cannot give rise to Crown \\nliability in negligence) and an operational decision (which may give rise to Crown liability) \\nis admittedly a distinction that out courts have found “notoriously difficult to decide.”24 \\n[61] \\nIn Nelson, the Supreme Court held that “the key focus must always be on the underlying \\npurpose of the immunity and the nature of the decision.”25 The Supreme Court in Nelson \\nidentified four factors that help in assessing the nature of a government’s decision:  \\n(1) the level and responsibilities of the decision-maker; (2) the process by which \\nthe decision was made; (3) the nature and extent of budgetary considerations; \\nand (4) the extent to which the decision was based on objective criteria. The \\nunderlying rationale – protecting the legislative and executive branch’s core \\ninstitutional roles and competencies necessary for the separation of powers – \\nserves as an overarching guiding principle for how to weigh the factors in the \\nanalysis. Thus, the nature of the decision along with the hallmarks and factors \\nthat inform its nature must be assessed in light of the purpose animating core \\npolicy immunity.26 \\n[62] \\nI would also remind myself that the question of whether the impugned design of the \\nOCHHP program involved a policy decision is a question of mixed law and fact, which \\ndepends on a factually-sensitive, contextual analysis. \\n[63] \\nAs such, it is instructive to consider the evidence concerning the impetus leading up to the \\nestablishment of the OCHHP program and the design of the program. \\n[64] \\nThe financial difficulties facing Ontario pork producers in 2007 prompted the Ontario Pork \\nProducers Marketing Board (“Ontario Pork”), which represents “the 3,600 producers who \\nproduce and market hogs in Ontario,” to ask the provincial government to provide some \\nfinancial assistance. In support of its request, Ontario Pork submitted a document in \\nOctober 2007 entitled “Ontario Pork Producer Transitional Assistance Program Request,” \\nwhich presented the rationale for the request, in part, as follows: \\nOntario’s pork producers are experiencing a severe and damaging liquidity crisis \\nowning to low market prices, high and rising corn prices, and an appreciating \\ndollar. In addition, competing provincial jurisdictions have moved quickly to help \\ntheir producers deal with the liquidity problem. … The consequence is that \\nOntario, viewed by experts .as the most competitive province, in Canada for pork \\n                                                 \\n \\n23  Leroux v. Ontario, 2023 ONCA 314, 166 O.R. (3d) 321, 481 D.L.R. (4th) 502, at para. 70. See also Francis v. \\nOntario, 2021 ONCA 197, 154 O.R. (3d) 498, 463 D.L.R.

Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45, at \\npara. 78. \\n25  Nelson, at para. 66. \\n26  Ibid., at para. 68. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\nproduction and processing, is at risk of permanently losing its competitive \\nadvantage. \\nOntario Pork has estimated that, based on projected losses to market hog \\nproducers, a new program allocation of $150 million would be required. … \\nThis funding would provide for only a portion of the total loss/hog experienced by \\nOntario’s pork production industry. However, this assistance would allow \\nproducers the time to properly evaluate their respective situations, change their \\noperations and in many cases prevent foreclosures and personal financial ruin[.] \\n[65] \\nBased on its own forecasts, Ontario Pork predicted “a gradual and orderly decline in \\nproduction of between 400,000 and 500,000 hogs per year” from 2007 to 2009. However, \\nOntario Pork warned:  \\nBut this managed decline assumes that government can act to help producers \\nweather the current financial crisis. There is a risk that without adequate \\ngovernment support at this critical point, production could decline precipitously \\nand our industry permanently damaged, with the resulting negative impacts on \\nsuppliers and rural communities. This situation existed in the 1997/98 period \\nwhen prices fell to very low levels and it took many years for the industry to come \\nback. Our industry is inherently cyclical, but the current situation goes beyond \\nwhat producers can manage. [Emphasis added.] \\n[66] \\nOntario Pork went on to identify two possible approaches for its proposed transitional \\nassistance program. The first identified option suggested providing “a top-up based on the \\n2006 Canadian Agricultural Income Stabilization (CAIS) program.” The second option – \\nwhich Ontario Pork said was “perhaps the more preferable approach” – was described as \\nfollows: \\nAnother, perhaps more preferable approach, would be to advance the funds to \\nproducers as soon as possible to deal quickly and decisively with the liquidity \\ncrisis. Ontario pork could play a role in verifying the payment amount by using its \\nproducer data base. The payment would be viewed as an advance against a \\nfuture, to be determined, CAIS payment. This approach would allow producers \\nto deal with the liquidity issue and make appropriate business decisions. It would \\nalso give time for the program amounts and CAIS funds to be accurately adjusted \\nat some future time based on actual. experience and prevent double counting of \\nprogram funds. In our view this option would also be trade neutral. [Emphasis \\nadded.] \\n[67] \\nThe following month, Ministry officials prepared a slide deck entitled “2007-2008 \\nOpportunities for Ontario to Support the Hog, Cattle and Horticultural Sectors,” dated \\nNovember 26, 2007, which was marked as “Confidential Advice to the Minister,” to \\nconsider financial assistance options for producers. Again, two options were identified as \\nproviding a basis for additional assistance to Ontario Farmers, as follows: (1) “2005 CAIS \\n[Canadian Agricultural Income Stabilization] Reference Margins including BSE [bovine \\nspongiform encephalopathy] Payments” and (2) “Allowable Net Sales used for the Federal \\nCost of Production (FCOP) Payment and the Ontario Cost Recognition Top-Up (OCRT).” \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\n[68] \\nThe advice to the Minister noted in respect of the second option based on ANS that \\n“FCOP/ORCT was based on average of ANS for 2000-2004, up to a maximum of \\n$450,000”. \\n[69] \\nThe advice to the Minister also noted, inter alia, that both options were “[r]elatively simply \\nto calculate and could be delivered by AgriCorp by March 31, 2008 (e.g. Late February)”, \\nboth options simply take a predetermined amount of funds and distribute it to a \\npredetermined group of farmers, and both options “raise some trade policy concerns \\nregarding the potential to attract attention from the U.S. regarding countervailing duty \\naction.” \\n[70] \\nThe advice to the Minister set out certain identified advantages and disadvantages for each \\nof the two options, as follows: \\n1. 2005 CAIS Reference Margins including BSE Payments \\nPros \\n• \\nData is readily available \\n• \\nIncluding BSE payments would help cattle producers \\n• \\nReinforces CAIS/AgriStability as main support vehicle \\n• \\nProducers should be able to calculate their benefits, although inclusion of \\nBSE payments would make this more difficult for cattle producers \\nCons \\n• \\nNot all producers participate in CAIS – there would be demands to allow \\nan application process that would run into the next fiscal year \\n• \\nSome cattle producers have very low or negative reference margins – \\nmeaning low payments \\n• \\nBSE only affects 2004 in this case so impact is minimal \\n• \\nRequires recalculation of reference margins to include BSE payments \\n• \\nInclusion of BSE payments makes it less bankable and not WTO compliant \\n. . . . \\n2. Allowable Net Sales Used for the FCOP and OCRT payments \\nPros \\n• \\nData is readily available \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\n• \\nWould provide payments to a larger group of producers, so fewer would \\nargue that they were missed  \\n• \\nLikely simpler administratively than option 1 since no recalculation of data \\nrequire (i.e. inclusion of BSE payments) \\n• \\nProducers should be able to take information from the FCOP/OCRT \\npayments to calculate their payment under this program \\nCons \\n• \\nCattle & hog producers have had concerns with ANS \\n• \\nNo way to include BSE payments to further help cattle producers \\n[71] \\nUltimately, the Minister determined to design the OCHHP program using the second \\noption, based on the COP/OCRT ANS data, instead of the CAIS option as the basis for the \\nfinancial support. As an internal Ministry email dated December 10, 2007, put it: “[t]he \\nminister decided to go the way of ANS instead of CAIS.” A draft Treasury Board Minute \\nwas prepared and was attached to that same email. \\n[72] \\nAt a meeting of the Treasury Board/Management Board of Cabinet “(Treasury Board”) \\nheld on December 13, 2007, the Treasury Board approved the program. The minutes of the \\nTreasury Board meeting that day record the decision to establish the program, the program \\ndetails and funding formula design, and reflect the directive that all funds were to be \\ndistributed by March 31, 2008, as follows: \\nAgriculture, Food and Rural Affairs \\na) \\nApproved $130,000,000 for the Ontario Cattle, Hogs and Horticulture Payment \\nto support livestock ($100,000,000) and horticulture ($30,000,000) producers to \\nmanage low commodity prices and escalating input costs, in the Agri-Food \\nSector. In this regard, the Board: \\ni. \\nApproved the creation of a new transfer payment line entitled \\n“Assistance for Ontario Cattle, Hogs and Horticulture” under Agri-Food \\nSector including Business Risk Management (Vote/Item 105-1). \\nii. \\nApproved the following program details: \\na. Producers who participated in the Cost Recognition Top-up \\nProgram and have more than 50% of their total sales from their \\ncombined sales of hogs, cattle and horticulture are eligible. \\nb. Payments are based on a percentage of a producers total \\nuncapped allowable net sales as calculated for the Ontario Cost \\nRecognition Top-Up Program. \\nc. Payments are capped at a maximum of $3 million per producer. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\nd. Outstanding monies owing to the government of Ontario due to \\npast overpayments in other programs would not be recovered \\nagainst payments for the Ontario Cattle, Hogs and Horticulture \\nprogram. \\ne. The payments will be administered by AgriCorp. \\nf. \\nNoted that all funding must be distributed by March 31, 2008 \\nfollowing appropriate accountability and accounting practices or \\nreturned to the Treasury Board Contingency Fund. [Emphasis \\nadded.] \\n[73] \\nWhile I note that the OCHHP program, as recommended by the Minister and approved by \\nTreasury Board, did not adopt either of the two options that had been proposed by Ontario \\nPork in October 2007, the requirement of the OCHHP program that all funds must be \\ndistributed by March 31, 2008, was consistent with the rationale for the second, “more \\npreferable” option proposed by Ontario Pork “to advance the funds to producers as soon as \\npossible to deal quickly and decisively with the liquidity crisis.” \\n[74] \\nIn all of the circumstances, I agree with the position of the Crown that while the \\nimplementation or application of the funding formula under the OCHHP program to any \\nparticular farmer is arguably operational, the decision to design the OCHHP program using \\nthe 2000-2004 ANS data as the basis for the funding formula was itself an integral part of \\nthe Crown’s decision to subsidize farmers. In my view, it is not the case, as the plaintiffs \\nargue, that the policy decisions here include only the decision to establish the OCHHP \\nprogram and the decision to allocate $139M to the OCHHP program. The decision to use \\nthe 2000-2004 ANS date as the basis for the funding formula was also a policy decision. \\n[75] \\nConsidering the level and responsibilities of the decision-maker, the decision to use the \\n2000-2004 ANS date as the basis for the funding formula for the OCHHP program was \\nrecommended by the Minister and made by Cabinet, consistent with the powers and duties \\nof the Minister and the Lieutenant Governor in Counsel as set out in ss. 4 and 7 of the \\nMinistry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Act.27 To be sure, this was not some \\nfunding decision made by a junior ministry official or some administrative staffer. This \\nwas a decision made by the highest echelons of government – by the Cabinet itself, acting \\non the recommendation of a Minister of the Crown. \\n[76] \\nMoreover, as expressly reflected in the Treasury Board Minute of the decision of Cabinet, \\nthe decision to use the 2000-2004 ANS date as the basis for the funding formula for the \\nOCHHP program was explicitly set out in the Treasury Board Minute. That is, in the same \\nbreath that Cabinet decided to establish the OCHHP program, in the same breath that \\nCabinet decided (at least initially) to allocate $130M to the OCHHP program, in the same \\nbreath that Cabinet decided that the moneys must be distributed to the farmers by March \\n31, 2008, Cabinet also decided that “payments are based on a percentage of a producers \\n                                                 \\n \\n27  Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.16, ss. 4(1 \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\ntotal uncapped allowable net sales as calculated for the Ontario Cost Recognition Top-Up \\nProgram” – that is, Cabinet decided to use the 2000-2004 ANS date as the basis for the \\nfunding formula for the OCHHP program. \\n[77] \\nSecond, in considering the process by which the impugned decision was made, on the \\nevidence before this court (including the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from \\nthat evidence), it is clear that the decision-making process that led up to the \\nrecommendation by the Minister and decision by Cabinet to use the 2000-2004 ANS date \\nas the basis for the funding formula for the OCHHP program involved input from \\nstakeholders (Ontario Pork represented 3,600 hog producers), contemplated the advantages \\nand disadvantages of competing policy options, considered the far-ranging implications of \\ninternational trade risks, and, in keeping with the recommendation of Ontario Pork “to \\nadvance the funds to producers as soon as possible to deal quickly and decisively with the \\nliquidity crisis,” included a requirement that all funds under the OCHHP program must be \\ndistributed by March 31, 2008. Clearly, this was not a decision that can be characterized as \\na reaction of a Ministry employee or groups of Ministry officials to a particular event, \\nreflecting their discretion and with no sustained period of deliberation.28  \\n[78] \\nThird, considering the nature and extent of budgetary considerations, the decision to use \\nthe 2000-2004 ANS date as the basis for the OCHHP program was the means to allocate \\n$139M in funds. It was far from a day-to-day budgetary decision of an individual Ministry \\nemployee.29 Rather, the decision to use the 2000-2004 ANS data was central to the \\nallocation of significant government resources to 13,000 plus cattle, hog, and horticulture \\nproducers. The decision to use the readily-available 2000-2004 ANS data as the basis for \\nthe OCHHP program facilitated the payment of the program funds as quickly as possible \\nto meet a liquidity crisis in the industry. It avoided using an application process to obtain \\nmore current data, which would have proved time-consuming and administratively more \\ncomplicated (and in this regard, it is noteworthy that 2007 raw tax data would not have \\nbeen available until the fall of 2008, and, even then, it would have needed to be further \\ninputted and calculated for use in a program). It permitted most of the funds to be \\ndistributed by March 31, 2008. In my view, determining the basis for the allocation of \\ngovernment funds does raise separation of powers concerns and is more within the core \\ncompetency of the executive, as opposed to the courts. Determining the basis for the \\nallocation of limited public monetary resources is core government policy. \\n[79] \\nFourth, in considering the extent to which the decision was based on objective criteria, I \\nfind that the decision to use the 2000-2004 ANS data as the basis for the OCHHP program \\nwas a decision that involved the weighing of competing interests and the making of value \\njudgments. The confidential advice to the Minister included the presentation of the \\nrespective advantages and disadvantages of competing options, including how the different \\noptions might impact the interests of different stakeholders. It is plain that the Minister’s \\ndecision to recommend the use of the 2000-2004 ANS data was, in part, motivated by the \\n                                                 \\n \\n28  See Nelson, at para. 63. \\n29  Ibid., at para. 64. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\nvalue judgment that some priority should be given to the interest to dispersing the moneys \\nas quickly as possible to farmers to assist them in weathering the liquidity crisis that they \\nwere facing within the industry. The disbursement of (ultimately) $139M in public \\nresources involved some 13,000 producers. In my view, it is a fair inference to conclude \\nthat while some producers, like the plaintiffs here, would have preferred that the program \\nuse some different basis for allocation other than the use of the 2000-2004 ANS data, \\nperhaps even if it took longer to provide the subsidy, no doubt other producers benefitted \\nfrom the speed with which the moneys were distributed, which, in part, was facilitated by \\nthe use of the 2000-2004 ANS data. At the end of the day, the Crown decided to expedite \\nsubsidy payments, which involved using past program data. In my view, this was a value \\njudgment involving competing producer interests. This was a policy decision. \\n[80] \\nIn sum, I find that the Crown’s decision to use the readily-available 2000-2004 ANS data \\nas the basis for the OCHHP program was a policy decision, in respect of which the \\nplaintiffs’ claim in negligence is prohibited at common law and under s. 11(4) of the CLPA. \\n[81] \\nThe Crown has satisfied its burden to show, and I find, that there is no genuine issue \\nrequiring a trial on whether the Crown’s decision to design the OCHHP program so as to \\nbase the amount of payments using 2000-2004 ANS data was a policy decision or an \\noperational decision. I have found that it was a policy decision. The action must be \\ndismissed. \\nIn the alternative, whether the Crown owed the plaintiffs a private law duty of care \\nand, if so, whether there was a breach of the standard of care? \\n[82] \\nGiven my decision that the Crown’s decision to design the OCHHP program based on the \\n2000-2004 ANS data was a policy decision, it is not necessary to address the Crown’s \\nalternative argument that the Crown did not owe the plaintiffs a private duty of care and, \\nfurther, that the Crown did not breach any consequent standard of care. \\nWhether the plaintiffs’ claim is barred by the two-year limitation period? \\n[83] \\nWhile all counsel are agreed that a decision by the court that the plaintiffs in this case are \\nseeking to challenge a policy decision – as I have found here – puts an end to the action on \\nthat basis alone, I would also consider the Crown’s argument that the plaintiffs’ claim is \\nstatute-barred by the two-year limitation period under the Limitations Act, 2002.  \\n[84] \\nIn my view, there is merit in the Crown’s position.  \\n[85] \\nThere is no real dispute between the parties as to the applicable legal principles. \\n[86] \\nThe basis two-year limitation period is set out in s. 4 of the Limitations Act, 2002, which \\nprovides: \\nUnless this Act provides otherwise, a proceeding shall not be commenced in \\nrespect of a claim after the second anniversary of the day on which the claim was \\ndiscovered. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\n[87] \\nSubsection 5(1) of the Limitations Act, 2002 provides that: \\nA claim is discovered on the earlier of, \\n(a) the day on which the person with the claim first knew, \\n(i) that the injury, loss or damage had occurred, \\n(ii) that the injury, loss or damage was caused by or contributed to by \\nan act or omission, \\n(iii) that the act or omission was that of the person against whom the \\nclaim is made, and \\n(iv) that, having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a \\nproceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy it; and \\n(b) the day on which a reasonable person with the abilities and in the \\ncircumstances of the person with the claim first ought to have known of \\nthe matters referred to in clause (a).  \\n[88] \\nIn short, s. 5(1) provides that a claim is discovered when the claimant first knew, or \\nreasonably ought to have known, that “having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or \\ndamage, a proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy it.” \\n[89] \\nA claim is discovered when a plaintiff has knowledge, actual or constructive, of the \\nmaterial facts on which a plausible inference of liability on the defendant’s part can be \\ndrawn. In its recent decision in Levac v. James,30 our Court of Appeal explained when a \\nclaim is discovered, relying on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Grant Thornton \\nLLP v. New Brunswick,31 as follows: \\nUnder s. 5 of the Limitations Act, 2002, a claim is discovered on the earlier of the \\ndate when the plaintiff knew or ought to have known that an incident occurred \\nthat resulted in a loss (s. 5(1)(a)(i)), that the defendant did or failed to do \\nsomething to cause that loss (s. 5(1)(a)(ii) and (iii)), and that, having regard to \\nthe nature of the injury, loss, or damage, a court proceeding is an appropriate \\nmeans to seek a remedy (s. 5(1)(a)(iv)): Gordon Dunk Farms Limited v.

James, at para. 105. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\n[90] \\nIn Grant Thornton, the Supreme Court held that knowledge may be actual or constructive, \\nand that “a plaintiff will have constructive knowledge when the evidence shows that the \\nplaintiff ought to have discovered the material facts by exercising reasonable diligence.”33 \\nFurther, the court clarified that: “a plaintiff does not need knowledge of all the constituent \\nelements of a claim to discover that claim.”34 \\n[91] \\nSubsection 5(2) of the Limitations Act, 2002 creates a presumption that a person with a \\nclaim knows the matters referred to in s. 5(1)(a) on the day the act or omission on which \\nthe claim is based occurred, unless the contrary is proven. \\n[92] \\nParagraph 72 of the Plaintiffs’ Factum concedes that: “[t]he Plaintiffs do not dispute that \\nthey were aware in 2008 of the harm they suffered as a result of the decision to use the \\n2000-2004 ANS data.” \\n[93] \\nIndeed, the plaintiffs acknowledge that the Crown points to correspondence sent and \\nreceived by the plaintiffs in 2008 (as part of their complaints to the Ministry and their \\npolitical action seeking an expanded OCHHP program or the creation of a new program \\nfor young farmers); the plaintiffs acknowledge that the Crown claims that the \\ncorrespondence of the plaintiffs “demonstrates that [they] were aware that they were \\nharmed by the use of the 2000-2004 ANS data as the basis for calculating OCHHP program \\npayments.”35 \\n[94] \\nAgain, the statements of claim here were not commenced until September 2016. \\n[95] \\nHowever, the argument of the plaintiffs is that they did not actually discover their claim \\nuntil after Ms. O’Neil obtained the Guidelines under the OCHHP program through a \\nfreedom of information request in July 2014.36 \\n[96] \\nThe plaintiffs argue that the evidence of Ms. O’Neil is that she had been told that the \\nOCHHP program was designed to address “long-standing hurt” to farmers in the hog \\nindustry,37 and that it was not until she obtained the Guidelines on July 7, 2014, that she \\nrealized that the purpose of the OCHHP was not to address long-standing hurt but, rather, \\nit was designed to help farmers that were experiencing harms in 2007. “That is when I \\nrealized that the OCHHP really was for us beginning farmers.”38 \\n[97] \\nRespectfully, I do not accept the plaintiffs’ argument. \\n[98] \\nIn my view, as reflected in the plaintiffs’ statement of claim and in the Plaintiffs’ Factum, \\nthe claim of the plaintiffs focuses on the alleged negligent design of the OCHHP program \\n                                                 \\n \\n33  Grant Thornton, at para. 44. \\n34  Ibid., at para. 3. \\n35  Plaintiffs’ Factum, at para. 71.  \\n36  Ibid., at para. 69. \\n37  Ibid., at para. 65. \\n38  Ibid., at para. 66 and evidentiary references cited therein. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\nby reason of the Crown’s decision to design the OCHHP program using the 2000-2004 \\nANS data as the basis for the funding formula. \\n[99] \\nIn the Plaintiffs’ Factum, the plaintiffs argue that the Crown’s decision to use the 2000-\\n2004 ANS data as the basis for the funding formula “was negligent because this decision \\ndid not align with the program’s objectives set by the Ontario government.”39 \\n[100] However, in my respectful view, that is not the basis for the negligence claim as actually \\npleaded in the plaintiffs’ statement of claim. \\n[101] Rather, in the plaintiffs’ 33-paragraph consolidated statement of claim, they plead that: \\na. “OMAFRA [the Ministry] made a policy decision to assist pork producers. It \\ndeveloped the Ontario Cattle, Hog and Horticulture … program in late 2007.” (Para. \\n11). \\nb. “Eligibility and payment amounts to each producer was based on average ‘allowable \\nnet sales’ from out-of-date data from 2000-2004. Allowable net sales is a term used \\nin other programs in the industry.” (Para. 13). \\nc. “Because of the changes in their business structures, the Operating Entities [i.e., the \\nplaintiffs] suffered very large losses as market hogs declined in value while feed \\ncosts increased. However, the Operating Entities were only eligible for small \\nOCHHP payments because their allowable net sales of market weight hogs had been \\nvery small prior to their changes in business structure, and therefore in the period \\nused for averaging [i.e., 2000-2004].” (Para. 23). \\nd. “All of the Beneficial Owners suffered great personal hardship.” (Para. 26.) \\ne. “The Defendants knew, or ought to have known, that the OCHHP producer database \\nfor eligibility and payment [i.e., the 2000-2004 ANS data] was out-of-date and many \\nproducers, who were in a state of flux, were changing their businesses in an effort to \\nsurvive. The Defendants were obligated to take such changes into account and into \\ntheir risk considerations.” (Para. 31.) [Emphasis added.] \\nf. “Despite requests and demands, the Defendants have refused or neglected to deal \\nwith this issue.” (Para. 32.) \\n[102] Clearly, to the extent that the plaintiffs’ statement of claim pleads negligent design of the \\nOCHHP program, as the Plaintiffs’ Factum says it does, the alleged negligent design is the \\nCrown’s decision to use the “out-of-date” 2000-2004 ANS data as the basis for the OCHHP \\nprogram. \\n                                                 \\n \\n39  Plaintiffs’ Factum, at para. 4. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\n[103] That said, I do acknowledge that in para. 30 of their consolidated statement of claim, the \\nplaintiffs do state that they “learned in July of 2014 that OMAFRA directives were not \\nfollowed by AgriCorp and that OMAFRA chose not to pursue the subject.”  \\n[104] However, even assuming for the moment that the language of para. 30 of the statement of \\nclaim is meant to refer to the alleged revelation of Ms. O’Neil that the realized in July 2014 \\nthat the purpose of the OCHHP was not to address long-standing hurt but, rather, was \\ndesigned to help farmers that were experiencing harms in 2007, as it stands now, I regard \\npara. 30 of the statement of claim to be a pleading of fact. There is no plea in para. 30 that \\nthis alleged negligence constituted negligence. There is no plea that any such alleged \\nnegligence caused the plaintiffs to suffer damage. \\n[105] In sum, while the plaintiffs submit in their Plaintiffs’ Factum that they did not discover \\nuntil July 2014 that “the use of the 2000-2004 ANS data did not align with the OCHHP’s \\nobjective,”40 that assertion is not found in the statement of claim as an allegation of \\nnegligence. What the plaintiffs’ statement of claim alleges is that the Crown’s decision to \\nuse the “out-of-date” 2000-2004 ANS data as the basis for the OCHHP program was \\nnegligent. And, on their own admission, the plaintiffs well knew that OCHHP program was \\nbased on the 2000-2004 ANS data back in 2008. They did not commence their actions until \\n2016. Their claims are statute-barred. \\n[106] However, beyond the fact that I do not accept the plaintiffs’ claim or characterization that \\ntheir action for negligence is based on their alleged “discovery” in 2014 that “the use of \\nthe 2000-2004 ANS data did not align with the OCHHP’s objective”41 – I think the \\nlanguage of their statement of claim speaks for itself – I also do not accept the plaintiffs’ \\nclaim that it was not until July 7, 2014, that the plaintiffs learned for the first time that the \\npurpose of the OCHHP program was to “help farmers that were experiencing harms in \\n2007.” 42 \\n[107] Respectfully, I think the plaintiffs well knew in or about 2008 that one of the purposes of \\nthe OCHHP program was to “help farmers that were experiencing harms in 2007.” In my \\nview, that purpose could not have been lost on them. Respectfully, I view any claim to the \\ncontrary – that is, any claim that they did not know until July 2014 that the purposes of the \\nOCHHP program included the objective to “help farmers that were experiencing harms in \\n2007” – to be strategic and specious. \\n[108] In particular, I find that the plaintiffs knew or ought to have known in or about 2008 that \\none of the purposes of the OCHHP program was to “help farmers that were experiencing \\nharms in 2007” given the following evidence: \\n                                                 \\n \\n40  Ibid., at para. 72. \\n41  Ibid. \\n42  See Plaintiffs’ Factum, at para. 66, citing Responding Motion Record, dated May 15, 2023, Tab 1, Affidavit of \\nUrsula van den Heuvel O’Neil sworn May 15, 2023, at para. 31 [CaseLines Master Page B-1-137]. \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\na. In para. 31 of her affidavit sworn May 15, 2023, Ms. O’Neil states that: \\nI very clearly remember reading the purpose of the OCHHP as written in the \\nGuidelines.  \\nPurpose  \\nThe Ontario Cattle, Hogs and Horticulture Payment (OCHHP) is a one time \\nprogram designed to assist cattle, hog and horticultural producers who have \\nexperienced stee[ losses as a result of a number of economic pressures that \\nhave led to higher input costs and lower market prices.  \\nThis is when I realized that the purpose of the OCHHP was not to address \\nlongstanding hurt; it was to help farmers that were experiencing harms in 2007. This \\nis when I realized that the OCHHP really was for us beginning farmers. [Emphasis \\nadded.] \\nb. However, the actual Treasury Board Minute of December 13, 2007, evidencing the \\ndecision of Cabinet to establish the OCHHP program stated that it approved $130M \\nfor the OCHHP program “to support … producers to manage low commodity prices \\nand escalating input costs”. The purpose of the OCHHP program was thus expressly \\nset out in the Treasury Board Minute of December 2007, and the reference to low \\ncommodity prices and escalating input costs was a reference to the difficulties that \\nhog producers and others were facing in 2007. I note there was no reference in the \\nTreasury Board Minute to “long-standing hurt.” \\nc. The October 2007 submission of Ontario Pork stated that “Ontario’s pork producers \\nare experiencing a severe and damaging liquidity crisis owning to low market prices, \\nhigh and rising corn prices, and an appreciating dollar.” Again, there was no \\nreference to “long-standing hurt.” \\nd. It could not have been lost on the plaintiffs that the Crown announced the \\nestablishment of the OCHHP program in December 2007, with the directive that all \\npayments were to be made by end of March 2008. Surely that fact alone would have \\nregistered with the plaintiffs – or certainly with the reasonable person in the hog \\nindustry – that the objective of the OCHHP program was “to help farmers that were \\nexperiencing harms in 2007.” Otherwise, if the purpose was just to address, as the \\nplaintiffs say they understood “long-standing hurt,” why was it that the \\nestablishment of the OCHHP program was announced in December 2007 with all \\nfunds to be distributed by end of March 2008? I do not accept that the plaintiffs \\nbelieved that the timing of such a program to address, as they would have the court \\nbelieve, only “long-standing hurt” was so coincidental with the liquidity crisis facing \\nOntario hog farmers in 2007. Surely the timing of the announcement of the OCHHP \\nprogram was not lost on the plaintiffs. \\ne. I agree with Crown counsel’s contention that the plaintiffs are engaging in a “cherry-\\npicking” exercise here. They emphasize, for example, statements in the House where \\nthe Minister expressed the sentiment that the government program (also) intended to \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 25 \\n \\n \\naddress long-standing hurt, while ignoring clear statements – that were known to the \\nplaintiffs – that the purpose of the OCHHP program certainly also included \\nattempting to address the desire “to help farmers that were experiencing harms in \\n2007.” Hence the statement in the Estimates Committee of the Legislative Assembly \\nby M.P. Ernie Hardeman to the Minister that: \\nWhat they explained to me was that because of a number of consecutive years of \\nlosses in their sectors, exacerbated by the high Canadian dollar and higher input \\ncosts, there was a very serious, significant and immediate need. \\nf. In my view, a very complete rebuttal of the plaintiffs’ claims that “we didn’t know \\nuntil July 2014” is set out in the comparison chart appearing at Tab 29 of the Oral \\nArgument Compendium of the Crown dated August 15, 2023, and I accept and adopt \\nfor my own reasons that comparison chart as demonstrating that the plaintiffs well \\nknew that one of the purposes of the OCHHP program was “to help farmers that \\nwere experiencing harms in 2007.” \\ng. Consequently, on the evidence before me, I find that, contrary to the suggestion in \\npara. 31 et seq. of Ms. O’Neil’s affidavit sworn May 15, 2023, and paras. 20-21 and \\n72 of the Plaintiffs’ Factum, the plaintiffs were well aware in or about 2008 that one \\nof the purposes of the OCHHP program was “to help farmers that were experiencing \\nharms in 2007.” \\n[109] For all of these reasons, I find that the plaintiffs had sufficient knowledge in or about 2008 \\nto draw a plausible inference of liability to support an allegation of negligence against the \\nCrown. I find that the plaintiffs knew or reasonably ought to have known in 2008 that, \\nhaving regard to the nature of their alleged injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be \\nan appropriate means to seek to remedy it. Moreover, I also find that a reasonable person \\nwith the abilities and in the circumstances of the plaintiffs first ought to have known that \\nthey had a claim against the defendants in or about 2008. \\n[110] On the basis of all of the evidence before the court, I find that the plaintiffs have not \\ndisplaced the presumption created by s. 5(2) of the Limitations Act, 2002. \\n[111] In sum, I find that the Crown has established that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial \\nas to whether the plaintiffs’ claim is statute-barred by the two-year limitation period under \\nthe Limitations Act, 2002. I find that the plaintiffs’ claim is barred by the two-year \\nlimitation period. \\nConclusion \\n[112] For all of these reasons, I allow the Crown’s motion for summary dismissal. The Crown \\nhas satisfied me that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial. \\n[113] In para. 128 of the Crown’s Factum, the Crown makes the following submission: \\n2024 ONSC 1914 (CanLII)\\nPage: 26 \\n \\n \\nIf the action is dismissed on the basis of the CLPA, the Crown seeks no costs \\nper s. 11(8) of the CLPA. If the action is not dismissed on the basis of the CLPA, \\nbut is dismissed on the basis of the common law or the Limitations Act, 2002, the \\nCrown seeks its partial indemnity costs. [Underlined emphasis in original.] \\n[114] In the instant case, I have found that the plaintiffs’ claim cannot be maintained against the \\nCrown because it challenges a policy decision. In other words, to use the language of para. \\n128 of the Crown’s factum, I have dismissed the plaintiffs’ action on the basis of the CLPA \\n(as well as it having been commenced after the limitation period). As such, in accordance \\nwith para. 128 of the Crown’s factum and s. 11(8) of the CLPA, the action is dismissed \\nwithout costs. \\n[115] In any event, even if I had not dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim on the basis of the CLPA but \\nhad otherwise found that the Crown should succeed, I still would have made no order as to \\ncosts. Given the circumstances of the plaintiffs, and the frustrations and hardships caused \\nto them by reason of the deficiencies in the Crown program, this is not an appropriate case \\nto make an order of costs against the plaintiffs. \\n[116] The action of the plaintiffs is dismissed without costs. \\n \\n \\n \\nOriginal signed by “Justice J.

Di Luca J.  \\nCOUNSEL: Jason Huang-Kung and Alyssa Suddard, Counsel for the Plaintiff  \\nNikolay Chsherbinin, Counsel for the Defendants  \\nHEARD: \\nMarch 6, 2024 \\nENDORSEMENT \\n \\n[1] \\nThis is a Rule 21.01(1)(b) motion by the corporate defendant, Medical Respiratory Care Inc. \\n(“MRC”), to strike the action against it on the basis that the Statement of Claim discloses no \\nreasonable cause of action.  \\n[2] \\nThe action relates to an alleged breach of contract for construction/renovation services \\nprovided by Alphyn Homes in relation to Mr. Tiltack’s personal residence. The defendants \\nargue that the plaintiff has impermissibly pleaded the action by alleging a breach of contract \\nagainst Mr. Tiltack and/or MRC, without providing any particular allegations in relation to \\nthe corporate defendant. In short, the defendant argues that the plaintiff has “pleaded in the \\nmuch condemned, conjunctive-disjunctive fashion, using ‘and/or’ and ‘or either of them.’” \\n[3] \\nThe plaintiff’s position is that it is unclear who the parties to the contract are and as a result, \\nthe pleadings include both the individual defendant and the corporate defendant. The \\nplaintiff submits that it would gladly discontinue the action against the corporate defendant \\nif Mr. Tiltack, through counsel, would undertake not to later take the position that the \\ncontract was with the corporate defendant.  \\n[4] \\nDuring the hearing of the motion, the court asked counsel, who acts for both defendants, \\nwhether he was prepared to give an undertaking to not take the position that the corporate \\nentity was a party to the contract in exchange for the plaintiff discontinuing the action against \\nthe corporation. Counsel declined to do so, essentially stating that in his view he was not \\nrequired to provide any such undertaking in the face of fatally flawed pleadings. \\n2024 ONSC 1917 (CanLII)\\nPage 2 \\n \\n \\n \\nBackground Facts \\n[5] \\nOn July 14, 2023, the Statement of Claim was issued. At paragraph 5 of the Statement of \\nClaim, the plaintiff pleads: \\nOn or about May 5, 2021, Alphyn Homes entered into a contract with Mr. \\nTiltack and/or MRC for the supply of labour and materials for the \\nimprovement of the Subject Property (the “Contract”). The parties’ \\ncontract was set out in a construction agreement prepared by Alphyn \\nHomes. While it was not executed, the Defendants agreed to the terms and \\nconditions. \\n[6] \\nAt paragraph 13 of the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff pleads: \\nDespite the Subject Property being Mr. Tiltack’s place of residence, Mr. \\nTiltack requested that Alphyn Home’s invoices be issued to “MRC \\nHealthcare Inc.”. Alphyn Homes agreed to issue invoices to “MRC \\nHealthcare Inc.”, despite the Contract being with Mr. Tiltack. \\n[7] \\nThe plaintiff also pleads that six payments were made towards the amounts owing on the \\ncontract, including three payments made by a cheque from “MRC Healthcare Inc.” \\n[8] \\nOn August 24, 2023, the defendants served an initial Request to Inspect which resulted in \\nproduction of an unsigned contract between Alphyn Homes and MRC, dated May 5, 2021 \\nand a copy of an invoice dated December 5, 2022 issued to “Mr. Colin Tiltack.” \\n[9] \\nOn August 31, 2023, the defendants served a further Request to Inspect seeking copies of \\nthe invoices allegedly issued to MRC, as specified in paragraph 13 of the Statement of Claim. \\nThat same day, the plaintiff responded and admitted that there were no such invoices. \\n[10] The defendants requested that the action be discontinued against MRC. Instead, the plaintiff \\namended the Statement of Claim by deleting paragraph 13 and adding the words “or either \\nof them” where the word “defendants” appear in paragraphs 5 and 11.  \\n[11] The defendant describes the plaintiff’s efforts to keep MRC in the litigation as “an abuse of \\nprocess” and a “vexatious pressure tactic.” \\nIssues and Analysis \\n[12] The first issue raised deals with what is alleged to be the improper withdrawal of an \\nadmission by the plaintiff. In particular, the defendants assert that paragraph 13 of the initial \\nStatement of Claim amounted to an admission that the contract was with Mr. Tiltack only \\nand not MRC. Assuming that to be the case, the defendants argue that the Amended \\nStatement of Claim impermissibly withdrew the admission in violation of Rule 51.05 of the \\n2024 ONSC 1917 (CanLII)\\nPage 3 \\n \\n \\nRules of Civil Procedure which stipulates that an admission in a pleading may be withdrawn \\non consent or with leave of the court.1  \\n[13] The caselaw takes a restrictive approach to the definition of an admission. In order to be \\nvalid, an admission must be an intentional, unambiguous and deliberate concession. It is rare \\nto find an admission in a Statement of Claim, see Vale Canada Limited v. Solway Investment \\nGroup Limited et al., 2021 ONSC 7562 at paras. 135-139 citing, Canadian Premier Life Ins. \\nCo. v. Sears Canada Inc., 2011 ONSC 1670, at para. 22, Yang (Litigation Guardian of) v. \\nSimcoe (County), 2011 ONSC 6405, at para. 46, and Stronach v. Stronach, 2021 ONSC \\n3801, at paras. 82-84. \\n[14] The simple answer to the issue in this case is that the original paragraph 13 did not amount \\nto an admission that the contract was only with Mr. Tiltack. It was simply a “choice of \\nwords” which when viewed in the context of the whole Statement of Claim was obviously \\nnot intended to clearly and unequivocally admit that the contract was only with Mr. Tiltack. \\nIndeed, in eight other instances in the Statement of Claim, Alphyn Homes alleged that it \\ncontracted with Mr. Tiltack and/or MRC.  \\n[15] I turn next to central issue, which is whether the pleading is improper insofar as it makes \\nundifferentiated allegations against Mr. Tiltack and MRC.  \\n[16] The parties agree on the test for striking a claim under Rule 21.01(1)(b). A claim will only \\nbe struck where it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the \\npleading discloses no reasonable cause of action, see R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., \\n2011 SCC 42, at para. 17 and Abbasbayli v. Fiera Foods Company, 2021 ONCA 95, at para. \\n20. Viewing the test in the context of this action, I must determine whether, assuming all the \\nfacts pleaded are true, it is plain and obvious that the plaintiff contracted with either the \\npersonal defendant or his company or both. If so, the action survives the review. The action \\nagainst the corporate defendant fails if, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, it is plain and \\nobvious that the plaintiff only contracted with the individual defendants. \\n[17] In the ordinary course, no evidence is admissible on a Rule 21.01(1)(b) motion. However, \\nwhere a pleading refers to a specific document, such as a contract, the court can consider the \\ndocument in determining whether the claim should be struck, see Gaur v. Datta, 2015 ONCA \\n151, at para. 5 and McCreight v. Canada, 2013 ONCA 483, at para. 29. \\n[18] The defendants argue that MRC is not a party to the contract with Alphyn Homes. They also \\nargue that the pleadings fail to allege material facts against MRC and that in the absence of \\nproperly pleaded material facts, there is simply no cause of action against MRC. In effect, \\nMRC is left in the dark in terms of knowing what is specifically alleged against it by the \\nplaintiff.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 The defendants’ Notice of Motion does not plead reliance on Rule 51.05 or Rule 26 dealing with amendment of the \\npleadings. The plaintiff argues the resort to these Rules in the context of the Rule 21.01(1)(b) motion is therefore \\nimproper. In view of my analysis of the substantive issue, I need not address this issue. \\n2024 ONSC 1917 (CanLII)\\nPage 4 \\n \\n \\n[19] In support of this argument, the defendants cite a body of caselaw that is critical of \\nundifferentiated pleadings which draw no factual distinction between the acts of a corporate \\nentity and the acts of employees or directors of the corporate entity, see for example, ACI \\nBrands Inc. v. Aviva Insurance Co. of Canada, 2014 ONSC 4559, at para. 12 and 460635 \\nOntario Ltd. v. 1002953 Ontario Inc., 1999 CanLII 789 (ONCA), at paras. 7-8 and Owners, \\nStrata Plan No. VIS3578 v. John A. Neilson Architects Inc., 2010 BCCA 329, at para. 71. \\n[20] There is no issue that privity of contract must be established in order for the terms of a \\ncontract to be enforced as against a party. There is also no issue, that in some circumstances, \\nit may be improper to plead undifferentiated facts against a corporate entity and its directors \\nand/or employees, particularly where there is an attempt to “pierce the corporate veil.” \\n[21] However, in this case, I see no issue with the pleadings. There is a live issue as to who the \\nparties to the contract are. The Statement of Claim clearly sets out the particulars of the \\nagreement and the nature of the alleged breach of the agreement. It alleges that the agreement \\nwas entered into by either Mr. Tiltack in his personal capacity and/or Mr. Tiltack on behalf \\nof his company MRC. The written unsigned contract at the core of the dispute directly gives \\nrise to this issue as it stipulates “MRC Sleep, by Colin Tiltack” as a signatory party. As well, \\nthe Statement of Claim pleads the fact that payments on the contract came from both Mr. \\nTiltack personally and MRC.  \\n[22] In these circumstances, there is nothing flawed about the pleadings. While at trial it will be \\nup to the plaintiff to prove who the contract was with, at this stage it cannot be said that the \\ntest for striking the claim as it relates to MRC has been met. Moreover, to the extent that the \\npleadings are crafted so as to prevent Mr. Tiltack from later taking the position that the \\ncontract was with “MRC Sleep” and not him, the concern is entirely valid. When offered the \\nopportunity to assure the plaintiff that this would not be the defence, counsel declined. \\nViewed in context, the defendants’ motion seems entirely tactical as opposed to substantive.  \\n[23] Lastly, I turn to addressing the submission that the claim of unjust enrichment as against \\nMRC should also be struck as the legal test for unjust enrichment cannot be established vis-\\nà-vis MRC. In short, the defendants argue that there are no pleaded facts revealing how MRC \\nbenefitted from the construction/renovation work performed by the plaintiff. Secondly, the \\ndefendants argue that juristic reasons including the remedy for breach of contract and resort \\nto the Construction Act would serve to bar resort to the doctrine of unjust enrichment. In this \\nregard, the defendants rely on Ciccocioppo Design/Build Inc. v. Gruppuso, 2017 ONSC \\n2012, at paras. 18-21.  \\n[24] While I agree that the plaintiff may face significant hurdles in establishing an unjust \\nenrichment claim against MRC, I am not satisfied that the pleadings should be struck at this \\nstage. Simply stated, the pleadings are not so flawed or lacking so as to meet the high \\nthreshold under Rule 21.01(1)(b).  \\n[25] In other words, assuming the facts pleaded are true, it is not plain and obvious that the claim \\nfor unjust enrichment will fail. In context, this issue would arise if the corporate defendant \\nis proven to be the sole party to the contract, in which case it is arguable that the principle of \\n2024 ONSC 1917 (CanLII)\\nPage 5 \\n \\n \\nunjust enrichment would apply in relation to the benefit received by the individual defendant. \\nThat said, the arguments advanced by the defendants may be more properly considered in \\nthe context of a summary judgment motion, once the action is defended and the evidence \\ndevelops. \\n[26] The motion is dismissed.  \\n[27] In terms of costs, I note that the defendants’ costs outline reveals costs totalling \\napproximately $8,900 all-inclusive on a partial indemnity basis. The plaintiff’s costs outline \\nreveals costs totalling approximately $7,000 all-inclusive on a partial indemnity basis and \\n$10,500 on a substantial indemnity basis.  \\n[28] I find that the costs incurred by the plaintiff are reasonable as measured against the costs \\nincurred by the defendants and in terms of the materials prepared in response to the issues \\nraised. \\n[29] I also find that this motion was needless and purely tactical. It could have been resolved \\ninstantly. Indeed, the plaintiff repeatedly offered to “cut” the corporate defendant if Mr. \\nTiltack would simply agree that he was the sole contracting party. Mr. Tiltack, through \\ncounsel who acts for both defendants, refused to do so and instead forced this motion wherein \\nhe essentially took the position that he was the sole contracting party.  \\n[30] In an era where the court resources are stretched to the limits, scarce court time should be \\nreserved for cases that present legitimate issues for determination. An objective and \\nreasonable observer would readily conclude that this motion had nothing to do with \\nlegitimate litigation goals. This is conduct that warrants a measure of costs in excess of \\npartial indemnity.  \\n[31] Having considered the relevant factors, including reasonableness and proportionality and \\nconsidering the nature of the defendant’s conduct which needlessly necessitated the motion, \\nI find that costs of $8,000 all-inclusive are appropriate. The costs are to be paid within 30 \\ndays.  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\nJ. Di Luca J.  \\n \\nDate: April 2, 2024 \\n2024 ONSC 1917 (CanLII)\\n',\n",

BALE J.:- \\nINTRODUCTION \\n[1] \\nCybercrime has become increasingly prevalent as commerce moves online. Its \\nproliferation has been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the use of cryptocurrency to \\nfacilitate and profit from crime. Because of unique challenges associated with investigating and \\nprosecuting offences using cryptocurrency, foreign criminal actors have increasingly profited \\nfrom Canadian victims while remaining beyond the reach of our criminal justice system. \\n[2] \\nIn the present case, the victim was tricked into purchasing and transferring Bitcoin worth \\napproximately $65,000 into digital wallets outside his control. Durham Regional Police Service \\ntraced a part of the Bitcoin into three digital wallets held on the Binance cryptocurrency \\nexchange. The issue on this application is whether a general warrant may be used to seize \\ncryptocurrency held on a third-party exchange. \\n[3] \\nIn March 2023, DRPS applied for a general warrant and related assistance order under ss. \\n487.01 and 487.02 of the Criminal Code. By means of the warrant and assistance order, police \\nsought to seize the subject cryptocurrency by compelling Binance to transfer it from the \\nsuspects’ wallets into a secure wallet held by DRPS. \\n[4] \\nUnder s. 487.01 of the Code, a judge may issue a warrant authorizing a peace officer to \\nuse any device or investigative technique or procedure, or do anything described in the warrant \\nthat would, if not authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure if, (a) the judge is \\nsatisfied that there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe an offence has been \\ncommitted and that information concerning the offence will be obtained, (b) the judge is satisfied \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 2 - \\n \\nthat it is in the best interests of justice to issue the warrant, and (c) there is no other provision \\nunder the Criminal Code or other Act of Parliament permitting the technique, procedure or \\ndevice or the doing of the thing. Under s. 487.02, the judge or justice who issues the warrant may \\norder a person to provide assistance, if the person’s assistance may reasonably be considered to \\nbe required to give effect to the warrant. \\n[5] \\nThe DRPS application was dismissed by Burstein J. of the Ontario Court of Justice. In \\ndismissing the application, he found that the application failed to satisfy all three of the \\npreconditions for issuing a general warrant.  \\n[6] \\nThe Attorney General for Ontario now applies for orders of certiorari and mandamus to \\nquash the application judge’s order dismissing the DRPS application, and to compel the Ontario \\nCourt of Justice to exercise its jurisdiction to issue the requested general warrant and assistance \\norder. The Attorney General argues that general warrants are the only available tool for police to \\nrecover cryptocurrency taken from Canadian victims by criminals outside the reach of our \\ncriminal justice system, and that in dismissing the warrant application, the application judge \\ncommitted jurisdictional and legal errors that justify the requested relief.  \\n[7] \\nWhile also addressing the narrower issue of whether the application judge erred by \\nrefusing to issue the proposed general warrant and assistance order, the Attorney General’s stated \\npurpose for bringing this application is to confirm, as a matter of law, “the continued availability \\nof general warrants as a method of seizing cryptocurrency from suspect accounts on third-party \\nexchanges – a critical investigative tool in the ongoing fight against cybercrime in this country.” \\nCrown counsel argues that this is an issue of national importance. \\n[8] \\nThe suspects in this case are unlikely to face prosecution in Canada. A production order \\nserved on Binance confirmed that all three are Nigerian citizens with Nigerian places of \\nresidence. \\n[9] \\nBecause it was unlikely that the suspects would take part in the proceedings (and they \\nhave not), I appointed amicus curiae to assist me in receiving full argument.  \\n[10] \\nFor the following reasons, I agree with Burstein J. that the DRPS application failed to \\nsatisfy all three of the preconditions for issuing a general warrant. Most importantly, I find that \\nwithin the meaning of s. 487.01(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, there are provisions in the Code, \\nother than general warrants, that provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting police to \\nseize cryptocurrency, and hold it in a secure wallet for return or forfeiture. In particular, I refer to \\nspecial warrants – digital assets (s. 462.321) and restraint orders (s. 462.33), combined with \\nmanagement orders (s. 462.331). \\n[11] \\nThe application will therefore be dismissed.  \\nAVAILABILITY AND SCOPE OF CERTIORARI REVIEW  \\n[12] \\nBefore explaining why I find there to be “other provisions” providing for the technique \\nsought to be used by the DRPS, I will deal briefly with the availability and scope of certiorari \\nreview.  \\n[13] \\nAlthough unaware of any certiorari applications relating to a refusal by a provincial court \\njudge to issue a general warrant, the Attorney General submits that such review should be \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 3 - \\n \\navailable, based upon the availability of certiorari review in relation to decisions concerning \\nother Criminal Code investigative devices, such as conventional search warrants and production \\norders. I agree. See textPlus Inc. (re) (2022), 163 O.R. (3d) 737, [2022] O.J. No. 4959, at paras. \\n38–48; R. v. Brown, 2015 ABQB 728, at para. 40; British Columbia (Attorney General) v. \\nBrecknell, 2018 BCCA 5; and R. v. Brown, 2019 ONSC 5032. \\n[14] \\nHowever, the question of the available scope of that review is more difficult. In the \\ncontext of criminal trial proceedings, certiorari is only available when the lower court commits \\njurisdictional error. A court will fall into jurisdictional error if it errs in its interpretation of a \\nstatute that is jurisdictional in nature, refuses to exercise its jurisdiction, or acts in breach of \\nprinciples of natural justice: R. v. Awashish, 2018 SCC 45, at paras. 20-24. \\n[15] \\nThe Attorney General argues that the scope of certiorari review of a refusal to grant an \\napplication for an order relating to a Criminal Code investigative tool should be broader, and \\nrequests a ruling that certiorari may be granted, based on an error of law alone, in the context of \\na provincial court’s dismissal of an application for a warrant or other investigative device. \\nHowever, given my conclusion that the application judge committed no error in declining to \\nissue the general warrant, it is unnecessary for me to consider this issue. \\nTHE APPLICATION JUDGE’S REASONS \\n[16] \\nReferring to the “no other provision” precondition in s. 487.01(1)(c) of the Code, the \\napplication judge found that the general warrant sought by the DRPS was aimed at recovering \\nproperty obtained by the commission of an offence, and that there were a variety of other “legal \\nmechanisms” that would have authorized them to do that. In particular, he held that a restraint \\norder under s. 462.33 of the Code would have allowed the Attorney General to apply for an order \\nprohibiting Binance from “disposing of, or otherwise dealing with, any interest in the property \\nspecified in the order.” He pointed out that even if it could be said that the cryptocurrency is not \\n“within a province”, s. 462.33(3.1) of the Code provides that “[a] restraint order may be issued \\nunder this section, in respect of property situated outside Canada.”  \\n[17] \\nThe application judge found that the materials filed by the DRPS in support of the \\ngeneral warrant would likely have satisfied the requirements for obtaining a restraint order under \\ns. 462.33. However, he concluded that even if there is “no other provision” authorizing the \\ntechnique, the appropriate remedy is for Parliament to address the problem, not the courts. \\n[18] \\nThe application judge noted that the Criminal Code allows police “to seek authorization \\nfor the seizure of property for a variety of reasons, such as to afford evidence of a crime, to \\nremove dangerous contraband from the public domain and to compensate victims for harms \\nsuffered”, and said that he was not satisfied that it would be “legally appropriate to seek a \\ngeneral warrant for the purpose of seizing suspected proceeds of crime.” \\nANALYSIS \\nCentral issue \\n[19] \\nThe central issue in this case is whether there are provisions of the Criminal Code or \\nother Act of Parliament, other than a general warrant and assistance order, that would provide for \\na warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique proposed by the DRPS.  \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 4 - \\n \\nThe technique proposed by the DRPS \\n[20] \\nThe first step in the analysis is to identify the proposed “technique, procedure or device to \\nbe used or the thing to be done.” For convenience, I will consolidate those terms and refer to \\nthem as the “technique”.  \\n[21] \\nThe technique proposed by the DRPS is variously described. For example, in the ITO, \\nDC Snow deposed that “[t]he general warrant will allow the police to seize the subject \\ncryptocurrency and facilitate its forfeiture as proceeds of crime or its return.” In argument, \\nCrown counsel described what the police sought to do was to “compel Binance to transfer the \\nsubject cryptocurrency into the direct and exclusive control of the police in order to facilitate a \\nfinal determination of lawful ownership under the court’s supervision.” The draft order which the \\napplication judge was asked to sign provided for the transfer of the subject cryptocurrency to a \\nsecure wallet held by the DRPS and required Binance to facilitate the transfer. \\nThe general warrant – s. 487.01 of the Code \\n[22] \\nGeneral warrants are provided for in s. 487.01 of the Criminal Code:  \\n487.01 (1) A provincial court judge, a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or \\na judge as defined in section 552 may issue a warrant in writing authorizing a peace \\nofficer to, subject to this section, use any device or investigative technique or procedure \\nor do any thing described in the warrant that would, if not authorized, constitute an \\nunreasonable search or seizure in respect of a person or a person’s property if \\n(a) the judge is satisfied by information on oath in writing that there are reasonable \\ngrounds to believe that an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament has \\nbeen or will be committed and that information concerning the offence will be \\nobtained through the use of the technique, procedure or device or the doing of the \\nthing; \\n(b) the judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration of justice \\nto issue the warrant; and \\n(c) there is no other provision in this or any other Act of Parliament that would \\nprovide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique, procedure or \\ndevice to be used or the thing to be done. \\n[23] \\nThis provision was introduced by Parliament in 1993 to fill any potential gaps in the \\navailability of judicial authorizations to conduct searches and seizures. The provision \\n“recognizes that Parliament cannot anticipate or imagine all investigative means or techniques \\nthat are or will become available to the police”: R. v. Ha, 2009 ONCA 340, at para. 26. \\n[24] \\nThe leading case on the availability of general warrants is R. v. TELUS Communications \\nCo., 2013 SCC 16. The question in Telus was whether the police were entitled to a general \\nwarrant or whether they required a “wiretap authorization” pursuant to Part VI of the Code.  \\n[25] \\nPart VI provides for the interception of private communications. Under s. 185, the \\nAttorney General, the Minister of Public Safety or a designated agent may apply for a wiretap \\nauthorization. In Ontario, the Crown agent is usually an assistant crown attorney or public \\nprosecutor designated for that purpose.  \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 5 - \\n \\n[26] \\nIn Telus, the police had obtained a general warrant and related assistance order under ss. \\n487.01 and 487.02 of the Criminal Code. The orders required Telus to provide the police with \\nstored text messages sent or received by two Telus subscribers, on a daily basis. Telus applied to \\nquash the general warrant arguing that the prospective daily acquisition of text messages would \\nrequire an authorization under Part VI of the Code. The application judge dismissed the \\napplication. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was held that the general warrant was \\ninvalid because the investigative technique that it authorized was substantively equivalent to \\nwhat would have been done pursuant to a Part VI authorization. \\n[27] \\nThe following principles emerge from the reasons in Telus: \\n\\uf0b7 section 487.01(1)(c) should be broadly construed to ensure that general warrants are not \\nused presumptively. This is to prevent circumvention of more specific or rigorous \\npreauthorization requirements (at para. 19); \\n\\uf0b7 the focus is on the actual substance of the investigative technique, not merely its formal \\ntrappings. The provision must be interpreted to afford the police the flexibility Parliament \\ncontemplated in creating the general warrant, while safeguarding against its misuse (at \\npara. 77); \\n\\uf0b7 there is a need for heightened judicial scrutiny where Parliament has provided an \\nauthorization for an investigative technique that is substantively equivalent to what the \\npolice seek but requires more onerous pre-conditions (at para. 77);  \\n\\uf0b7 courts must be careful to fill a legislative lacuna only where Parliament has actually \\nfailed to anticipate a particular search authorization. To do otherwise would chip away at \\nthe foundation that shapes the respective roles of the courts and Parliament in our system \\nof criminal justice when individual rights and freedoms are at stake (at para. 78); and \\n\\uf0b7 although the provision is broad and can capture almost any kind of investigative \\ntechnique or procedure, “history confirms that general warrants were to play a modest \\nrole affording the police a constitutionally sound path for investigative techniques that \\nParliament had not addressed” and are properly construed as “rearguard warrants of \\nlimited resort, not frontline warrants of general application” (at para. 93). \\nOther provisions that would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the \\ntechnique sought to be used by the DRPS in the present case \\n[28] \\nUnder Part XII.2 of the Criminal Code – entitled “Proceeds of Crime” - there are other \\nprovisions providing for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique sought to be \\nused by the DRPS in the present case. Part XII.2 provides for both restraint orders and special \\nwarrants – digital assets. Either may be combined with a management order.  \\nRestraint orders \\n[29] \\nRestraint orders which prohibit “any person from disposing of, or otherwise dealing with \\nany interest in, the property specified in the order” are available on application by the Attorney \\nGeneral where the judge is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that “there exists \\n… any property in respect of which an order of forfeiture may be made under subsection \\n462.37(1) or (2.01) or 462.38(2) in respect of a designated offence ….” Section 462.33(3.1) \\nprovides that restraint orders have extraterritorial jurisdiction, including outside of Canada. \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 6 - \\n \\n[30] \\nUnder s. 462.33(7), before a judge makes a restraint order, the judge “shall require the \\nAttorney General to give such undertakings as the judge considers appropriate with respect to the \\npayment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to (a) the making of an order in respect of \\nproperty situated within or outside Canada; and (b) the execution of an order in respect of \\nproperty situated within Canada. \\nSpecial warrant – digital assets \\n[31] \\nThe application judge based his decision on the availability of restraint orders to do what \\nthe police wanted to do, and the argument on the present application focused on the question of \\nwhether restraint orders, coupled with management orders, are substantively equivalent to \\ngeneral warrants for that purpose.  \\n[32] \\nHowever, in June 2023 (several months after the application judge dismissed the DRPS \\napplication), Parliament, presumably with knowledge of the challenges to law enforcement \\nposed by cryptocurrency, amended Part XII.2 of the Criminal Code to add s. 462.321, providing \\nfor the seizure, management, and disposition of digital assets, specifically including virtual \\ncurrency. The new section came into force on September 20, 2023, and provides: \\n462.321(1) If, on an application of the Attorney General, a judge is satisfied by \\ninformation on oath in Form 1, varied to suit the case, that there are reasonable grounds \\nto believe that any digital assets, including virtual currency, may be the subject of an \\norder of forfeiture made under subsection 462.37(1) or (2.01) or 462.38(2) in respect of a \\ndesignated offence alleged to have been committed within the province in which the \\njudge has jurisdiction, the judge may issue a warrant authorizing a person named in the \\nwarrant or a peace officer to \\n(a) search for the digital assets by using a computer program, as defined in subsection \\n342.1(2); and \\n(b) seize — including by taking control of the right to access — the digital assets, as \\nwell as any other digital assets found during that search that the person or peace \\nofficer believes, on reasonable grounds, may be the subject of such an order of \\nforfeiture. \\n[33] \\nUnder s. 462.321(5), a peace officer may, with the consent of the Attorney General, \\nreturn the seized property to the person lawfully entitled to its possession, if (a) the peace officer \\nis satisfied that there is no dispute as to who is lawfully entitled to possession of the seized \\nproperty; (b) the peace officer is satisfied that the continued detention of the seized property is \\nnot required for the purpose of forfeiture; and (c) the seized property is returned before a report \\nis filed with the court clerk under s. 462.321(4)(c). \\n[34] \\nUnder s. 462.321(7), before a judge issues a digital assets warrant, the judge “shall \\nrequire the Attorney General to give any undertakings that the judge considers appropriate with \\nrespect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to the issuance and execution of \\nthe warrant.” \\n[35] \\nCrown counsel argues that because digital assets warrants were not available at the time \\nof the DRPS application, those warrants could not have been taken into account by the \\napplication judge. While this is so, I could not be expected to grant the relief sought by the \\nAttorney General – an order of mandamus requiring the provincial court to issue a general \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 7 - \\n \\nwarrant – when, in the meantime, Parliament has provided for a new form of warrant which \\nspecifically deals with digital currency. \\n[36] \\nIn any event, the Attorney General’s position is that these digital assets warrants do not \\nprovide for the technique that the police wanted to use in this case, particularly in cases where \\nthe prospect of a domestic prosecution is unlikely. Crown counsel argues that these new warrants \\nare limited by all the same legal and practical challenges that affect the existing restraint and \\nmanagement provisions. It will therefore be convenient to deal with digital assets warrants and \\nrestraint orders together. \\nManagement orders \\n[37] \\nUnder s. 462.331 of the Code, on application of the Attorney General or of any other \\nperson with the consent of the Attorney General, the judge may, with respect to property seized \\nor restrained,  \\n \\n(a) appoint a person to take control of and to manage or otherwise deal with all or part of \\nthe property in accordance with the directions of the judge; and \\n(b) require any person having possession of that property to give possession of the \\nproperty to the person appointed to deal with the property. \\nThe Attorney General’s position with respect to digital assets warrants and restraint orders \\n[38] \\nThe Attorney General’s position is that digital assets warrants and restraint orders are not \\nsubstantively equivalent to general warrants for the purposes of seizing cryptocurrency under the \\ncontrol of a third-party exchange. In support of that position, Crown counsel raises a number of \\nobjections to the use of Part XII.2 applications for that purpose. She argues: \\n\\uf0b7 that unlike applications for general warrants which may be made by police, applications \\nfor digital assets warrants and restraint orders may be made by the Attorney General but \\nnot by police; \\n\\uf0b7 that unlike with general warrants, multiple applications are required under Part XII.2; and \\n\\uf0b7 that Part XII.2 applications are unavailable in the circumstances of this case because they \\nare limited to the restraint or seizure of any property in respect of which an order of \\nforfeiture may be made under ss. 462.37(1) or (2.01) or 462.38(2) of the Code. \\n[39] \\nEach of these objections may be answered by the simple observation that Parliament, in \\nproviding for the search and seizure of proceeds of crime, specifically including digital currency, \\nhas legislated the procedures for doing so, and that general warrants cannot be used to \\ncircumvent more specific or rigorous preauthorization requirements provided for by Parliament:  \\nTelus, at para. 19. However, I will go on to specifically address each of the Attorney General’s \\nobjections  \\nRequirement that Part XII.2 applications be made by the Attorney General \\n[40] \\nUnlike applications for general warrants which may be made by the police, applications \\nfor digital assets warrants and restraint orders may only be made by the Attorney General. Crown \\ncounsel argues that this difference is a substantive difference for the purposes of s. 487.01(1)(c). \\nShe concedes that the difference is police oversight by the Attorney General but argues that such \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 8 - \\n \\noversight is a key part of what makes Part XII.2 applications substantively different from general \\nwarrant applications. \\n[41] \\nHowever, as Amicus points out, the precondition in s. 487.01(1)(c) is not that there be no \\nother provision that would authorize a particular technique to be used by a peace officer; but \\nrather, that there be no other provision that would authorize the technique, period. Accordingly, \\non a plain reading of the subsection, the existence of an otherwise substantively equivalent \\ntechnique will be fatal to the application, whether it is an application that may be made by a \\npeace officer or not. \\n[42] \\nCrown counsel refers to the fact that the Attorney General and the police are separate and \\nindependent entities, and that in any given case, it would be open to the Attorney General to \\nrefuse to apply for a digital assets warrant or restraint and management orders that the police \\nwanted to obtain. She argues that it is not a sufficient equivalent to say that some other separate \\nand independent entity could bring a similar application but may or may not decide to do so. She \\nsays that there is no “police-led” alternative to a general warrant, for the purpose of bringing the \\nseized funds under the direct and exclusive control of the police, to be returned to the lawful \\nowner, under the court’s supervision. In other words, it is the Attorney General’s position that \\nthe police should be able to seize cryptocurrency on a third-party exchange, by means of a \\ngeneral warrant, even in situations where the Attorney General would not support such a seizure. \\n[43] \\nIn any event, as a practical matter, during an ongoing investigation, the Attorney General \\ndoes not act independently from the police. The police, in their investigative capacity, bring to \\nthe Crown’s attention the proceeds to be restrained and managed, and coordinate the application \\nwith the Crown. While Crown counsel, representing the Attorney General, oversees and submits \\nthe application, typically a police officer involved in the investigation swears the information to \\nobtain.  \\n[44] \\nIf Parliament has provided that certain types of searches or seizures should only be the \\nsubject of judicial authorization where the Attorney General is the applicant, then that was a \\ndecision Parliament made, just as Parliament decided that only an agent designated by the \\nMinister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, or the Attorney General, can apply for a \\nwiretap authorization under Part VI.  \\n[45] \\nCrown counsel further argues that applications for digital assets warrants and restraint \\norders are substantively different from general warrant applications, because they require the \\nAttorney General to give an undertaking with respect to costs and damages. However, the \\nrequirement of an undertaking reflects a policy decision made by Parliament. Parliament has \\ndecided that if things are to be seized as alleged proceeds of crime (specifically including virtual \\ncurrency), there must be oversight by the Attorney General, and that an undertaking must be \\ngiven with respect to damages and costs.  \\n[46] \\nThese safeguards demonstrate Parliament's intention that a higher degree of protection be \\navailable where proceeds of crime are seized, including digital currency. Part XII.2 includes \\nmore rigorous safeguards than other warrant provisions in the Code. In considering whether \\nseizure of cryptocurrency falls within Part XII.2, we must take this overall objective into \\naccount. The technical differences relied on by the Attorney General should not be allowed to \\ndefeat Parliament's intended protection of those from whom the state intends to seize property. \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 9 - \\n \\n[47] \\nThe decision in Telus illustrates the difficulty with Crown counsel’s argument. Where the \\npolice want to obtain evidence from a telecommunications server, they may obtain copies of \\nhistorical communications relying on conventional search warrants or production orders. \\nHowever, there is no specific statutory mechanism available to peace officers to apply for \\njudicial authorization if they want to intercept communications in real time or prospectively.  \\n[48] \\nThe fact that the police who had obtained the general warrant in Telus could not apply for \\na Part VI authorization was not a ground for validating the general warrant. In fact, at paras. 73-\\n76, Moldaver J. refers to the fact that only individuals designated by the Minister of Public \\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness or Attorney General may seek a Part VI authorization as \\none of several more onerous requirements that the police should not be able to avoid by use of a \\ngeneral warrant.  \\n[49] \\nCrown counsel argues that the Attorney General does not take the position that police can \\nuse general warrants to access powers that Parliament has specifically reserved to the Attorney \\nGeneral. She argues that while under Part VI, Parliament has provided that only a wiretap agent \\ncan apply for a warrant, in the present case, the police are “seeking to do something that they are, \\nin effect, already able to do.” She argues that police can apply under s. 487 for a conventional \\nsearch warrant to seize alleged proceeds of crime such as a bag of cash (where those proceeds \\nare in a building, receptacle or place), and that it is only the intangible nature of cryptocurrency \\nthat takes it outside the scope of a s. 487 warrant. While it is true that police often come upon \\nand seize proceeds of crime while executing conventional search warrants, they do so pursuant to \\ns. 489 of the Code which provides that a person executing a warrant may, in addition to the \\nthings mentioned in the warrant, seize any thing found that the person reasonably believes has \\nbeen obtained by the commission of an offence. However, if the purpose of the search of a \\nbuilding, receptacle or place is to seize alleged proceeds of crime for potential forfeiture, an \\napplication by the Attorney General for a special warrant under s. 462.32 (1) of Part XII.2 is \\nrequired.  \\nRequirement of multiple orders \\n[50] \\nCrown counsel argues that unlike general warrant applications, Part XII.2 applications do \\nnot provide for a single judicial order, and that three separate orders are required: seizure or \\nrestraint, management, and then the ultimate forfeiture or return of the property. There are two \\nbasic problems with this argument. \\n[51] \\nFirst, even if additional orders were required under Part XII.2, that would be what \\nParliament has provided where the police seek to take control of proceeds of crime. The fact that \\nthe mechanics of obtaining an order allowing the police to take control of the cryptocurrency \\nmay be different or more onerous under Part XII.2 does not allow the police to avoid a procedure \\nthey dislike and proceed by way of a general warrant application. \\n[52] \\nSecond, in the present case, police sought a general warrant under s. 487.01 and an \\nassistance order under 487.02 in one application. There is no reason why, on a Part XII.2 \\napplication, a restraint order or a digital assets warrant, and a management order, could not \\nsimilarly be obtained on a single application. \\n[53] \\nCrown counsel argues that even if a restraint order or a digital assets warrant, and a \\nmanagement order were obtained on a single application, Part XII.2 applications are not \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 10 - \\n \\nsubstantively equivalent to general warrants because forfeiture or return cannot take place \\nimmediately following execution of the digital assets warrant or restraint order, and management \\norder. She argues that the fact that an application for forfeiture or return would have to be made \\nseparately, gives rise to a potential for significant delay in disposing of the seized proceeds.  \\n[54] \\nHowever, this argument is at odds with another argument made by Crown counsel, \\nnamely, the argument that the police wanted to seize the funds “to bring them into the criminal \\njustice system, so that a court may dispose of them to their lawful owner, pursuant to the \\ncomprehensive inter partes regime set out in sections 489.1 and 490 of the Code.”  \\n[55] \\nThe difficulty with the argument is that under s. 490 of the Code, further orders would in fact \\nbe required for the forfeiture or return of the cryptocurrency. While it is true that under s. 489.1, a \\npeace officer may, without a further order, return the thing seized to the person lawfully entitled to its \\npossession where the peace officer is satisfied that (i) there is no dispute as to who is lawfully \\nentitled to possession; and (ii) the continued detention of the thing seized is not required for the \\npurposes of any investigation or a preliminary inquiry, trial or other proceeding, a similar disposition \\nis available where the seizure is made by means of a digital assets warrant. Under s. 462.321(5) of \\nthe Code, a peace officer or a person acting on their behalf may, with the written consent of the \\nAttorney General, cause the seized property to be returned to the person lawfully entitled to its \\npossession, if (a) the peace officer is satisfied that there is no dispute as to who is lawfully entitled to \\npossession; (b) the peace officer is satisfied that the continued detention of the seized property is not \\nrequired for the purpose of forfeiture; and (c) the seized property is returned before a report is filed \\nwith the clerk of the court. \\nRequirement that property to be seized be property in respect of which an order of forfeiture may \\nbe made under subsection 462.37(1) or (2.01) or 462.38(2) \\n[56] \\nUnder ss. 462.321 and 462.33 of the Code, one of the preconditions for issuing digital \\nassets warrants and restraint orders is that the issuing judge be satisfied that there are reasonable \\ngrounds to believe that the property to be seized or restrained may be the subject of an order of \\nforfeiture under ss. 462.27(1) or (2.01) or 462.38(2) of the Code.  \\n[57] \\nThe Attorney General’s position is that in the circumstances of this case, and typically in \\ncryptocurrency cases involving foreign suspects, the procedures in Part XII.2 are not available, \\nbecause a forfeiture order may only issue upon the laying of charges or after a finding of guilt in \\na successful domestic prosecution. Because in cryptocurrency cases suspects are generally \\nbeyond the reach of the Canadian judicial system, Crown counsel argues that a restraint order is \\nunavailable as a matter of law, because the Attorney General will be unable to establish grounds \\nfor belief that “an order of forfeiture may be made.” \\n[58] \\nIn making this argument, Crown counsel appears to interpret ss. 462.321 and 462.33 as \\nrequiring reasonable grounds to believe that an order of forfeiture will be made. However, in my \\nview, property “may be the subject of an order of forfeiture” where there are reasonable grounds \\nto believe that the property is proceeds of crime obtained through the commission of a \\ndesignated offence, and that it is not necessary that there be reasonable grounds to believe that an \\norder of forfeiture will be made. I say this because there are dispositions other than forfeiture that \\nproperty seized under ss. 462.321 and 462.33 may be made. For example, under s. 462.43(1), on \\napplication by the Attorney General or any person having an interest in the property or on the \\njudge’s own motion, in the prescribed circumstances, the court may revoke the restraint order, \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 11 - \\n \\norder the property to be returned to the person from whom it was taken or order that it be \\nreturned to another person lawfully entitled to its possession. \\n[59] \\nIn addition, although the Attorney General is correct that forfeiture orders under ss. \\n462.37(1) and 462.37(2.01) require a finding of guilt, in cases where the suspect cannot be \\nbrought to justice in Canada, forfeiture may be available under s. 462.38 without a finding of \\nguilt. \\n[60] \\nWhere an information has been laid in respect of a designated offence, section 462.38(2) \\nprovides that upon application of the Attorney General, the judge shall order forfeiture, if the \\njudge is satisfied that (a) the property is, beyond a reasonable doubt, proceeds of crime, (b) the \\nproperty was obtained through the commission of a designated offence in respect of which \\nproceedings were commenced, and (c) the accused charged with the offence has died or \\nabsconded.  \\n[61] \\nFor the purposes of s. 462.38, an accused will be deemed to have absconded, if (a) an \\ninformation has been laid, (b) a warrant for the arrest of the person has been issued, and (c) \\nreasonable attempts to arrest the person have been unsuccessful during six months, or “in the \\ncase of a person who is not or never was in Canada, the person cannot be brought within that \\nperiod to the jurisdiction in which the warrant or summons was issued.”  \\n[62] \\nAccordingly, the requirement that the property to be seized or restrained be property “in \\nrespect of which an order of forfeiture may be made” does not put digital assets warrants or \\nrestraint orders beyond the reach of the Attorney General in cases where foreign suspects cannot \\nbe brought into Canada. \\n[63] \\nWith respect to s. 462.38, Crown counsel argues that in cases involving foreign suspects, \\nit is unlikely that an information would be laid. But why is that? Parliament has made specific \\nprovisions for the forfeiture of proceeds of crime, including digital currency, in the possession of \\npersons who are not or never were in Canada. Proceeds of crime in the possession of such \\npersons is property in respect of which an order of forfeiture may be made, and in swearing the \\naffidavit in support of the application, the deponent may rely on ss. 462.37(1) and 462.38(2) in \\nthe alternative: Laroche, 2002 SCC 72, at para. 37.  \\nConclusion on the “no other provision” precondition \\n[64] \\nOn the facts of this case, when one cuts through form and looks at the substance of the \\nsearch that the DRPS sought to conduct, I conclude that the application judge properly refused to \\nissue the general warrant, because the investigative technique it would authorize was \\nsubstantively equivalent to what could be done pursuant to a Part XII.2 authorization. In \\nparticular, digital assets warrants are tailor-made for the seizure of cryptocurrency held on a \\nthird-party cryptocurrency exchange. \\nWhether the proposed procedure will furnish “information concerning the offence” (s. \\n487.01(a)), and whether issuing the general warrant would be in the best interests of the \\nadministration of justice (s. 487.01(b)) \\n[65] \\nWhile my finding that there are other provisions in the Criminal Code that would provide \\nfor a warrant or order permitting the technique for which the DRPS sought a general warrant is \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 12 - \\n \\nsufficient for the disposition of this application, I will briefly address the “information \\nconcerning the offence” and “best interests of justice” preconditions. \\nInformation concerning the offence \\n[66] \\nThe application judge was not satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to believe that \\n“information concerning the offence” would be obtained through the use of the general warrant \\ntechnique proposed by the police.  \\n[67] \\nCrown counsel argues that that the transferring of the subject cryptocurrency from the \\ntarget addresses to a police-controlled wallet would represent a confirmation by Binance that the \\nalleged proceeds of crime were, in fact, controlled by the suspects. I disagree and see no basis \\nupon which to infer that the transfer would tell police anything about the offence itself – how it \\nwas committed or who committed it. Rather, the transfer would show nothing more than that \\nthere was money in the target accounts, that Binance had complied with its undertaking to freeze \\nthe accounts, and that it complied with the general warrant and assistance order. \\nBest interests of justice \\n[68] \\nIt is only where the “no other provision” question is answered in the negative that the \\ninquiry shifts to whether issuance of the warrant is in the best interests of the administration of \\njustice: Telus, at para. 96. To illustrate the point, it could not be in the best interests of the \\nadministration of justice to allow police to avoid the rigours of an application for a digital assets \\nwarrant or restraint order where those authorizations permit the technique or procedure which the \\npolice seek to use. \\nEnforceability of Criminal Code warrants and orders against multijurisdictional entities \\n[69] \\nBinance’s position is that the use of a general warrant is not appropriate where police \\nseek to take control of cryptocurrency located in a wallet held on a third-party public exchange.  \\n[70] \\nIn support of its position, Binance makes two general submissions. First, while having no \\ncomment relating to the tracing method used by DRPS in the present case, Binance argues that as \\na general matter, block chain tracing is subject to uncertainty and cannot confidently be relied \\nupon to identify that the correct wallet or account is being targeted. Second, Binance argues that \\nss 489.1 and 490 of the Code do not provide affected account holders with an adequate remedy. \\n[71] \\nHowever, the issue of greatest concern to Binance is the question of enforceability of \\nCriminal Code warrants and orders against multijurisdictional entities. \\n[72] \\nBinance argues that the seizure of cryptocurrency on a third-party exchange is, in effect, a \\nseizure order in rem. Counsel argues that on any jurisdictional analysis, the subject \\ncryptocurrency in this case is not situated in Canada, because Binance is domiciled in the \\nCayman Islands, and the Binance account holders are resident in Nigeria. Binance’s position is \\nthat the correct approach to making a seizure in such circumstances – one that is appropriately \\nrespectful of international comity – would be to make a mutual legal assistance request to the \\nstate in which the property in question resides.  \\n[73] \\nPrior to the hearing, counsel agreed that the application should be bifurcated with the \\nquestion of enforceability of a general warrant and assistance order, in the circumstances of this \\n2024 ONSC 1928 (CanLII)\\n- 13 - \\n \\ncase, to be argued, if necessary, following determination of the question of whether a general \\nwarrant and assistance order should otherwise issue. As I have found that a general warrant is not \\navailable to the police in this case, the Attorney General may or may not proceed with an \\napplication under Part XII.2 of the Code.  \\n[74] \\nThe Attorney General has agreed to notify Binance if an application under Part XII.2 is \\nmade. If such an application is made and the parties wish to argue the issue of jurisdiction, they \\nmay contact the trial coordinator to make the necessary arrangements. \\nDISPOSITION \\n[75] \\nFor the reasons given, the application is dismissed. \\n“S.T.

(“Cedarhill”) requests a declaration that \\nSchedule Y5 (“Y5”) of a subdivision agreement (the “subdivision agreement”) registered on title \\nto its property (the “property”) is ultra vires, invalid, and unenforceable. The specific obligation \\nin Y5 that Cedarhill opposes mandates the continued operation of a golf course on the property in \\nperpetuity. \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n[2] \\nThe respondent, City of Ottawa (the “City”), contends that the subdivision agreement, \\nincluding Y5, is enforceable against Cedarhill and the property to which it applies, just like any \\nother subdivision agreement in the province of Ontario. \\nBrief Background  \\n[3]      On May 5, 1980, Cedpar Properties Inc. (“Cedpar”), the then-owner of the property \\nand additional lands, entered into the subdivision agreement with the Township of Nepean \\n(“Nepean”), which was registered on title to the property and surrounding lands.  \\n[4]      Cedarhill is the successor in title to Cedpar, having acquired the property on June 19, \\n1981.  \\n[5]    Cedarhill owns the property known municipally as 56 Cedarhill Drive, Ottawa, on \\nwhich the golf course currently operates.  \\n[6]      The City is the successor to Nepean through an amalgamation in 2001. \\n[7]      Cedarhill contends that subdivision agreements are planning instruments, rather than \\ncommercial contracts. To that end, it argues that the effect of Y5 is to hold it responsible in \\nperpetuity for the financial burden of operating an unprofitable golf course for the City’s \\nbenefit. This is despite the availability of other appropriate and reasonable uses of the \\nproperty, which would constitute good planning.  \\n[8]     The City asserts that a subdivision agreement is a contract and is to be interpreted \\naccording to normal principles of contractual interpretation. Thus, the City argues that \\nCedarhill seeks the court’s assistance to deprive it of its ability to enforce Y5, because \\nCedarhill now considers it more advantageous to re-develop the golf course. \\nIssues      \\n[9] \\nThe issues to be determined on this application are as follows: \\n1. Whether Nepean had the statutory authority to enter into the subdivision agreement, \\nincluding Y5, with Cedpar in 1980. \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n2. Whether the subdivision agreement is enforceable as a contract. Alternatively, is it a \\nplanning instrument that should remain open to changes in law and policy.  \\n3. Whether the subdivision agreement binds Cedarhill as a successor in title.  \\n4. Whether Y5 creates contingent interests in land. \\n5. Whether Y5 amounts to a constructive taking.    \\nEvidence  \\n[10] \\nAt the time of execution of the subdivision agreement, subdivision control and the approval \\nof plans of subdivision were governed by The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 349, as amended (the \\n“1970 Planning Act”).1 The process of obtaining approval to register a plan of subdivision in 1980 \\nwas similar to the current process. \\n[11] \\nAn applicant would submit an application for approval of a draft plan of subdivision (a \\n“draft plan”) for review by the relevant approval authority.2 That approval authority was permitted \\nto impose conditions on the approval of the draft plan.3 The statute provided that either a \\nmunicipality or an approval authority could enter into agreements with the owner “imposed as a \\ncondition to the approval of a plan of subdivision”.4  \\n[12] \\nIf an owner was not satisfied with any of the imposed conditions, including the terms of an \\nagreement imposed as a condition of approval, it could refer the matter to what was then the \\nOntario Municipal Board (the “OMB”) at any time before the draft plan was finally approved.5 \\nThe final approval of a draft plan for registration would occur once the approval authority was \\nsatisfied that the conditions “have been or will be fulfilled”.6   \\n[13] \\nIn 1980, the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton (the “Region”) was the approval \\nauthority for Cedpar’s subdivision plan. Historical records demonstrate, however, that Nepean, as \\nthe local municipality where the subdivision lands were located, was involved throughout the \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 See 1970 Planning Act, s. 29(2)(a). \\n2 1970 Planning Act, ss. 33(1), 33(3)-(4). \\n3 1970 Planning Act, s. 33(5). \\n4 1970 Planning Act, s. 33(6). \\n5 1970 Planning Act, s. 33(7). \\n6 1970 Planning Act, s. 33(14).   \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nmulti-year process of reviewing Cedpar’s development application, including developing \\nconditions of draft plan approval and negotiating the terms of the subdivision agreement to be \\nentered into by Nepean and Cedpar as a condition of approval. \\n[14] \\nIn 1974, Cedpar proposed the development of estate lots surrounding an existing golf \\ncourse in a draft plan of subdivision including approximately 100 residential lots and the golf \\ncourse lands. As early as October 17, 1974, Nepean’s Planning Board emphasized that the \\nretention of the existing golf course was of “utmost importance”, and “final approval [of the \\nproposed development] will be subject to a satisfactory resolution to the golf course retention.” \\n[15] \\nOn October 28, 1974, Nepean’s Council passed a resolution approving Cedpar’s \\nconceptual plan for the proposed subdivision, subject to resolution of issues including “the legal \\nmethods required to ensure the continued operation of the golf course.” \\n[16] \\nOn November 10, 1977, Nepean’s Planning Board again reviewed Cedpar’s proposed plan \\nof subdivision. Cedpar’s representative in attendance advised the Planning Board that “the owners \\nwere agreeable to keeping the golf course in perpetuity.” The minutes state the following: \\nReeve Haydon stated that he personally was not prepared to consider \\napproval of the development unless the continued existence of the \\ngolf course was guaranteed. [Cedpar’s representative] replied that \\nthere was no conflict in this regard. \\n[17] \\nThe Planning Board then voted to support the proposed plan of subdivision, subject to the \\nresolution of three matters to Nepean’s satisfaction, including “retention of the golf course.” \\n[18] \\nOn March 16, 1978, Nepean’s Planning Board supported Cedpar’s updated development \\nconcept, for “103 lots clustered around the golf course”, and moved to submit the revised plans \\nwith Nepean’s comments to the Region. The minutes state that Nepean’s solicitor was to be \\ncontacted regarding “the best means of ensuring that the golf course is retained in perpetuity.” \\n[19] \\nOn August 17, 1978, Nepean’s Planning Board considered and made revisions to proposed \\nconditions of final plan approval and moved for those revised conditions to be submitted to the \\nRegion. The City’s archives include a document titled “Township of Nepean Conditions - Final \\nPlan Approval - Cedarhill Properties Inc. - 06T - 75509”, which includes handwritten annotations \\nthat appear to state “Revised as per Planning Board August 17, 1978”. The fifth condition in that \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\ndocument requires “[t]hat the Owner enter into an agreement with the Township of Nepean to \\nensure the operation of the golf course in perpetuity to the satisfaction of the Township of Nepean”. \\n[20] \\nThe City is unable to confirm if this document represents the final version of the conditions \\nof approval required of Cedpar,7 however, minutes from a subsequent Planning Board meeting \\ncorroborate that “it was a condition of draft plan approval that the matter of the permanent retention \\nof the golf course be resolved to the City’s satisfaction.” \\n[21] \\nOn August 29, 1978, the Region’s Planning Committee considered Cedpar’s subdivision \\napplication and moved that it be approved, as amended.  \\n[22] \\nOn December 13, 1979, Nepean’s Planning Board was provided a draft agreement that had \\nbeen prepared by Cedpar’s solicitor, which remained subject to review by the City’s solicitor. \\n[23] \\nOn January 10, 1980, Nepean’s Council held a special meeting for the purpose of \\nconsidering “the acceptance of a special schedule to the subdivision agreement for the Cedarhill \\nSubdivision for the purpose of ensuring the continued use of the golf course lands”. For the stated \\npurpose of expediting the process, at that meeting Council authorized the Mayor and Clerk to \\nexecute the subdivision agreement incorporating said special schedule on behalf of Nepean, \\nsubject to any revisions recommended by the City’s solicitor. \\n[24] \\n On March 19, 1980, Cedpar and Nepean signed the subdivision agreement, and thereafter \\nthe Subdivision Plan was registered as Plan 4M-278. \\n[25] \\nOn May 15, 1980, the subdivision agreement was registered on title to all the lands forming \\npart of the Subdivision Plan, including the golf course lands, as Instrument LT233955. The \\nsubdivision agreement specifies the following: \\n(a) \\nAll of the Schedules, including Y5 (Special Provisions for Cedarhill Golf Course), \\nare “an integral part of the Agreement”;8  \\n                                                 \\n \\n7 This is due to the dates identified in the document as compared to the registered Subdivision Plan. Clause 1 of the \\ndocument states: “That approval applies to the attached draft plan of subdivision certified by George D. Annis, O.L.S. \\ndated September 2, 1975 and as revised on May 20, 1977 and April 14, 1978”, whereas the Subdivision Plan is dated \\nJuly 10, 1979. \\n8 Subdivision agreement, cl. 2.  \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n(b) \\nIt is binding upon the parties and all their successors and assigns;9 and \\n(c) \\nAll covenants and agreements “assumed by or imposed upon the owner are deemed \\nto be covenants which run with and bind the lands [t]herein described”.10 \\n[26] \\nCedpar had the statutory right to challenge any conditions of approval, including the terms \\nof Y5, to the OMB pursuant to s. 33(7) of the 1970 Planning Act. It did not do so. As indicated in \\nNepean’s Planning Committee minutes, Cedpar was “agreeable to keeping the golf course in \\nperpetuity”. \\n[27] \\nOn June 19, 1981, Cedarhill acquired the golf course lands for $1. Since that time, Cedarhill \\nhas complied with the subdivision agreement and has operated the Cedarhill Golf and Country \\nClub, a private members’ golf course, on the golf course lands. \\n[28] \\nThe stated intention of Y5 is to enable Nepean “to act, if necessary” to ensure the \\n“continue[d] operation of ‘the golf course lands’ as a golf course operation or for such other \\nsuitable recreational use as may exist from time to time.”11 Clause 1 of Y5 confirms the owner’s \\nobligation is to “at all times operate the golf course in a good and businesslike manner to a standard \\nreasonably comparable to the current standard of operation of the golf course.”  \\n[29] \\nThat provision also grants the City a “step-in” remedy, should the owner fail to operate the \\ngolf course in such a manner. The remedy relies on the license, granted in the first paragraph of \\nY5, to enter specified parts of the golf course lands “for the purpose of operating and maintaining \\nthe said golf course” (the “License”). Both are defined terms in Y5: \\na) “operate” […] – to organize, supervise and regulate the use of the \\ngolf course inclusive of the establishment and collection of fees for \\nthe playing of golf, \\nb) “maintain” […] – to organize, supervise and regulate the repair \\nand the keeping up of the golf course in a satisfactory state for the \\nplaying of golf together with the correction and rectification of \\ndeficiencies as hereinafter defined. \\n                                                 \\n \\n9 Subdivision agreement, cl. 70. \\n10 Subdivision agreement, cl. 70. \\n11 Y5, Preamble.  \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\n[30] \\nThe License is limited to entering and occupying “any and all fairways, tees and greens, \\nparking lot, pro shop and golf club storage shop, and maintenance sheds”. Y5 excludes “club house \\nlands, club house proper, pool, driving range, and adjacent grounds and patios” from the License.12 \\n[31] \\nClause 1 requires the City to deliver notice of potential deficiencies and provides a 30-day \\ncure period in favour of the owner, failing which the City “shall be free to enter the golf course \\nlands described above as a licensee, and to correct and rectify the deficiencies and to operate a golf \\ncourse in order to permit the continued playing of the game of golf.”  The step-in remedy continues \\nuntil the default is cured. \\n[32] \\nClause 1 specifies that the City is to have “exclusive possession” of the identified portions \\nof the golf course lands for the purpose of operating the golf course while exercising the License. \\nThe purpose of this specification is further clarified within cl. 2, which confirms that while in \\ndefault, Cedarhill “shall not have the right to participate in any way in the golf course operation or \\nto participate in any way in the use of the golf course lands during the golf season”.   \\n[33] \\nAccording to cl. 4, these same provisions operate if the owner voluntarily elects to notify \\nthe City of its intent to abandon the maintenance of the golf course.  \\n[34] \\nY5 does not contemplate the conveyance of the golf course lands to the City.   \\n[35] \\nConspicuously, the parties expressly contemplated a scenario where “the continuing \\noperation of the lands for the purpose of playing golf is not commercially viable”.13 As set out in \\ncl. 3, the parties agreed that where the City exercises its right to operate and maintain the golf \\ncourse, and determines continued golf course operations is not commercially viable, the City could \\n“effect a change of use of the lands”, provided the following: \\na) The proposed use maintains the subject lands as open space and \\ncomplies with the zoning by-law then in force; and \\nb) written notice is given of the City’s intention to change the use to \\nthe owner and all mortgagees setting out specifically the use \\nproposed by the City; and \\n                                                 \\n \\n12 Y5, Preamble.  \\n13 Y5, cl. 3. \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nc) sixty days have elapsed from the date of service of the Notice \\nwithout the owner or a mortgagee curing its default hereunder. \\n[36] \\nHaving received notice of an intended change of use, Cedarhill or any mortgagee could opt \\nto resume the maintenance of the golf course or, in the alternative, pay any outstanding operation \\nand maintenance charges and taxes and furnish an undertaking to the City to operate the lands in \\naccordance with the proposed changed use. In the latter scenario, the City would be obliged to \\nrelease Cedarhill from any golf-related obligations in the agreement and vacate the lands.  \\n[37] \\nFinally, cl. 8 identifies that Y5 may be amended or altered by Cedarhill and the City “as \\nthey may agree”. This provides an alternative mechanism by which Cedarhill could stop operating \\na golf course, with the City’s agreement.14 \\nAnalysis \\nDid Nepean have the statutory authority to enter into the subdivision agreement, including Y5, \\nwith Cedpar in 1980?  \\n[38] \\nCedarhill argues that the subdivision agreement is an ultra vires attempt by the City \\n(initially Nepean) to circumvent the limitation on the amount of land that can be dedicated for a \\npublic recreational purpose through a subdivision agreement. To that end, Cedarhill asserts that \\nY5 is de facto a dedication of land for a park or public recreational purpose. Although there has \\nbeen no conveyance of land to the City, the subdivision agreement operates on the threat of \\nexclusive possession of the golf course by the City if Cedarhill does not continue to operate a golf \\ncourse to the City’s standards. It also stipulates that all costs of operation incurred by the City, if \\nit takes possession of the golf course, are collectable against Cedarhill. In this way, Cedarhill \\nargues that Nepean did not have the statutory authority to enter into the subdivision agreement, \\nincluding Y5, with Cedpar in 1980. I see no merit in this argument.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n14 The clause specifies that “no concurrence therein shall be required of anyone save and except any mortgagees”.  \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\n[39] \\nNepean had the statutory authority to execute the subdivision agreement on March 19, \\n1980, pursuant to s. 33(6) of the 1970 Planning Act. That statute expressly authorized \\nmunicipalities to enter into agreements as a condition to the approval of a draft plan: \\nSubdivision agreements \\n33(6) Every municipality and the Minister may enter into agreements \\nimposed as a condition to the approval of a plan of subdivision and any \\nsuch agreement may be registered against the land to which it applies and \\nthe municipality or the Minister, as the case may be, shall be entitled to \\nenforce the provisions thereof against the owner and, subject to the \\nprovisions of The Registry Act and The Land Titles Act, any and all \\nsubsequent owners of the land. \\n[40] \\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that the Planning Act grants a municipality \\nthe statutory authority to enter into subdivision agreements.15 The Ontario Court of Appeal \\nimplicitly affirmed this authority is contained within the 1970 Planning Act, specifically.16   \\n[41] \\nThe City argues that subdivision agreements are of fundamental importance to this \\nProvince’s land planning process. I agree. By requiring a developer to submit to the law of contract, \\nsubdivision agreements give municipalities an enforceable mechanism for ensuring compliance \\nwith conditions of approval following registration of a plan of subdivision.17 Such mechanisms are \\nthe necessary corollary to provisions of the 1970 Planning Act which permit the approval of a draft \\n                                                 \\n \\n15 Beaver Valley Developments Ltd. v.

They can appeal to the specialized tribunal \\n(formerly the OMB, now the Ontario Land Tribunal) at any time before a draft plan is finally \\napproved.19 However, once a developer enters into a subdivision agreement, the law of contract \\ngoverns and it is no longer possible to challenge such an agreement on the basis that it goes beyond \\nwhat a municipality may be entitled to impose as a condition of approval. As observed by the \\nSupreme Court of Canada in Pacific National Investments Ltd. v. Victoria (City): \\nIn many cases, no doubt, municipalities make demands that are not strictly \\nauthorized and developers do what they are asked to do because in the end \\nthey get the [planning] they want. There is no suggestion that in the \\nordinary case such arrangements should be unwound […].20 \\n[43] \\nIn response to Cedarhill’s specific claim that Y5 is de facto a dedication of land for a \\npark or public recreational purpose in excess of 5 percent, I note that in Laurentian Heights Ltd., \\nRe, the OMB dealt with an appeal against a condition of approval that would have required the \\ndedication of 38 percent of the lands in a subdivision as parkland, prior to the final approval and \\nregistration of the plan of subdivision. The OMB held that “while the Act specifies that a 5% \\nparkland dedication may be imposed by an approval authority, there is nothing to preclude the \\nparties from agreeing to additional parkland dedication which is the case here.”21  \\n                                                 \\n \\n18 1970 Planning Act, s. 33(14). \\n19 1970 Planning Act, s. 33(7). \\n20 2004 SCC 75, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 575, at para. 32. \\n21 2012 CarswellOnt 8321 (O.M.B.), at paras. 1, 32, 36. \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\nIs the subdivision agreement enforceable as a contract? Alternatively, is it a planning \\ninstrument that should remain open to changes in law and policy? \\n[44] \\nCedarhill asserts that “[s]ubdivision agreements are planning instruments, rather than \\nstandard commercial contracts,” such that “subdivision agreements should remain open to changes \\nin law and policy.” I do not agree.  \\n[45] \\nFirst, apart from arguing by analogy that subdivision agreements and site plan agreements \\nshould be viewed similarly, Cedarhill cites no authority that subdivision plans should be “treated \\nin a comparable manner under the law.” Second, this court has repeatedly concluded that a \\nsubdivision agreement is a contract and is to be interpreted according to normal principles of \\ncontractual interpretation.22 As Goldstein J. said in Caledon (Town) v. Waterstone Properties \\nCorp., “Ultimately, the normal principles of contractual interpretation must apply. A subdivision \\nagreement is a contract and will be interpreted according to contractual principles”.23 \\nDoes the subdivision agreement bind Cedarhill as a successor in title? \\n[46] \\nCedarhill argues that because Y5 contains positive obligations, at common law it is not \\nenforceable against it as a successor in title to the golf course lands.   \\n[47] \\nThe nature of subdivision agreements is such that many if not most of the covenants are \\npositive obligations. Moreover, there are a number of statutory exceptions to the rule that positive \\ncovenants do not bind successors in title. The Ontario Court of Appeal has found that s. 51(26) of \\nthe current Planning Act24 is a specific statutory exception to the common law rule that positive \\ncovenants do not bind successors in title.25 In this case, Y5 has been registered on title to the golf \\ncourse lands and, by operation of statute, it is therefore, in my view, binding on any and all \\n                                                 \\n \\n22 Caledon (Town) v.

Any other interpretation would undermine the protection \\nenvisioned by these provisions in the Planning Act. Thus, I find that Cedarhill is bound as a \\nsuccessor in title to the golf course lands. \\nDoes Y5 create contingent interests in land?  \\n[48] \\nCedarhill argues that any contingent interests in land created by the subdivision agreement \\nin 1980 must have vested by the year 2001. Otherwise, the interests are void for remoteness.  \\nCedarhill asserts that Y5 created a series of contingent interests in land in 1980 when it was \\nexecuted and none of these interests have vested to date. These include the following: (1) \\npossession and operation of the golf course; (2) registration of a lien against the land; (3) right to \\nenter upon and make use of the land during the off-season; and (4) Cedarhill’s right to reassume \\npossession. I disagree.  \\n[49] \\nFirst, the rule against perpetuities has no application in this case, as it is a rule applicable \\nto contingent interests in land that fail to vest within the perpetuity period. It does not apply to \\ncontractual rights that simply involve land.26  \\n[50] \\nSecond, in my view, the terms of Y5 are clear: the City has the right to enter the golf course \\nlands as a licensee. Y5 reiterates on six occasions that the City’s right is one of a licensee.   \\n[51] \\nA license is a purely contractual interest: \\nA licence, essentially, is a contractual right to use another’s land, \\nbut that is not an ownership interest in land. A licence is the grant of \\nauthority to enter upon another’s land for an agreed purpose where \\nsuch entry would otherwise be a trespass and, therefore, the \\n                                                 \\n \\n26 Canadian Long Island Petroleums Ltd. et al v.

[emphasis added]27 \\n[52] \\nThird, Cedarhill’s assertion that the Court of Appeal’s decision in ClubLink is applicable \\nto this case is ill-founded, for the following reasons. The Court of Appeal’s analysis focused on \\nthe proper interpretation of two contractual provisions: one that required the conveyance of certain \\nlands to the City “[i]n the event that [ClubLink] desires to discontinue the operation of the golf \\ncourse and it can find no other persons to acquire or operate it” (emphasis in original), and another \\nthat contemplated a future re-conveyance of those lands from the City to ClubLink on stated \\nterms.28 The Court of Appeal found that those conveyance provisions “create contingent interests \\nin the golf course lands” and, since neither of those contingent interests had vested within the \\nperpetuity period, they were now void.29 In my view, there are no analogous conveyance \\nprovisions in Y5. The City’s rights are purely contractual and, furthermore, that contractual right \\nis not contingent. Rather, the grant was acquired the date that the subdivision agreement was \\nexecuted.30  \\nDoes Y5 amount to a constructive taking? \\n[53] \\nCedarhill contends that to enforce the terms of Y5 would constitute a de facto expropriation \\nto which it is entitled to compensation in accordance with the Expropriations Act.31 Cedarhill \\nargues that the test for a constructive taking focusses on “effects” and “advantages”, and as such \\n                                                 \\n \\n27 Langille v.

E.26. \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\nsubstance and not form is to prevail. Where an owner is left with only notional use of the land, \\ndeprived of all economic value, the test will be satisfied.     \\n[54] \\nThe Supreme Court has confirmed that a “‘taking’ is a ‘forcible acquisition by the Crown \\nof privately owned property … for public purposes’”.32 Further, the Expropriations Act defines \\n“expropriate” as “the taking of land without the consent of the owner by an expropriating authority \\nin the exercise of its statutory powers” [emphasis added].   \\n[55] \\nIn my view, there is no basis for Cedarhill’s assertion that the exercise of the City’s licence, \\nif that was to occur, would amount to a constructive taking, for the following reasons. First, Cedpar \\nvoluntarily executed the subdivision agreement, including Y5. Second, Cedpar’s concurrence with \\nand consent to the agreement is fundamentally inconsistent with any allegation of expropriation of \\nthe golf course lands by the City. Third, the Expropriations Act defines “expropriate” as “the taking \\nof land without the consent of the owner by an expropriating authority in the exercise of its \\nstatutory powers” [emphasis added].33 Cedpar’s consent to the subdivision agreement in 1980 is, \\nin my view, a complete answer to any allegation of “effective confiscation” of the golf course \\nlands, as would be required to establish a constructive taking for which compensation should be \\nconsidered.34  \\n \\nConclusion      \\n                                                 \\n \\n32 Annapolis Group Inc. v.

The uncontested evidence \\nof Cedarhill is that the golf course is financially unviable, which I accept. Thus, to force Cedarhill \\nto continue operating the golf course in perpetuity would lead to an impractical result.  \\n[57] \\nWhile Y5 grants the City a “step-in” remedy, no one has argued – and for good reason, it \\nwould seem – that the City has any intention of taking over operation of the golf course. \\nAccordingly, it appears unlikely that cl. 3 of Y5 will be engaged to determine whether the City \\ncan make the golf course a commercially viable operation. \\n[58] \\nThat leaves cl. 8 of Y5, which provides that it may be amended or altered by Cedarhill and \\nthe City “as they may agree”. This, in my view, provides the obvious mechanism by which \\nCedarhill could stop operating the golf course, with the City’s agreement. \\n[59] \\nIn its prayer for relief, Cedarhill claimed such further and other relief as this Honourable \\nCourt deems just in the circumstances.  \\n[60] \\nRule 38.10 of the Rules of Civil Procedure35 provides the following, inter alia: \\n(1) On the hearing of an application the presiding judge may, \\n(a) grant the relief sought or dismiss or adjourn the \\napplication, in whole or in part and with or without terms. \\n[61] \\nIn the result, I would adjourn the application for a period of 120 days and direct that the \\nparties engage in mediation, with a view to achieving resolution in keeping with cl. 8 of Y5.   \\n                                                 \\n \\n35 R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. \\n2024 ONSC 1946 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\n[62] \\nFailing resolution, the matter shall be returned to the court to consider what, if any, \\ndirection may be provided in accordance with cl. 8 of Y5.   \\n \\n[63] \\nFinally, in the circumstances, I would adjourn the assessment and award of any costs of \\nthe application for the time being.     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   _______________________________________ \\nThe Honourable Mr. Justice B.

Elliot and Ward, 2024 ONSC 1907 \\n \\n \\n COURT FILE NO.: 365/21 \\nDATE: 2024-04-02 \\nSUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE - ONTARIO \\nRE: \\nKatherine Churchill, Applicant \\nChristopher David Elliot, Respondent \\nSandra Ward, Respondent, Noted in Default \\nBEFORE: \\nThe Honourable Mr. Justice A. Pazaratz \\nCOUNSEL: Brent Balmer, Counsel for the Applicant  \\nJonathan Krashinsky, Counsel for the Respondent Elliot \\nHEARD: \\nMarch 27, 2024 \\nENDORSEMENT \\n \\n1 \\n“Without prejudice”.  In parenting orders you can only say it so many times – \\nand for so many months (years?) – before it starts to lose its impact. \\n2 \\nA quick count confirms the parties filed more than 500 pages of motion \\nmaterials on the issue of whether we should dramatically change long-\\nstanding interim parenting arrangements for a young boy -- where the same \\nissue is now scheduled for a 10-day-trial three months from now. \\n3 \\nAs may be evident from the page count, there are a lot of disputed allegations \\nand professional recommendations here – and none of them have been tested. \\n4 \\nThe people involved: \\n \\na. The Applicant mother is 33.  The Respondent father is 45.  They are the \\nparents of eight-year-old Nathan who is the subject of this motion.   \\nb. The mother has an 11-year-old son of a former relationship, living with \\nher. \\nc. The father has two older children ages 18 and 17.  The 17-year-old \\ndaughter has some special needs and is living with him. \\nd. The added Respondent Sandra Ward is the mother of the 17-year-old.   \\nShe was noted in default on February 10, 2023, and did not participate in \\nthis motion. \\n \\n5 \\nNathan is currently living with the father, and sees the mother three out of \\nfour weekends.  The mother seeks to immediately change that placement – \\nand Nathan’s school – so that the child would live with her and see the father \\nalternate weekends. \\n6 \\nI will briefly summarize the chronology: \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n2 \\n \\n \\n7 \\nThe unmarried parties lived together between 2015 and June 2020.  The \\nmother says she was the primary caregiver for Nathan.  The father disputes \\nthis. \\n8 \\nBetween June 2020 and March 2022 the child resided primarily with the \\nmother, and the father had parenting time. \\n9 \\nFrom approximately October 2021 to March 2022 the mother and her older \\nson were each experiencing mental health issues.  The older son became \\naggressive within the household and also engaged in destructive and self-\\nharming behaviours, all of this while Nathan was residing in the household.  \\nPolice and CAS were repeatedly involved.  It became evident that Nathan \\nneeded to be removed from the upheaval and instability of that household.   \\n10 \\nOn March 8, 2022 the mother asked the father to care for Nathan because she \\nwas preoccupied dealing with her older son who had been hospitalized.  The \\nfather took Nathan in. \\n11 \\nThe mother says two days later she advised the father that her home situation \\nhad stabilized, and she asked that Nathan be returned to her care.  The father \\nrefused, expressing concern that the long-standing mental health issues \\nrelating to the mother and her older son were serious and unresolved.  He said \\nNathan should not be returned to that physically and psychologically \\ndangerous environment. \\n12 \\nThe mother accused the father of unfairly exploiting what she characterized as \\na brief period of crisis in her household.  She immediately commenced this \\napplication seeking Nathan’s return to her care.  The issues have been \\nvigorously litigated since then. \\n13 \\nOn June 15, 2022 Justice Bingham made an interim, without prejudice \\nconsent order at a case conference which included: \\n  \\na. Nathan’s primary residence with the father \\nb. Mother to have parenting time on a gradually increasing schedule, leading \\nto alternate weekends from Friday at 5:00 p.m. to Sunday at 5:00 p.m. \\nc. Exchanges through third parties.  Parents to have no direct contact with \\none another. \\nd. Mother’s older son not to be present during any of mother’s time with \\nNathan. \\n \\n14 \\nOn July 22, 2022 the father was ordered to pay $1,000.00 per month interim \\nspousal support, and the OCL was asked to become involved. \\n15 \\nOn March 8, 2023 there was a further interim, without prejudice consent order \\nwhich included: \\n \\na. Mother’s time with Nathan was expanded to include PD days and holiday \\nMondays. \\nb. The mother’s older son could be present for two hours at the end of \\nNathan\\'s parenting time, provided that another person was present. \\nc. Additional provisions regarding locations and exchanges. \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n3 \\n \\n \\n16 \\nOn June 23, 2023 the parties consented to another interim, without prejudice \\norder which included: \\n \\na. Primary residence with the father was continued. \\nb. There was further incremental expansion of the mother’s time, and her \\nolder son was permitted to be present for up to three hours of Nathan’s \\nparenting time.  Mother to advise father if there were any incidents \\ninvolving her older son while Nathan was present, and to advise what \\nsteps she had taken to protect Nathan. \\nc. Parties to communicate through AppClose. \\nd. Provision for further modification of parenting time as agreed. \\ne. No child support payable by either party. \\nf. Father to continue to pay $1,000.00 per month spousal support. \\n \\n17 \\nOn August 28, 2023 the OCL issued its s.112 report prepared by clinician \\nSarah Martyn.  The 33-page narrative (49 pages including appendices) \\nprovides a very detailed analysis relating not only to the parents and Nathan, \\nbut also relating to the father’s daughter and the mother’s older son.  \\n18 \\nThe OCL’s recommendations relating to Nathan include:  \\n \\na. Mother to have decision-making responsibility for Nathan. She should \\nconsult with the father through AppClose prior to making any major \\ndecisions. She is to consider the father’s input and then advise him of the \\ndecisions made.  \\nb. Nathan will be enrolled at the Brainery school on Monday and Tuesday of \\neach week, and continue enrolment at his current Sandhills Public School \\non Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of each week.  Parents to participate \\nin facilitating and supporting this hybrid arrangement. \\nc. Provisions re continuity of medical and dental care. \\nd. Mother to be responsible for day-to-day health care for Nathan. Each \\nparent to be responsible for emergency medical care when Nathan is in \\ntheir care. \\ne. Additional provisions for security in relation to the mother’s older son’s \\nmental health issues. \\nf. Nathan to have a shared parenting schedule between his two homes, \\nincluding Sunday and Monday nights with the mother; Tuesday, \\nWednesday and Thursday nights with the father; weekends alternating \\nbetween the parents; and additional holiday provisions. \\ng. If the mother’s older son experiences “periods of dysregulation”, the \\nmother should openly speak to the father about this and make an \\nalternative care plan for Nathan if required. \\nh. Provision for sibling contact. \\n \\n19 \\nOn September 27, 2023 the father filed a Dispute to the OCL Report.   \\n20 \\nOn October 23, 2023 the OCL filed a Dispute Response. \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n4 \\n \\n \\n21 \\nAlso on October 23, 2023, at a settlement conference the parties consented to \\nyet another interim, without prejudice order which included: \\n \\na. Nathan would have parenting time with the mother three weekends out of \\nfour.  Specification of Christmas time-sharing. \\nb. Exchange provisions. \\nc. Mother’s older son could now be present during Nathan\\'s parenting time, \\nwithout restriction. \\n \\n22 \\nOn January 18, 2024 Justice Madsen conducted a Trial Management \\nConference. \\n \\na. A 10-day trial was scheduled for the sittings of June 10, 2024. \\nb. A detailed Trial Scheduling Endorsement Form was completed, setting out \\nthat both parents and the OCL clinical investigator would be testifying.  In \\naddition the mother would be calling 14 supporting witnesses and the \\nfather would be calling 29 supporting witnesses. \\nc. The mother was authorized to proceed with this long motion, and \\ntimelines for materials were set. \\n \\n23 \\nOn March 27, 2024 the motion was heard, requiring one-half day. \\n24 \\nThe mother’s requests included the following: \\n \\na. Transfer Nathan’s primary care to the mother immediately. \\nb. Transfer Nathan’s school to Beechwood Brainery in Cambridge (where \\nthe mother works) or in the alternative, Nathan to attend school in the \\nmother’s catchment area. \\nc. Father to have Nathan on alternate weekends Friday at 6:00 p.m. until \\nSunday at 6:00 p.m.  Other times as arranged between the parties. \\nd. Mother to be entitled to enroll Nathan in counselling without the father’s \\nconsent. \\ne. Father to pay child support. \\nf. Costs. \\n \\n25 \\nThe father asks that the mother’s motion be dismissed in its entirety, without \\ncosts. \\n26 \\nThe mother’s narrative on this motion includes: \\n \\na. She recognizes that the court may be reluctant to make interim changes \\nwith a trial being about three months away.  She also recognizes that the \\ncourt may be reluctant to change Nathan’s school this late in the school \\nyear. \\nb. But the OCL report was quite thorough and specifically recommended that \\nNathan would prefer to reside primarily with the mother, and he would \\nprefer to attend school at the Brainery. \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n5 \\n \\n \\nc. While the mother admits she asked the father to care for Nathan briefly in \\nMarch 2022, it was only while she dealt with some immediate mental \\nhealth crises involving herself and her older son.  Her home situation \\nsettled down very quickly thereafter, and the father’s refusal to return \\nNathan to the mother constitutes “self-help” which should not be \\nrewarded.  The court should not respect or perpetuate a status quo which \\nwas created unilaterally and strategically.   \\nd. In any event, while the father may be able to argue that Nathan has been \\nwith him for these past two years, prior to March 2022 Nathan was with \\nthe mother for an equivalent two years.  And if you factor in that the \\nmother was the primary caregiver while the parties were living together, \\nthe mother actually has a much more comprehensive history of caring for \\nNathan. \\ne. Three weekends out of four isn’t nearly enough time given the strong bond \\nNathan has with the mother and her older son.  Nathan has clearly \\nexpressed a desire to spend the majority of time with the mother. \\nf. While the father’s parenting skills are adequate or largely equivalent to the \\nmother’s, there is one big difference which needs to be addressed right \\naway.  The father refuses to recognize the importance of the mother in \\nNathan’s life, and he refuses to promote or facilitate the mother’s role or \\nrelationship with the child.  The mother says this is evident in the father’s \\nrelentless efforts to restrict her contact with Nathan, without justification.  \\nShe feels Nathan is being harmed continuing to reside with one parent \\nwho conveys unwarranted negativity toward the other parent.  In contrast, \\nshe has always respected and promoted the father-child relationship and \\nwill continue to do so. \\ng. The mental health issues relating to the mother and her older son have \\nbeen resolved.  This is evident from the father’s willingness to consent to \\nthe previous interim orders which have gradually expanded the mother’s \\ntime and removed restrictions with respect to her older son.  If those \\nmental health concerns no longer exist, it is unfair for the father to keep \\nusing them as an excuse to interfere with the mother’s relationship with \\nNathan. \\n \\n27 \\nThe father’s narrative on this motion includes: \\n \\na. The father disputes much of the mother’s evidence.  He disputes the \\nOCL’s factual findings and recommendations.  He feels his own evidence \\nis supported by the records of CAS workers, many of whom are now \\nscheduled to testify at trial.   \\nb. He emphasizes that none of the evidence has been tested.  Questioning has \\nnot taken place.  He seeks the opportunity of a trial, so that he and his \\nwitnesses can present their evidence, and where all witnesses will be \\nsubject to cross-examination. \\nc. He says even the mother’s evidence confirms many aspects of his case.   \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n6 \\n \\n \\nd. The mother admits the father’s care of Nathan is appropriate, and that the \\nchild is doing well.   \\ne. The mother admits that when Nathan was in her care, she and her older \\nson had terrible mental health and behavioural challenges which \\njeopardized the young child’s well-being.  Those mental health challenges \\nhave been profound and enduring.  It is superficial and self-serving for the \\nmother to simply declare that things are better now, and expect everyone \\nto take her word for it.  The father says those long-standing problems are \\nmore severe than the mother is admitting.  He urges the court to be \\ncautious.  He warns against experimenting with Nathan by thrusting him \\ninto a new situation before each party’s parenting proposal has been \\nthoroughly analyzed and tested. \\nf. The father absolutely denies the suggestion that he is not supportive of the \\nmother’s relationship with Nathan.  This appears to be her strongest \\nargument in favour of an immediate change of everything in Nathan’s life.  \\nBut the father’s materials include CAS notes which confirm the magnitude \\nof the jeopardy Nathan was facing before being removed from the \\nmother’s household in March 2022.  The father did not orchestrate the \\ntransfer of Nathan to his care.  He stepped up when asked.  And he has not \\nexploited or prolonged the current situation.  He has simply been trying to \\nprotect his son from serious risk of harm.  It is not fair to characterize his \\nresponse to the mother’s crises as “self-help”. \\ng. The mother has not established that there has been any material change in \\ncircumstances since any of the previous interim orders she consented to. \\nh. In any event, the reality is that Nathan has been in a stable, loving \\nenvironment with the father for the past two years.  He is doing well in his \\ncurrent school where he has many connections and supports.  He is doing \\nbetter than he was when he was in the mother’s care.   There is no \\ncompelling evidence – even if believed – to suggest that Nathan would be \\nbetter off suddenly having everything change in his life. \\ni. The mother offers no actual plan.  She seems to acknowledge changing \\nschools at this stage is a bad idea.  At the hearing of the motion the mother \\nsuggested a compromise proposal of Nathan attending her preferred \\nschool a couple of days a week and then continuing at his current school \\nthe remainder of the week.  This “hybrid” proposal suggested by the OCL \\nis extremely unusual, and the father seeks an opportunity to adduce and \\nchallenge evidence on the topic.  More to the point, the mother has \\nprovided no specific details as to how either her original or compromise \\nproposal would work.  She doesn’t have a car.  During submissions, her \\nlawyer suggested she might be able to arrange some transportation for the \\nchild on certain school days, but the court has received no evidence about \\nthis. \\nj. Nathan’s sibling relationships are important, and must be carefully \\nconsidered before any changes are imposed.  The father still has serious \\nconcerns about Nathan having additional contact with the mother’s older \\nson who continues to reside with her.  As well, Nathan has a close \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n7 \\n \\n \\nrelationship with the father’s 17-year-old daughter.  All of these dynamics \\ncan be considered at trial.  We are not doing Nathan any favour if we start \\nexperimenting with his life, without knowing all of the facts. \\nk. While the mother proposes counselling for Nathan on the basis that “it \\ncouldn’t hurt”, the father’s input from the child’s school reinforces his \\nown perception that Nathan is doing well and doesn’t need counselling.  \\nThis is another topic where the father proposes that any decisions be made \\nafter careful analysis, and not through hasty guesswork. \\n \\n28 \\nCounsel agree on the applicable statutory analysis, and the best interests test \\nwhich the court must apply.  They narrowly disagree on the evidentiary \\nburden on the mother, and more generally, on the weight to be applied to \\ncertain factors when a party seeks an interim change to an interim order with a \\ntrial imminent. \\n29 \\nSections 24 and 33.1(1) of the Children’s Law Reform Act govern this \\nsituation. \\n \\n24(1) Best interests of the child \\nIn making a parenting order or contact order with respect to a child, the \\ncourt shall only take into account the best interests of the child in \\naccordance with this section. \\n \\n24(2) Primary consideration \\nIn determining the best interests of a child, the court shall consider all \\nfactors related to the circumstances of the child, and, in doing so, shall \\ngive primary consideration to the child\\'s \\nphysical, emotional and psychological safety, security and well-being. \\n \\n24(3) Factors \\nFactors related to the circumstances of a child include, \\n \\n(a) the child\\'s needs, given the child\\'s age and stage of development, such \\nas the child\\'s need for stability; \\n(b) the nature and strength of the child\\'s relationship with each parent, \\neach of the child\\'s siblings and grandparents and any other person who \\nplays an important role in the child\\'s \\nlife; \\n(c) each parent\\'s willingness to support the development and maintenance \\nof the child\\'s relationship with the other parent; \\n(d) the history of care of the child; \\n(e) the child\\'s views and preferences, giving due weight to the child\\'s age \\nand maturity, unless they cannot be ascertained; \\n(f) the child\\'s cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and \\nheritage, including Indigenous upbringing and heritage; \\n(g) any plans for the child\\'s care; \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n8 \\n \\n \\n(h) the ability and willingness of each person in respect of whom the \\norder would apply to care for and meet the needs of the child; \\n(i) the ability and willingness of each person in respect of whom the \\norder would apply to communicate and co-operate, in particular with one \\nanother, on matters affecting the \\nchild; \\n(j) any family violence and its impact on, among other things, \\n(i) the ability and willingness of any person who engaged in the family \\nviolence to care for and meet the needs of the child, and \\n(ii) the appropriateness of making an order that would require persons in \\nrespect of whom the order would apply to cooperate on issues affecting \\nthe child; and \\n(k) any civil or criminal proceeding, order, condition or measure that is \\nrelevant to the safety, security and well-being of the child. \\n \\n24(4) Factors relating to family violence \\nIn considering the impact of any family violence under clause (3)(j), the \\ncourt shall take into account, \\n \\n(a) the nature, seriousness and frequency of the family violence and when \\nit occurred; \\n(b) whether there is a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour in \\nrelation to a family member; \\n(c) whether the family violence is directed toward the child or whether \\nthe child is directly or indirectly exposed to the family violence; \\n(d) the physical, emotional and psychological harm or risk of harm to the \\nchild; \\n(e) any compromise to the safety of the child or other family member; \\n(f) whether the family violence causes the child or other family member \\nto fear for their own safety or for that of another person; \\n(g) any steps taken by the person engaging in the family violence to \\nprevent further family violence from occurring and improve the person\\'s \\nability to care for and meet the needs \\nof the child; and \\n(h) any other relevant factor. \\n \\n24(5) Past conduct \\nIn determining what is in the best interests of the child, the court shall not \\ntake into consideration the past conduct of any person, unless the conduct \\nis relevant to the exercise of the \\nperson\\'s decision-making responsibility, parenting time or contact with \\nrespect to the child. \\n \\n24(6) Allocation of parenting time \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n9 \\n \\n \\nIn allocating parenting time, the court shall give effect to the principle \\nthat a child should have as much time with each parent as is consistent \\nwith the best interests of the child. \\n \\n24(7) Application to related orders \\nThis section applies with respect to interim parenting orders and contact \\norders, and to variations of parenting orders and contact orders or interim \\nparenting orders and contact orders. \\n \\n \\n33.1(1) Best interests of the child \\nA person to whom decision-making responsibility, parenting time or \\ncontact has been granted with respect to a child under a parenting order \\nor contact order shall exercise the decision \\nmaking responsibility, parenting time or contact in a manner that is \\nconsistent with the best interests of the child within the meaning \\nof section 24. \\n \\n30 \\nSection 24(1) of the CLRA provides that the court shall take into consideration \\nonly the best interests of a child when making a parenting order or a contact \\norder.    \\n \\na. The ‘best interests’ test is a flexible and fact-driven exercise, tailored to \\nthe needs and circumstances of the child’s whose well-being is under \\nconsideration.  De Souza v. De Souza, 2023 ONSC 2457 (SCJ).   \\nb. Case by case consideration of the unique circumstances of each child is \\nthe hallmark of the process. Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60 \\n(SCC); O’Connor v. Duguay, 2023 ONSC 2374 (SCJ) \\nc. The analysis must remain centered on the rights of the child, from a child-\\ncentred perspective. The ‘rights’ of a parent are not a criterion. Young v. \\nYoung, 1993 CanLII 34 (SCC)  \\nd. The focus is on the child, not the parent. S.S.L. v. M.A.B., 2022 ONSC \\n6326 (SCJ). \\n \\n31 \\nSection 24(2) says when considering best interest factors, primary \\nconsideration is to be given to the child’s physical, emotional and \\npsychological safety, security and well-being.  Pierre v. Pierre, 2021 ONSC \\n5650 (SCJ). \\n32 \\nSection 24(3) sets out a list of factors for the court to address when \\nconsidering the circumstances of a child and determining best interests. \\n33 \\nThe court is required to undertake a broad analysis of each child’s specific \\nsituation.   \\n \\na. The list of best interests factors in the Act is not exhaustive. White v. \\nKozun, 2021 ONSC 41 (SCJ); Pereira v. Ramos, 2021 ONSC 1736 (SCJ); \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n10 \\n \\n \\nSeyyad v. Pathan, 2022 ONCJ 501 (OCJ); J.T. v. E.J., 2022 ONSC 4596 \\n(SCJ). \\nb. None of the listed factors are given priority, except the primary \\nconsideration in 24(2) is overarching. O’Connor v. Duguay, 2023 ONSC \\n2374 (SCJ). \\nc. No single criterion is determinative. The weight to be given to each factor \\ndepends on the circumstances of the particular child. Dayboll v. Binag, \\n2022 ONSC 6510 (SCJ) \\nd. The listed factors are not a checklist to be tabulated with the highest score \\nwinning. Rather, the court must take a holistic look at the child, his or her \\nneeds and the people in the child’s life. Phillips v. Phillips, 2021 ONSC \\n2480.  W.H.C. v. W.C.M.C. 2021 ONCJ 308 (OCJ); Harry v. Moore 2021 \\nONCJ 341 (OCJ); McIntosh v Baker, 2022 ONSC 4235 (SCJ); Brownson \\nv. Brownson, 2022 ONSC 5882 (SCJ). \\ne. An assessment of the best interests of the child must take into account all \\nof the relevant circumstances with respect to the needs of the child and the \\nability of each parent to meet those needs. Mokhov v. Ratayeva, 2021 \\nONSC 5454 (SCJ). \\nf. The child’s best interests are not merely “paramount” – they are the only \\nconsideration in this analysis.  Gordon v. Goertz, 1996 CanLII 191 (SCC), \\n[1996] 2 S.C.R. 27 at para. 28; Mattina v. Mattina, 2018 ONCA 641 (ON \\nCA); E.M. v. C.V. 2022 ONSC 7037 (SCJ). \\ng. The court must ascertain a child’s best interests from the perspective of the \\nchild rather than that of the parents. Gordon v. Goertz, [1996] 2 S.C.R. \\n27.(SCC). Adult preferences or “rights” do not form part of the analysis \\nexcept insofar as they are relevant to the determination of the best interests \\nof the child.  Young v. Young 1993 CanLII 34 (SCC); E.M.B. v. \\nM.F.B.  2021 ONSC 4264 (SCJ). \\nh. The court’s unrelenting focus on the best interests of each particular child \\nmeans that there can be no presumption in favour of any one type of \\nparenting order.   All things being equal, each child deserves to have a \\nmeaningful and consistent relationship with both parents.  E.M.B. v. \\nM.F.B. 2021 ONSC 4264 (SCJ). \\n \\n34 \\nSection 29 of the CLRA sets out the Court’s authority to change a parenting \\norder. \\n \\n29(1) Variation of orders \\nA court shall not make an order under this Part that varies a parenting \\norder or contact order unless there has been a material change in \\ncircumstances that affects or is likely to affect the best interests of the \\nchild who is the subject of the order. \\n \\n35 \\nTypically, on an interim motion the court is presented with conflicting \\naffidavits which are incomplete and untested.  The facts are often still \\nevolving.  As a result, a temporary order is meant to provide a reasonably \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n11 \\n \\n \\nacceptable solution on an expeditious basis for a problem that will be fully \\ncanvassed at subsequent conferences or resolved at a trial.  Coe v. Tope, 2014 \\nONSC 4002 (SCJ); Munroe v. Graham, 2021 ONCJ 253 (SCJ); Nicholson v. \\nNicholson, 2021 ONSC 7045 (SCJ); Shokoufimogiman v. Bozorgi, 2022 \\nONSC 5057 (SCJ); Sadiq v Musa, 2023 ONSC 1811 (SCJ); Grover v Grover, \\n2023 ONSC 3607 (SCJ). \\n36 \\nAlthough the “status quo” is frequently mentioned as an important \\nconsideration in determining or continuing parenting arrangements – \\nparticularly at the interim stage -- the term “status quo” is not specifically \\nmentioned in the legislation. However, section 24(3)(d) of the CLRA lists “the \\nhistory of care of the child” as a factor in determining best interests. That \\nfactor appears to be another way of describing “status quo”.  Brownson v. \\nBrownson, 2022 ONSC 5882 (SCJ). \\n \\na. It is a long-standing legal principle that absent evidence of a material \\nchange and that an immediate change is required, the status quo is \\nordinarily to be maintained until trial:  Niel v. Niel, 1976 CanLII 1925 \\n(ON CA), 28 R.F.L. 257 (Ont. C.A.), Grant v. Turgeon, 2000 CanLII \\n22565 (ON SC), 5 R.F.L. (5th) 326 (Ont. S.C.J.); Wang v. Tang, 2023 \\nONSC 3609 (SCJ); Easton v. McAvoy, 2005 CarswellOnt 7379 (OCJ); \\nLevesque v. Bond, 2023 ONSC 1895 (SCJ) \\nb. The status quo – and avoiding reckless creation of a new status quo - are \\nimportant considerations at the interim stage.  Cosentino v. \\nCosentino, 2016 ONSC 5621 (SCJ); Cabral v. Parker 2021 ONSC 4574 \\n(SCJ); Viveash v. Viveash 2021 ONSC 7456 (SCJ); N.D. v. R.K ., 2020 \\nONCJ 266 (OCJ).   The longer the status quo has existed, the greater the \\npresumption that it should be maintained pending trial, unless there is \\nmaterial evidence that the child’s best interests require an immediate \\nchange.    W.H.C. v. W.C.M.C. 2021 ONCJ 308 (OCJ); Ceho v. \\nCeho, 2015 ONSC 5285 (SCJ); Batsinda v. Batsinda 2013 ONSC 7869 \\n(SCJ); Green v. Cairns, 2004 CanLII 9301 (SCJ); Papp v. Papp, 1969 \\nCanLII 219 (ON CA); MacDonald v. Cannell, 2021 ONSC 7769 (SCJ). \\nc. Temporary orders are “band-aid” solutions pending a full hearing.  The \\nstatus quo is ordinarily maintained pending trial unless the evidence \\ndemonstrates that the best interests of the child require some modification.  \\nSullivan v. Senechal, 2022 ONSC 557 (SCJ) \\nd. To disturb the status quo, there must be compelling evidence to show the \\nwelfare of the child would be in danger if the status quo is maintained.  \\nThe evidence must clearly and unequivocally establish that the status \\nquo is not in the child’s best interests. Miranda v. Miranda, 2013 ONSC \\n4704 (SCJ); Dayboll v. Binag, 2022 ONSC 6510 (SCJ); A.L. v. C.M., 2023 \\nONCJ 412 (OCJ); Tomkinson v. Baszak 2023 ONSC 4092 (SCJ). \\ne. The status quo is particularly important on an interim motion because the \\ncourt is often not in a position to make factual findings based on \\nincomplete and untested evidence. R.C. v. L.C., 2021 ONSC 1963 (SCJ); \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n12 \\n \\n \\nC.C. v. I.C., 2021 ONSC 6471 (SCJ); Dayboll v. Binag, 2022 ONSC 6510 \\n(SCJ); Chaput v. Chaput, 2021 ONSC 2809 (SCJ);  \\n \\n37 \\nThe court must be mindful that an interim order can often have long-\\nterm implications for the child and the outcome of the litigation. F.B. \\nv. C.H. 2021 ONCJ 275 (OCJ); Coe v. Tope, 2014 ONSC 4002 (SCJ).  \\nAs a result, the existence of a status quo – and its manner of creation – \\nare often the subject of significant controversy at the motion stage. \\n \\na. The status quo may be established by reference to the parents\\' \\npractice or the child\\'s routine prior to separation; by any \\nconsensual arrangement made after separation; or by court order. \\nBrady v. Fitzpatrick 2022 ONSC 2380 (SCJ); Gray v. \\nCanonico, 2020 ONSC 5885 (SCJ); Falarz v. Gullusci 2023 \\nONSC 2644 (SCJ) \\nb. If a motion is brought immediately after separation, the court will need to \\ndetermine parenting roles and the child’s routine while the parties were \\ntogether, with emphasis on more recent patterns.  If a time-sharing \\narrangement has emerged on a consensual basis since the date of \\nseparation – and if it is meeting the child’s needs – the court will be \\nreluctant to change an arrangement which the child has become used to.  \\nBut if only a short amount of time has elapsed between the creation of a \\nnew status quo and the hearing of the motion, the court will be more \\ninclined to presume that restoration of a previous successful status quo is \\nappropriate. Kennedy v. Hull 2005 ONCJ 275 (OCJ); M.H.S. v. M.R. 2021 \\nONCJ 665 (OCJ).  \\n \\n38 \\nBecause of the obvious importance of the status quo as a best interests \\nconsideration, courts must be mindful of - and actively discourage - efforts by \\nparents to unilaterally create a new status quo through manipulation, \\nexaggeration or deception. Izyuk v. Bilousov, 2011 ONSC 6451 (SCJ); Coe v. \\nTope, 2014 ONSC 4002 (SCJ).    \\n \\na. The status quo does not refer to a situation unreasonably created by one \\nparty after separation to obtain a tactical advantage in the litigation.  \\nCabral v. Parker 2021 ONSC 4574 (SCJ); Theriault v. Ford, 2022 ONSC \\n3619 (SCJ)  Neither parent has the right to suddenly impose major \\nchanges in a child’s life, or to unilaterally interfere with or impede the \\nother parent’s contact or role in the child’s life. A parent cannot be \\npermitted to gain a litigation advantage through manipulation of events, or \\nby creating a new arrangement which they may later characterize as the \\n“status quo.” Rifai v. Green 2014 ONSC 1377 (SCJ); Ivory v. Ivory 2021 \\nONSC 5475 (SCJ); J.F.R. v. K.L.L. 2022 ONSC 5067 (SCJ); Wang v. \\nTang, 2023 ONSC 3609 (SCJ). \\nb. Parents cannot resort to self-help remedies; ignore obligations under \\nagreements or orders; present a fait accompli to the court on an interim \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n13 \\n \\n \\nbasis; and expect the court to approve. That is a recipe for chaos, and \\ndisaster, and is unfair to children caught in the middle. Sain v \\nShahbazi, 2023 ONSC 5187 (SCJ) \\nc. Self-help is to be discouraged, and certainly not rewarded.  A parent who \\nengages in self-help tactics for strategic purposes -- despite the best \\ninterests of the child -- will generally raise serious questions about their \\nown parenting skills and judgment.  Southorn v. Ree, 2019 ONSC 1298 \\n(SCJ); McPhail v. McPhail, 2018 ONSC 735 (SCJ); C.C. v. I.C., 2021 \\nONSC 6471 (SCJ); Rifai v. Green, 2014 ONSC 1377 (SCJ); M.H.S. v. \\nM.R. 2021 ONCJ 665 (OCJ). \\nd. Neither parent has the right to create a unilateral parenting status quo, \\neven if there is an alleged safety issue. Gray v. Canonico, 2020 ONSC \\n5885 (SCJ); Ivory v. Ivory 2021 ONSC 5475 (SCJ); Ibitoye v. Ibitoye 2023 \\nONSC 2008 (SCJ) \\ne. It is inappropriate for a parent to make secret plans which will have \\nsignificant impact on children and parenting arrangements, and then \\nannounce those plans after decisions have been implemented.  Canning v. \\nDavis-Hall, 2019 ONCJ 971 (OCJ); Doan v. Tran, 2022 ONCJ 419 (OCJ) \\nf. Parents take unilateral action at their own peril.  The court will not \\nsanction self-help in circumstances where the best interests of children \\nmay potentially be jeopardized.  Corrective action by the court may be \\nswift and firm – with long-term consequences quite the opposite of what \\nthe offending parent hoped to achieve.  Fallis v. Decker, 2013 ONSC \\n5206 (SCJ). \\n \\n39 \\nIn this case, the mother accuses the father of having engaged in self-help to \\ncreate – or at least unreasonably perpetuate -- a favourable status quo.  This \\nis one of many allegations which can be explored at trial.  But for purposes of \\nthis interim motion, there is insufficient evidence to satisfy me that the father \\nhas engaged in unilateral or “self-help” behaviour. \\n40 \\nCounsel for the parents disagreed on the extent to which the mother must \\nestablish a material change in circumstances as a threshold consideration on \\nthis motion.  Both counsel referred to Ceho v. Ceho, 2015 ONSC 5285 (SCJ).  \\nThe father also referred to Leggo v. Hulme, 2019 ONSC 2306 (SCJ). \\n41 \\nAs a general rule, no material change in circumstances is required on a motion \\nto change a temporary without prejudice order, or in relation to a time-limited \\ntemporary order. Kirichenko v. Kirichenko  2021 ONSC 2833 (SCJ ). \\n42 \\nWhile the father’s counsel relies on Cehio to suggest that in this case the \\nmother must establish a material change in circumstances, I agree with Justice \\nPrice’s analysis in that case which included the following: \\n \\n[85]      To require a party to establish that a “material change of \\ncircumstances” has occurred since a “temporary temporary and without \\nprejudice order” was made would not promote the primary objective of \\nresolving disputes fairly in the most timely and least expensive \\nmanner.  Rather, it would discourage the temporary settlement of disputes \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n14 \\n \\n \\npending counselling, or questioning, or a clinical investigation by the \\nOCL.  Parties would be more likely to argue the issues prematurely in order \\nto avoid a presumption arising from the status quo in the future.  They \\nwould be less willing to adjourn a motion in the interest of counselling, or \\nquestioning, or OCL investigation, if they thought that the court, upon the \\nreturn of the motion, would require proof of a material change of \\ncircumstances before it would consider the results of those steps.  \\n[86]      The very expression “without prejudice” is intended to preserve the \\nposition of each party.  It would be rendered meaningless if the temporary \\ntemporary order, in fact, prejudiced the party who consented to it, by \\nimposing on that party a higher threshold of proof in the future, and \\nrequiring him or her to prove a material change of circumstances. \\n \\n43 \\nIn Courville v. Courville, 2015 ONCJ 535 (OCJ), a case cited by the mother, \\nJustice Starr stated: \\n \\n[15]              The words “without prejudice\" contained in the consent order \\nof March 25, 2015 and in the order this court made on July 10, 2015, are \\nnot empty words.  The court, the administration of justice, and the parents \\nwho come before this court depend on this.  If family law disputes are to \\nbe settled or moved towards final resolution and in a speedy, efficient, and \\ncost effective way, parties must have the ability to agree to \"test drive\" \\nnew arrangements.  To do this, they must have some assurance that the \\ntemporary without prejudice orders they agree to (particularly when those \\norders deal with trying out changes that they are worried may negatively \\naffect their children), can be reviewed following the agreed upon \\ntimeframe.  In this case, the insertion of the words “without prejudice” \\nwas meant, in part, to give each party confidence that when the motion \\nwas finally heard, the court would start from the presumption that unless \\nthere was a compelling reason to do so, the status quo that they agreed to \\nsuspend, would be maintained. \\n \\n44 \\nAt the earliest stages of litigation – particularly on the first return of a motion \\nwhere there has been insufficient time for a response – a “without prejudice” \\norder may have the advantage of stabilizing the situation, without requiring a \\nmaterial change in circumstances before arrangements can be further \\nconsidered. \\n45 \\nHowever, the court must be mindful that a protracted succession of \\ntemporary-temporary or without prejudice orders may perpetuate – and \\nperhaps even invite – even more motions, as parents jockey to obtain an \\nadvantageous status quo.  That’s largely what’s happened in this case.    \\n \\na. The mother keeps pursuing the same motion -- repeatedly – for the \\ntemporary return of Nathan to her care.   \\nb. The “without prejudice” characterization has allowed her to keep coming \\nback, each time making a bit more headway.   \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n15 \\n \\n \\nc. While each preceding consent order is characterized as being “without \\nprejudice”, the cumulative effect and duration of these successive orders \\neventually erodes the practical significance of the “without prejudice” \\ndesignation. \\n \\n46 \\nAllowing parents an unfettered right to keep trying to change parenting \\narrangements without requiring a material change in circumstances is \\ninconsistent with children’s need for stability and predictability.  At a certain \\npoint, the “without prejudice” characterization becomes counter-productive.  \\nRafla v Fawaz, 2022 ONSC 4512 (SCJ). \\n47 \\nIn parenting cases, the words “without prejudice” have an important but often \\ntime-limited significance.  There is a difference between an interim without \\nprejudice order of short duration and an interim without prejudice order which \\nhas persisted for an extended period of time.  From the parent’s perspective \\nthe “without prejudice” designation preserves options and avoids admissions.  \\nBut from the child’s perspective – which is the one that really counts -- the \\nwords “without prejudice” cannot magically obscure the reality of the child’s \\naccumulating experiences, routines and relationships.  \\n48 \\nYou can call the interim arrangement whatever you want.  But after a child’s \\nplacement has continued uneventfully for months – or in this case years – the \\n“material change in circumstances” test becomes indistinguishable from the \\n“why should we disrupt the status quo?” test. \\n49 \\nOn this motion the mother relies, in part, on some of the contents of the \\nOCL’s lengthy s.112 report.  She does not seek to rely on the clinical \\ninvestigator’s recommendations, but she asks the court to accept some of the \\nclinician’s factual findings (such as the child’s views and preferences).  The \\nfather submits the report should have no relevance at this interim stage.  He \\ndisputes the findings and recommendations, and his lawyer will be cross-\\nexamining the author at trial. \\n50 \\nThe law with respect to interim use of professional reports: \\n \\na. The case law overwhelmingly urges courts to be cautious before relying \\nupon an assessment report or OCL report at an interim stage of the \\nproceedings. Batsinda v. Batsinda, 2013 ONSC 7869 (SCJ): Zantinge v. \\nAbdulrahman 2022 ONSC 1159 (SCJ); Denomme v. Denomme, 2022 \\nONSC 5205 (SCJ); B. v. D. 2022 ONSC 1352 (SCJ); Slaght v. Taylor, \\n2016 ONSC 1904 (SCJ). \\nb. In general, interim implementation of OCL reports and assessments should \\nbe discouraged, as such motions require the court to make profound and \\noften disruptive decisions based on incomplete and untested information.  \\nAny interim change to a status quo creates a risk of further changes – or \\ncomplete reversal – at trial, once the evidence has been more fully \\npresented and tested.  Batsinda v. Batsinda 2013 ONSC 7869 (SCJ); \\nSayeau v Buttle, 2022 ONSC 7246 (SCJ). \\nc. An assessment or section 112 report is only one piece of evidence in a \\nproceeding, intended for use at trial.  At the motion stage the report \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n16 \\n \\n \\nuntested.  It should generally not be adopted without a trial where the \\njudge will have the opportunity to  \\n \\ni. Observe cross-examination of the author;  \\nii. Undertake a thorough analysis and evaluation of all aspects of the \\nassessor\\'s report, including the assessor\\'s credentials, methods, \\nobservations, findings, theories, and recommendations;  \\niii. Observe the testimony and cross-examination of the parties and \\ntheir witnesses; \\niv. Consider all the other relevant evidence in the case. \\n \\nZantinge v. Abdulrahman 2022 ONSC 1159 (SCJ); Batsinda v. \\nBatsinda 2013 ONSC 7869 (SCJ); Marcy v. Belmore, 2012 ONSC 4696 \\n(SCJ); B. v. D. 2022 ONSC 1352 (SCJ); Mayer v. Mayer, [2002] O.J. No. \\n5303 (S.C.J.); Kirkham v. Kirkham, 2008 CarswellOnt 3644 (SCJ);  \\n \\nd. It is usually preferable for the status quo to continue until trial. Denomme \\nv. Denomme, 2022 ONSC 5205 (SCJ).  This, of course, may depend on \\nhow long the parties will have to wait for their trial, and whether anything \\ncan be done to expedite the trial in appropriate circumstances. \\ne. Nonetheless, the best interests of the child must be the paramount \\nconsideration at every stage.  And if the arrival of an assessment or OCL \\nreport presents additional – and reliable – information affecting the \\nimmediate best interests of the child, then in some circumstances it may be \\nappropriate and necessary for the court to utilize the report in making (or \\nchanging) an interim order.  Bos v. Bos, 2012 ONSC 3425 (SCJ) \\nf. Historically, many cases have set out a fairly stringent requirement that \\nthere must be “compelling” or “exceptional” circumstances to change \\nthe status quo pending trial.    Benko v. Torok, 2012 ONCJ 401 (OCJ); \\nGrant v. Turgeon, 2000 CanLII 22565 (SCJ); Daniel v. Henlon, 2018 \\nONCJ 122 (OCJ); Genovesi v. Genovesi, [1992] O.J. No. 1261 (Gen. \\nDiv.).  This could include cases in which a parent has been found to be \\nengaging in potentially alienating behaviours which need to be addressed \\nimmediately.  WDC v. JLM, 2012 ONCJ 700 (OCJ). \\ng. More recently, a number of cases have warned against an “inflexible \\nblanket prohibition” with respect to consideration of assessment reports an \\ninterim motion, especially when that is the only independent evidence \\nbefore the court. Taylor v Clarke, 2017 ONSC 1270 (SCJ).   \\nh. The magnitude of the proposed interim change – and the strength of the \\nnew information – will likely be important factors. \\ni. In both Bos v. Bos, 2012 ONSC 3425 (SCJ) and Jonczyk v. Tilsley  2021 \\nONSC 2546 (SCJ) the court set out four factors to consider when a court is \\nasked to change temporary parenting arrangements, based on an \\nassessment report, without a finding of “exceptional circumstances”: \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n17 \\n \\n \\ni. How significant is the change that is being proposed as compared \\nto the interim status quo? \\nii. What other evidence is before the court to support the change? \\niii. Is the court being asked to consider the entire report and \\nrecommendations, or only some parts, including statements made \\nby children, or observations made by the assessor? \\niv. Are the portions of the report sought to be relied on contentious \\nand if so has either party requested the opportunity to cross-\\nexamine the assessor? \\n \\nj. At the motion stage the court should not presume that an assessor\\'s \\nrecommendations would or should inevitably prevail at trial. Batsinda v. \\nBatsinda, 2013 ONSC 7869 (SCJ); Marcy v. Belmore, 2012 ONSC 4696 \\n(SCJ).  As a result, some cases have held that little or no weight should be \\ngiven to the assessor’s conclusions or recommendations at the interim \\nstage.   \\nk. However, the evidence and observations set out in the report may justify \\nimmediate court action, particularly if the evidence suggests an immediate \\nchange is required to protect children from physical or emotional harm, or \\notherwise promote their best interests.  M. v. S. et al. 2022 ONSC 1687 \\n(SCJ).    \\nl. Information such as statements made by a child to the assessor; the \\nassessor\\'s observations of the parents and the child (individually or \\ntogether); or undisputed facts contained in the report – those portions of an \\nassessment may be of considerable value to a motions judge in \\ndetermining whether interim changes to the parenting regime are required \\nto promote the best interests of the children. Jonczyk v. Tilsley 2021 \\nONSC 2546 (SCJ). \\nm. Parties should not perceive the arrival of an assessment report as creating \\nan automatic strategic opportunity to secure a more favourable status quo, \\nheading into trial.  Marcy v. Belmore, 2012 ONSC 4696 (SCJ).  Clearly, \\nthe facts of each case will be critical and will guide the exercise of the \\ncourt’s discretion.  Jonczyk v. Tilsley  2021 ONSC 2546 (SCJ); Lamacchia \\nv. Carullo, 2022 ONSC 687 (SCJ). \\n \\n51 \\nWhile the mother only seeks to make limited use of the section 112 report at \\nthis stage, I do not find that any of the contents suggest that an immediate and \\ndramatic change to Nathan’s situation is in the child’s best interests – \\nparticularly given the fact that the report will soon be tested at trial.  \\n52 \\nMy considerations in deciding the mother’s motion include the following: \\n \\na. The history here is complex, and Nathan is still a young, vulnerable child.  \\nb. There are many disputed facts and allegations. \\nc. It is impossible to make necessary credibility and factual determinations \\nbased on the lengthy, conflictual and untested affidavit materials.   \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n18 \\n \\n \\nd. It is not disputed that this eight-year-old boy has been primarily resident \\nwith the father for the past two years.  He attends school in the father’s \\ncatchment area. \\ne. It is not disputed that the child’s current placement arose as a result of \\nserious problems in the mother’s household when Nathan was living with \\nher. \\nf. The mother has quite candidly acknowledged that in most respects the \\nfather’s care of Nathan has been adequate, and comparable to the care that \\nshe would provide. \\ng. She expresses a narrow rationale for seeking an immediate and dramatic \\nchange in parenting arrangements for the child.   She has voiced specific \\nconcerns about the father refusing to promote her relationship with her \\nson.  But taken at their strongest, her allegations do not constitute a level \\nof parental alienation which, in some extreme cases, has led to a dramatic \\nchange in interim parenting arrangements.  The mother provides no \\ncompelling evidence that immediate intervention is required to either \\nrescue the child from a bad situation, or advance the child to a \\nsignificantly better situation.  \\nh. The mother also relies on her characterization of the child’s views and \\npreferences.  Here too, the father presents a competing narrative.  To the \\nextent that the mother seeks to rely on an untested OCL report which the \\nfather disputes, it is premature for the court to determine what weight if \\nany should be given to that individual piece of evidence.   In any event, \\nviews and preferences are only one of the relevant considerations in \\ndetermining the best interests of the child.   And views and preferences \\nmay end up being given less weight where the more dominant issue relates \\nto adult lifestyle, behaviour and mental health issues relating to a parent \\nand members of their household. \\ni. At every stage, the court must focus on the best interests of the child.  And \\nthe evidence on this case does not displace the presumption that once a \\nstable and beneficial parenting arrangement has been created, it is in the \\nbest interests of the child to maintain continuity and successful routines \\npending trial. \\nj. The magnitude of the issues and the extent of the factual dispute herein is \\nreflected by the length of the pending trial (10 days) and the number of \\nanticipated witnesses (approximately 46).   \\nk. That trial – only three months away – will create an opportunity for a \\nmuch more detailed and comprehensive analysis of all the evidence \\n(including vitally important testing of evidence through cross-\\nexamination).   \\nl. For purposes of this motion, the mother’s emphasis that all previous orders \\nwere “without prejudice” has little impact on the best interests analysis.  \\nEven without imposing the elevated threshold requirement of establishing \\na material change in circumstances, the court still requires compelling \\nreasons to disrupt a successful two-year status quo on the eve of trial.  No \\n2024 ONSC 1907 (CanLII)\\n19 \\n \\n \\nmatter what test is applied, the mother has not established that her \\nrequested changes are necessary for the benefit of the child. \\nm. To the contrary, the mother’s plan is filled with uncertainties which need \\nto be fully canvassed at trial.  And the mother’s request to change \\nNathan’s school this late in the school year only compounds the court’s \\noverall concern about the magnitude of her proposed disruption of the \\nchild.  With the scheduling of the trial roughly coinciding with the end of \\nthe current school year, that would be a more appropriate time to consider \\nany change in school registration. \\nn. The court simply cannot impose a dramatic change on this young child, \\nbased upon incomplete information.  Very soon, all of these important \\nissues will be thoroughly and properly considered.  In the meantime, we \\nmust not make hasty decisions which might be subject to further change or \\neven reversal at trial. \\n \\n53 \\nThe mother’s motion is dismissed. \\n54 \\nIf the parties cannot resolve the issue of costs, they are to serve and file \\nwritten submissions (no longer than two pages including case law links, plus a \\nbill of costs and any offers) on the following timelines. \\n \\na.

STOTHART J. \\n[1] \\nThis is a summary conviction appeal by the Crown from an acquittal and stay of \\nproceedings ordered by Justice A.H. Perron on January 17, 2023.  \\nOverview \\n[2] \\nMichael Lemieux was charged with one count of assaulting a police officer, contrary to s. \\n270(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada. This charge arose out of a brief interaction between \\nthe respondent and a police officer late at night on Clarence Street, in North Bay, Ontario.  \\n[3] \\nAt the commencement of the trial, the respondent brought a Charter application, alleging \\nviolations of his ss.7, 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights. It was agreed that the trial would proceed in a \\n“blended fashion” with the evidence called applying to both the Charter application and the trial \\nitself.  \\n[4] \\nFollowing a trial that spanned several days, the trial judge found the respondent not guilty. \\nHe then went on and found that there had been violations of the respondent’s ss.7, 9 and 10 Charter \\nrights, and found that the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings in accordance with s.24(1) \\nof the Charter.  \\n[5] \\nThe Crown as appellant appeals against the acquittal and the trial judge’s decision with \\nrespect to ss.7, 9 and 24(1) of the Charter. The appellant does not appeal from the finding that the \\nrespondent’s s.10 Charter rights were infringed.  \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nEvidence at trial  \\n[6] \\nAlthough several witnesses testified at trial, I will summarize only the evidence that relates \\nto this appeal.  \\n[7] \\nOn October 7, 2020, at around 11:35 p.m., the North Bay Police Service received a call \\nfrom a female who was screaming that there was a “psycho” outside her apartment. The \\ninformation received was conflicting, with the caller saying she had either let this person into her \\nresidence, or the male was climbing in through a window. The police were not able to get a full \\ndescription of the perpetrator other than the fact that it was a male. The call came from 866 \\nClarence Street, which is an apartment building in North Bay.  \\nConstable Geoff Whittle \\n[8] \\nCst. Geoff Whittle testified that he was dispatched to attend the Clarence Street address. \\nAs he was nearing the apartment building, he observed a male (later determined to be the \\nrespondent) walking southbound on Clarence Street. The male was wearing dark clothing and had \\na backpack on. The officer described the male as staring at him intently. The officer decided that \\nhe should determine the identity of this person before continuing on.  \\n[9] \\nCst. Whittle turned his vehicle around and pulled up behind the respondent, close to the \\nsidewalk. Cst. Whittle put his window down and asked the respondent where he was coming from. \\nThe respondent responded with words like “why the fuck do you care.” Cst. Whittle told the \\nrespondent that he was looking for someone and then asked again where he had been coming from. \\nThe respondent replied that “he didn’t have to say shit to him.” The respondent was belligerent \\nand told the officer to “fuck off’ and began to walk away.  \\n[10] \\nCst. Whittle testified that as the respondent was walking away, he asked him to stop. Cst. \\nWhittle began to get out of his police vehicle and the respondent quickly took several steps towards \\nhim, with his arms extended, and slammed the vehicle door on the officer’s left arm. Cst. Whittle \\ntestified that the respondent said something to the effect of “stay in the fucking car.”     \\n[11] \\nAt this point Cst. Whittle exited the vehicle with the intent of arresting the respondent for \\nassaulting a police officer. Cst. Whittle caught up to the respondent, who was walking southbound, \\nand grabbed him around the collar/shoulder area and said, “what do you think you’re doing \\nslamming a door on me.”  At this point, the respondent grabbed the officer by his vest and the two \\nwere “both kind of grabbing each other.”  \\n[12] \\nCst. Whittle testified that he used his hip to flip the respondent on to the ground. He then \\nwent on top of the respondent and tried to pin him down. At one point he pushed the respondent’s \\nhead down. Another officer arrived and they handcuffed the respondent. Shortly after, they \\nrealized that the respondent’s ankle had been broken.  \\n[13] \\nCst. Whittle testified that he was not significantly injured when the car door was slammed \\non him. At most he suffered a mark or marks.  \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nConstable Ryan Schreyer \\n[14] \\nCst. Schreyer testified that he was responding to the same call when he observed a police \\nvehicle pulled over on the east shoulder of Clarence Street.  \\n[15] \\nAs Cst. Schreyer drove by, he noticed that Cst. Whittle was still in the police vehicle and \\nthere was a male standing on the sidewalk median area, either on the sidewalk or the grass area, \\non the driver’s side of the police vehicle.  \\n[16] \\nCst. Schreyer testified that he drove by slowly. When he looked back in his passenger side \\nwindow, he saw Cst. Whittle on the ground wrestling with the male. This all occurred within \\nseconds.  \\n[17] \\nHe quickly turned around to provide assistance. When Cst. Schreyer arrived, Cst. Whittle \\nwas slightly on top of the male, attempting to gain control of him. Cst. Schreyer assisted in \\nhandcuffing the male. When they stood the male up, he began to complain of pain in his leg. \\nAccording to Cst. Schreyer, he could see that the male’s ankle was obviously broken.  \\nSergeant Jason Long \\n[18] \\nSgt. Long testified that he was also responding to the original call and driving along \\nClarence Street when he observed Cst. Whittle’s police vehicle parked on the east side of the road. \\nSgt. Long pulled over on the same side of the street facing Cst. Whittle’s police vehicle. \\n[19] \\nSgt. Long testified that he observed Cst. Whittle and Cst. Schreyer on the sidewalk over a \\nmale who was face down on the sidewalk. The male was yelling, swearing, and complaining of a \\nsore ankle. When Sgt. Long looked at male’s ankle, he could tell that it was obviously broken. Sgt. \\nLong called for an ambulance.  \\n[20] \\nSgt. Long directed Cst. Schreyer to remove the handcuffs. The male tried to get up and he \\ntold the male to stay down on the ground. His concern was that the male would further injure his \\nankle if he tried to stand on it. Sgt. Long remained with the male and reassured him that an \\nambulance was on its way. He arranged for a blanket and later assisted in loading the male into an \\nambulance. Sgt. Long then followed behind in his police vehicle and attended the hospital.  \\nMichael Lemieux \\n[21] \\nThe respondent testified that he was walking down the street when a vehicle pulled up and \\nsomeone yelled at him “where are you going?”  He looked over and said, “none of your business.”  \\n[22] \\nThe respondent testified that the vehicle turned around and pulled up beside him. At this \\npoint he could tell it was a police vehicle. The officer in the vehicle asked him what his name was, \\nand the respondent replied, “what’s your name” and kept walking. The officer tried to engage him \\nagain and the respondent told him that he did not want to talk to him and to leave him alone. The \\nrespondent kept walking.  \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n[23] \\nThe respondent testified that on the third occasion the police vehicle pulled up over the \\ncurb, on to the grass, and the side mirror almost hit him. The officer went to open the door of the \\npolice vehicle and the respondent immediately put his hands out and closed the door. The \\nrespondent testified that the door wasn’t open even two inches and the car door did not hit the \\nofficer’s legs or body. The respondent testified that he was getting scared and wanted to stop things \\nbefore they proceeded any further.  \\n[24] \\nThe respondent was challenged in cross-examination about the location of Cst. Whittle’s \\npolice vehicle. The respondent insisted that the vehicle was not on the road, it was on the sidewalk/ \\ngrass/boulevard.  \\n[25] \\nThe respondent testified that after closing the door, he walked away. As he was doing this, \\nhe could feel the back of his leg getting stepped on or pulled to the ground and someone tugging \\non his backpack. He turned around and the officer flipped him over his hip onto the ground. The \\nrespondent testified that the police continued to beat him while he was on the ground, smashing \\nhis face repeatedly into the ground.  \\n[26] \\nThe respondent testified that he was taken to the hospital by ambulance where they \\nconfirmed that his ankle was broken. According to the respondent, Sgt. Long accompanied him in \\nthe ambulance and that they had a conversation about what happened. The respondent was \\nchallenged in cross-examination about Sgt. Long being in the ambulance and he maintained that \\nhe was 100 percent sure Stg. Long was in the ambulance and rode with him to the hospital. The \\nrespondent testified that Sgt. Long was sitting in the corner by the door of the ambulance and that \\nthey talked about him providing a blood sample.  \\n[27] \\nThe respondent testified that he had other injuries as a result of the beating and photographs \\nwere entered as exhibits at trial depicting injuries to the respondent’s face.  \\nPrinciples of Law \\nThe standard of review \\n[28] \\nThe appellant brought this appeal under s.830 of the Criminal Code which provides that \\nthe Crown may appeal against a verdict of acquittal of a summary conviction court on the ground \\nthat: (a) It is erroneous in point of law; (b) it is in excess of jurisdiction; or (c) it constitutes a \\nrefusal or failure to exercise jurisdiction.  \\n[29] \\nThe Crown as an appellant is not entitled to contest an acquittal on the basis of an error of \\nfact or of mixed fact and law. This precludes the Crown from arguing that an acquittal was \\nunreasonable or, provided the trial judge took a legally correct approach to the evidence, that the \\nverdict was not supported by the evidence:  R. v. Rudge, 2011 ONCA 791 at para. 35; R. v. Morin, \\n[1992] 3 S.C.R. 286 (S.C.C.) at pp. 294-295; R. v. B.(G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57 (S.C.C.)  \\n[30] \\nOn a Crown appeal, the Crown must not only establish that the trial judge erred in law, it \\nmust go on and demonstrate with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the verdict would not \\nnecessarily have been the same had the error not been made. In doing so, the Crown is not required \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nto demonstrate that the verdict would necessarily have been different: R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC \\n16, at para. 14; R. v. Rudge, at para. 36.  \\n[31] \\n Acquittals are not lightly overturned. The onus on the Crown as appellant to show that the \\nverdict would not necessarily have been the same had the errors not occurred is a “heavy one” and \\nthe Crown must meet this onus with a reasonably degree of certainty:  R. v. Sutton, 2000 SCC 50 \\nat para. 2. \\n[32] \\nThe Crown, as appellant, cannot appeal from an acquittal on the sole basis that it is \\nunreasonable. The concept of an “unreasonable acquittal” is incompatible with the presumption of \\ninnocence and the burden which rests on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable \\ndoubt: R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15 at paras. 32-33.  \\nCredibility  \\n[33] \\nTrial judges are uniquely placed to assess the credibility of witnesses and their findings of \\ncredibility at trial attract significant deference on appeal unless a palpable and overriding error can \\nbe shown. As such, appellate intervention based on a trial judges’ credibility findings will be rare:   \\nRegina v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20 at para. 99; Regina v. Dinardo, 2008 SCC 24 at para. 26; Regina v. \\nGagnon, 2006 SCC 17 at paras.10-11.  \\n[34] \\nWhether a witness is credible is a question of fact:  R. v. J.M., 2021 ONCA 150 at para. 54; \\nR. v. R.G.B., 2012 MBCA 5 at para. 59.  \\n[35] \\nThe Crown cannot appeal on the basis that a trial judge made a credibility assessment that \\nwas unreasonable. Rather, the Crown must establish that the trial judge committed an error in law.   \\nIt is only when reasonable doubt is tainted by a legal error that appellate intervention from acquittal \\nis permitted: R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45 at para. 39; R. v. K.S., 2017 ONCA 307 at para. 11; R. v. \\nL.B., 2024 ONCA 88 at para. 29.  \\nMisapprehension of evidence \\n[36] \\nA misapprehension of evidence renders a trial unfair and results in a miscarriage of justice \\nwhere a trial judge is “mistaken as to the substance of material parts of the evidence and those \\nerrors play an essential part in the reasoning process resulting in a conviction or acquittal.”  R. v. \\nMorrissey (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 at para. 93.  \\n[37] \\nIn R. v. Lohrer, 2004 SCC 80 at para. 2 the Supreme Court defined the stringent standard \\nto be applied in establishing a misapprehension of evidence. If one exists, it must go to substance \\nand not mere detail and play a central part in the reasoning process:  \\nMorrissey, it should be emphasized, describes a stringent standard. \\nThe misapprehension of the evidence must go to the substance rather \\nthan to the detail. It must be material rather than peripheral to the \\nreasoning of the trial judge.  Once those hurdles are surmounted, \\nthere is the further hurdle (the test is expressed as conjunctive rather \\nthan disjunctive) that the errors thus identified must play an essential \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\npart not just in the narrative of the judgment but “in the reasoning \\nprocess resulting in a conviction.  \\nAnalysis \\nReasons for decision  \\n[38] \\nIn his reasons for decision, the trial judge stated that the case centered on the credibility of \\nCst. Whittle and the respondent. The trial judge went on to correctly state that a trial is not a \\ncredibility contest and that he was required to determine whether the Crown had proven, on the \\nwhole of the evidence, the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  \\n[39] \\nThe trial judge then instructed himself as follows:  \\na. If he believed the accused, he must acquit; \\nb. If he did not know whether to believe the accused or the complainant, he must acquit; \\nc. If he did not reject the evidence of the accused, he must acquit; and \\nd. If he rejected and disbelieved the evidence of the accused, he must be convinced \\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown has proven each and every element of the \\noffence.  \\n[40] \\n The trial judge then turned to the assessment of the evidence in this case. In doing so, he \\nreferred to two aspects of the evidence. Firstly, he stated that the respondent was the only person \\nwho testified about the exact location of Cst. Whittle’s police vehicle. As such, he found that the \\nrespondent’s evidence was uncontradicted on this point. Secondly, he found that the contradiction \\nbetween the respondent and Sgt. Long about whether Sgt. Long was in the ambulance while en \\nroute to the hospital could be explained by the fact that the respondent was in extreme pain and \\nshock following his injury.  \\n[41] \\nFollowing this analysis, the trial judge concluded: \\nI therefore accept Mr. Lemieux’s testimony prior to him being grounded by the \\npolice and cannot determine if his recollection of what happened after is incorrect \\ndue to the shock of having his leg broken by the police. \\nUnder those circumstances, I am unable to reject Mr. Lemieux’s evidence, and as \\ndirected by the Supreme Court of Canada I must therefore accept his version of \\nevents. Mr. Lemieux’s own evidence is that he pushed the door and the same came \\ninto contact with Constable Whittle. Using the strict interpretation of an assault this \\nis clearly Mr. Lemieux intentionally applying force that Constable Whittle did not \\nconsent to, however Mr. Lemieux’s action seemed to be a simple reflex of him \\nabout to be hit by the car door. It is not clear that he in fact had intention of hitting \\nConstable Whittle by pushing the door. In my view the doctrine of de minimus non \\ncurat lex also applies by accepting Lemieux’s version of events and any contact by \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nthe door was minimal. Accordingly, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt \\nthat the Crown has proven each and every element of the offence and there will be \\na finding of not guilty on the charge.  \\n[42] \\nAssessing credibility is not a science. The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that it \\nis very difficult for a trial judge to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of \\nimpressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the \\nvarious version of events. That is why, in the absence of a palpable and overriding error by the \\ntrial judge, his/her perceptions should be respected: R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17 at para. 20.  \\n[43] \\nWhere credibility is a determinative issue, deference is in order and intervention will be \\nrare. There is no general requirement that the reasons be so detailed that they allow an Appeal \\nCourt to retry the entire case on appeal. There is no need to prove that the trial judge was alive to \\nand considered all of the evidence or answered each and every argument of counsel: R. v. Dinardo, \\n2008 SCC 24, at para. 30.  \\n[44] \\nA trial judge’s reasons are not to be viewed on a stand-alone, self-contained basis. The \\nsufficiency of reasons is judged not only by what the trial judge has stated, but by what the trial \\njudge has stated in the context of the record, the issues, and the submissions of counsel at trial:  R. \\nv. M. (R.E.) (2008) SCC 51 at para. 37. \\n[45] \\nThe trial judge’s findings of fact in this case are difficult to discern. While he provided a \\nsummary of the testimony at trial, the trial judge did not go on and clearly make findings of fact.  \\n[46] \\nThe trial judge stated that he accepted the respondent’s evidence, but then went on to state \\nthat he was unable to reject the respondent’s evidence and therefore was required to accept the \\nrespondent’s version of events. This appears to be an error. There is a difference between accepting \\na witness’s evidence and not being able to reject a witness’s evidence. However, when I read the \\ntrial judge’s reasons as a whole, I find that what he was attempting to convey was that in \\naccordance with the guidance in R. v. W.D., if he rejected the evidence of the accused but was left \\nin doubt by it, he was required to acquit.  \\n[47] \\nAn appellate court is not given the power to intervene simply because it thinks the trial \\ncourt did a poor job of expressing itself. In R. v. Walker, 2008 SCC at para. 20, the Supreme Court \\nheld: \\nReasons are sufficient if they are responsive to the case’s live issues \\nand the parties’ key arguments.  Their sufficiency should be \\nmeasured not in the abstract, but as they respond to the substance of \\nwhat was in issue.  The trial judge’s duty is satisfied by reasons \\nwhich are sufficient to serve the purpose for which the duty is \\nimposed, i.e. a decision which, having regard to the particular \\ncircumstances of the case, is reasonably ineligible to the parties and \\nprovides the basis for meaningful appellate review of the correctness \\nof the trial judge’s decision…Moreover “where it is plain from the \\nrecord why an accused has been convicted or acquitted, and the \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nabsence or inadequacy of reasons provides no significant \\nimpediment to the exercise of the right of appeal, the appeal court \\nwill not on that account intervene”…  The duty to gives reasons \\n“should be given a functional and purposeful interpretation” and \\nfailure to live up to the duty does not provide “a free-standing right \\nof appeal” or “in itself confer entitlement to appellate intervention.  \\n[48] \\nIn the circumstances of this case, when read as a whole, the reasons for decision \\ndemonstrate that the trial judge had doubt with respect to whether the Crown had proven, beyond \\na reasonable doubt, the intent required for assault. \\n[49] \\nThe trial judge found that the respondent’s actions seemed to be a reflex action and that it \\ndid not appear that he had the intent to hit Cst. Whittle with the car door.  \\n[50] \\nA reflexive action can negate both the actus reus and mens rea for the offence of assault. \\nA reflexive action can be viewed as an involuntary act over which the accused has no control. This \\nnegates the actus reus. It can also be viewed as an immediate and unpremeditated response to an \\nexternal stimulus and therefore although the accused acted voluntarily, he did so without conscious \\nthought. This negates the mens rea: R. v. Mullin (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 476 (P.E.I. C.A.); R. v. \\nPirozzi (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (Ont.C.A.); R. v. Wolfe (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 382 (Ont.C.A.); \\nR. v. Starratt (1971), 1 O.R. 227 (Ont.C.A.); R. v. Fontaine, 2017 SKCA 72.  \\n[51] \\nIn this case, the respondent testified that he pushed the door shut. As such, this was not a \\ncase where the accused had no voluntary control over his physical actions.  \\n[52] \\nHowever, on the totality of the evidence, it was open to the trial judge to have doubt about \\nwhether the respondent intended to close the door on Cst. Whittle. The respondent’s evidence was \\nthat he immediately put his hands out and closed the door. The respondent testified that the door \\nwasn’t open even two inches and the car door did not hit the officer’s legs or body. The respondent \\ntestified that he was getting scared and wanted to stop things before they proceeded any further. \\nIn those circumstances, it cannot be said that the trial judge erred in law in having doubt about \\nwhether the respondent’s actions were an immediate and unconsidered response to the situation.  \\n[53] \\nThat determines this appeal. \\nDid the trial judge misapprehend the evidence? \\n[54] \\nThe appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence when he found that \\nthe respondent’s evidence about the location of Cst. Whittle’s vehicle was the only evidence on \\nthis issue and as such was uncontradicted.  \\n[55] \\nIn his reasons, the trial judge stated: “No one else testifies as to where the vehicle stopped \\nin relation to the road or the curb. Accordingly, Mr. Lemieux’s testimony on this point is not \\ncontradicted.”  \\n[56] \\nIn my view, the trial judge did misapprehend the evidence on this issue.  \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\n[57] \\nFirstly, there was other evidence about where Cst. Whittle’s vehicle was parked. Cst. \\nSchreyer testified that the vehicle was parked on the east shoulder of Clarence Street. Sgt. Long \\ntestified that the vehicle was parked on the east side of the road and that he parked his vehicle \\nfacing Cst. Whittle’s vehicle. \\n[58] \\nSecondly, the Crown witnesses, Cst. Whittle, Cst. Schreyer or Sgt. Long, were not cross-\\nexamined or challenged on their evidence about where Cst. Whittle’s police vehicle was parked. \\nThe first time the court heard any suggestion that Cst. Whittle’s police vehicle was parked up over \\nthe curb was in the respondent’s evidence.  \\n[59] \\nThe rule in Browne v. Dunn requires that if a party intends to impeach a witness called by \\nan opposite party, the party who seeks to impeach must give the witness an opportunity while the \\nwitness is in the witness box to provide any explanation that the witness may have for the \\ncontradictory evidence. R. v. Quansah, 2015 ONCA 237 at para. 75.  \\n[60] \\nFailure to cross-examine a witness at all on a specific issue tends to support an inference \\nthat the opposing party accepts the witness’s evidence in its entirety or at least on the specific \\npoint. This implied acceptance disentitles the opposing party to later challenge the witness’s \\nevidence on this point in closing submissions or rely on it in inviting the trier of fact to disbelieve \\ntheir evidence. R. v. Quansah, at para. 79.  \\n[61] \\nWhile the rule in Browne v. Dunn does not require that the opposing party put every piece \\nof evidence that they intend to contradict the witness on, cross-examination should confront the \\nwitness with matters of substance, which are critical issues of fact, on which the party seeks to \\nimpeach the witness’s credibility.  R. v. Quansah, at para. 81.  \\n[62] \\nIn this case, the trial judge erroneously disregarded the rule in Browne v. Dunn in his ruling \\nand that worked an unfairness to the Crown’s case.  \\n[63] \\nHaving found that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence with respect to where Cst. \\nWhittle’s vehicle was parked, I must go on and consider whether the appellant has established that \\nthat the error identified played an essential part not just in the narrative of the judgment but in the \\nreasoning process resulting in the acquittal. \\n[64] \\nIn my view, the location of Cst. Whittle’s vehicle did not play an essential part in the \\nreasoning process resulting in an acquittal in this case. Even if the trial judge found that Cst. \\nWhittle’s vehicle was parked on the side of the road, as opposed to up over the curb, Cst. Whittle’s \\nvehicle had to be sufficiently close that the respondent was able to respond quickly and push the \\ndoor closed before Cst. Whittle was able to get fully out of the vehicle.  \\n[65] \\nI am unable to conclude that the misapprehension of the evidence on this point was such \\nthat it played an integral part of the reasoning process that resulted in an acquittal.  \\nDid the trial judge err in applying the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex?  \\n[66] \\nAfter finding that it was unclear whether the respondent had the intent to hit Cst. Whittle, \\nthe trial judge went on to find, in the alternative, that the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nshould be applied to the events because any contact by the door was minimal and Cst. Whittle \\nsuffered no significant injuries.  \\n[67] \\nThe appellant submits that the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex did not apply to the \\ncircumstances of this case. I agree.  \\n[68] \\nIt remains unclear whether the principle of de minimis non curat lex operates as a defence \\nin Canadian criminal law. To date the Supreme Court of Canada and the Ontario Court of Appeal \\nhave declined to recognize or reject its existence in criminal proceedings:  Canadian Foundation \\nfor Children, Youth, & the Law v. Canada (Attorney General) (2004), 180 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) \\nat para. 44; R. v. Kubassek, [2004] O.J. No. 3483 at para.18.    \\n[69] \\nIn R. v. Yombo, the Quebec Court of Appeal appeared to recognize the utility of the doctrine \\nto prevent abuses of process in criminal proceedings, but the court noted that the doctrine would \\nonly apply in exceptional circumstances or in the “clearest or most obvious cases”: R. v. Yombo, \\n2023 QCCA 12 at para. 16. \\n[70] \\nWhether a case qualified for application of the doctrine of de minimis is a question of law. \\nAn appellate court may therefore review the decision according to the standard of correctness. \\nHowever, deference is owed to the underlying findings of fact: R. v. Yombo, at para. 17.  \\n[71] \\nIn this case, the trial judge appeared to conclude that because the contact between the door \\nand the officer was minimal and the officer did not suffer significant injuries the de minimis \\nprinciple should be applied. In my view the trial judge erred in this regard.  \\n[72] \\nThe offence of simple assault does not require proof that the victim was injured. Indeed, \\nthe offence of simple assault covers many circumstances where there is no injury at all. Further, \\nthe offence of simple assault does not require that the intentional application of force be substantial. \\n[73] \\nIn this case there were no clear findings of fact on which the trial judge applied this \\ndoctrine. If the trial judge applied the doctrine of de minimis to a finding of fact that the respondent \\nintentionally closed the vehicle door on the officer, then this was an error. Intentionally slamming \\nor closing a door on another person is an assault worthy of sanction.  \\nThe Charter issues \\n[74] \\nThe appellant appeals against the trial judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s s. 7 and s. \\n9 Charter rights were violated. The appellant further appeals against the trial judge’s conclusion \\nthat the only appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter.  \\n[75] \\nBoth parties have asked that I comment on the correctness of the trial judge’s decision \\nregardless of my conclusion with respect to the conviction appeal. The appellant submits that the \\ntrial judge’s findings on the Charter application must be addressed given the high public interest \\nin ensuring that the police understand that they may make general inquiries while responding to \\nserious calls for service late at night.  \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n[76] \\nI would note that the trial judge purported to stay the proceedings after acquitting the \\naccused. Technically, there were no proceedings to stay at that point, so his Charter decision is a \\nnullity.  \\n[77] \\nGiven my conclusion with respect to the conviction appeal, I find that it is not necessary \\nnor useful for me to provide further comment on the reasons for decision with respect to the \\nCharter application. Any analysis that I would provide would add little to the existing \\njurisprudence about the scope of police powers to investigate crime, or about detention and s. 9 of \\nthe Charter.  \\n[78] \\nThe difficulty in this case is that the trial judge did not make clear findings of fact upon \\nwhich his Charter analysis can be assessed. He did not address the evidential burden.  He did not \\naddress which evidence he accepted, which evidence he rejected, and why. It may be that he \\naccepted the respondent’s evidence, but that is unclear on the record before me.   \\n[79] \\nIn a criminal trial the burden always rests on the Crown to prove each and every essential \\nelement of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a high standard of proof. Where the \\naccused brings an application alleging violations of s. 7 and s. 9 of the Charter, the legal and \\nevidentiary onus rests primarily on the accused as applicant to establish, on a balance of \\nprobabilities, that there has been a violation.  \\n[80] \\n Without clear findings of fact, I am simply not in a position to review the correctness of \\nthe trial judge’s conclusion with respect to the respondent’s Charter application.  Findings of fact \\nare crucial to appellate review.  \\n[81] \\nMy decision to not address the trial judge’s decision on the Charter application should not \\nbe construed as my agreement with the decision.  I am simply unable to conduct an appropriate \\nappellate analysis.  \\nConclusion  \\n[82] \\nOn a Crown appeal, the appellant must establish not only that the trial judge erred in law \\nbut must also go on and demonstrate with a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdict would \\nnot have necessarily been the same had the error not been made. \\n[83] \\nWhile I have found that legal errors occurred in this case, I find that the appellant has not \\nmet the further requirement of demonstrating that the verdict would not have necessarily been the \\nsame had those errors not been made.  \\n[84] \\nWhen the trial judge’s reasons are read as a whole, they demonstrate that he was left in \\ndoubt with respect to whether the respondent possessed the intent required for assault. I find that \\nthe legal errors identified in this case do not impact that overall assessment or conclusion.   \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1878 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\n[85] \\nFor these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.  \\n \\n \\n \\nJustice S.K.

Akbarali J. \\nCOUNSEL: Mohammad Reza Baybourd, in person  \\nCalvin Zhang, for the defendant  \\nHEARD: \\nMarch 27, 2024 \\nENDORSEMENT \\nOverview \\n[1] \\nThe plaintiff was a client of the defendant law firm. When a billing dispute arose between \\nthem, the plaintiff took steps to assess the defendant’s accounts, and the defendant obtained an \\norder removing itself from the record. \\n[2] \\nThe order for assessment, dated January 20, 2023, attached invoices dating back to August \\n2018. After the order for assessment was obtained, the defendant issued two further invoices to \\nthe plaintiff. \\n[3] \\nThe defendant brings this motion for an order quashing or dismissing the order for \\nassessment the plaintiff has obtained on the basis that the request to assess the accounts was made \\noutside the 30-day time period provided for in s. 3 of the Solicitors Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 15, and \\nthat the plaintiff has not proven that there are special circumstances, as required by s. 4(1) of the \\nSolicitors Act, to require the assessment.  \\n[4] \\nThe plaintiff argues, first, that because invoices were delivered after the order for \\nassessment was obtained, he is within the time frame set out in s. 3 of the Solicitors Act, and \\nalternatively, if he is not, special circumstances are present in this case. \\nAnalysis \\n[5] \\nI will assume without deciding that the delivery of the invoices after the plaintiff obtained \\nthe order for assessment, which obviously were not attached to the order for assessment because \\n2024 ONSC 1882 (CanLII)\\n- Page 2 - \\n \\nthey had not yet been delivered, does not relieve the plaintiff of the burden of demonstrating that \\nspecial circumstances exist that require the assessment of the earlier accounts. I note that counsel \\non this motion indicated that they would not object to the plaintiff proceeding with an assessment \\nof the accounts that were delivered after the order for assessment was obtained. \\n[6] \\nThe question is thus whether the plaintiff has met his burden to show special circumstances \\nin order to proceed with the order for assessment.  \\n[7] \\nIn 11138120 Canada Inc. v. Rizk, 2023 ONSC 2461, Ryan Bell J. recently set out the \\nrelevant law where the question at issue is whether there are special circumstances such that the \\nsolicitor’s accounts, (here, those delivered prior to December 21, 2022) can be considered for \\nassessment. I adopt her articulation of the law at paras. 9-12: \\n[9]               Section 3 of the Solicitors Act provides: \\nWhere the retainer of the solicitor is not disputed and there are no special \\ncircumstances, an order may be obtained on requisition from a local \\nregistrar of the Superior Court of Justice, \\n(a)   by the client, for the delivery and assessment of the solicitor’s bill; \\n(b)   by the client, for the assessment of a bill already delivered, within \\none month from its delivery; \\n(c)   by the solicitor, for the assessment of a bill already delivered, at any \\ntime after the expiration of one month from its delivery, if no order \\nfor its assessment has been previously made. \\n[10]           Section 4(1) provides: \\nNo such reference shall be directed upon an application made by the \\nparty chargeable with such bill after a verdict or judgment has been \\nobtained, or after twelve months from the time such bill was delivered, \\nsent or left as aforesaid, except under special circumstances to be proved \\nto the satisfaction of the court or judge to whom the application for the \\nreference is made. \\n[11]           The payment of a bill does not preclude assessment if the special \\ncircumstances of the case, in the court’s opinion, appear to require the \\nassessment: Solicitors Act, s. 11. \\n[12]           The words “special circumstances” imply that the court has a broad \\ndiscretion to determine the matter having regard to all the circumstances in the case; \\n“‘[s]pecial circumstances’ are those in which the importance of protecting the \\ninterests of the client and/or public confidence in the administration of justice, \\ndemand an assessment”: Clatney v. Quinn Thiele Mineault Grodzki LLP, 2016 \\n2024 ONSC 1882 (CanLII)\\n- Page 3 - \\n \\nONCA 377, at paras. 84 and 86. In Clatney, at para. 87, the Court of Appeal for \\nOntario identified the relevant circumstances as including but not limited to: \\n•         the sophistication of the client; \\n•         the adequacy of communications between solicitor and client \\nconcerning the accounts; \\n•         whether there is evidence of increasing lack of satisfaction by the \\nclient regarding the services relating to the accounts; \\n•         whether there is overcharging for services provided; \\n•         the extent of detail of the bills; \\n•         whether the solicitor-client relationship is ongoing; and \\n•         whether payments can be characterized as involuntary.  \\n[8] \\nI am satisfied on this record that the special circumstances of this case, which I describe \\nbelow, appear to require the assessment of all of the accounts rendered to the plaintiff by the \\ndefendant during the course of the retainer. \\n[9] \\nFirst, almost all of the defendant’s bills lack detail, in that there is no disclosure of the time \\nspent on the steps in the action, or of the timekeepers who undertook those steps, in any bill until \\nat least late August 2022.  \\n[10] \\nIt is relevant to note that the plaintiff moved his file, dealing with a single action relating \\nto a commercial lease and partnership agreement, to the defendant firm after discoveries were \\ncompleted by previous counsel. The plaintiff left his previous counsel, at least in part, because the \\nplaintiff was frustrated that his previous counsel had not been able to obtain answers to an \\nundertaking made by the defendant in that litigation to produce bank records. Thus, at the time the \\ndefendant took over the file, the action had progressed a substantial way towards trial. \\n[11] \\nThe defendant’s accounts total over $66,000 which seem to relate to getting up to speed on \\nthe file, attending a brief pre-trial that was adjourned due to an amendment of the plaintiff’s claim, \\ncommencing a motion for production that the plaintiff deposes was not authorized, and perhaps \\nattending a mediation where no offers were exchanged. No trial date has yet been set. \\n[12] \\nThe plaintiff argues that the amount billed is out of proportion to progress made in the \\naction, but it is impossible to properly analyze the bills given that they include no detail with \\nrespect to time spent on the different tasks identified.  \\n[13] \\nSecond, the record indicates that the plaintiff asked for detailed bills, including time spent \\nby the timekeepers on different tasks, and he received no response to his request. No detailed bills \\nwere provided except on a go-forward basis commencing sometime in late August or September \\n2024 ONSC 1882 (CanLII)\\n- Page 4 - \\n \\n2022. The plaintiff did not receive any information about the timekeepers or the time spent in \\nrespect of the bills that had been previously delivered. \\n[14] \\nMoreover, there are emails in the record that indicate that, as soon as the plaintiff raised \\nquestions about the bills, the response he received from the defendant was aggressive. For \\nexample, after the plaintiff paid about $57,000, with about $6,700 in invoices outstanding, and \\nafter he raised questions about the account, counsel emailed the plaintiff and said, among other \\nthings: \\nIf the outstanding accounts are not paid no further [sic] can be undertaken. It is up \\nto you whether you want to keep the action moving forward or not. If our accounts \\nare not paid this week I will have to remove my firm as lawyers of record in the \\nnew year which is not to your benefit. I do not accept your reason for not paying \\nmonths after the accounts were delivered and without any issues raised by you. I \\ndo not agree with your comments now about the motion or obtaining the defendants \\n[sic] financial statements and tax returns. If you have a concern about specific \\nentries in our statements of accounts I will look at them but not on the basis you \\nhave stated in your email. \\n[15] \\nRather than engage with the plaintiff meaningfully about his concerns, counsel moved \\nstraight to an ultimatum.  \\n[16] \\nIn addition, the plaintiff deposes that he sought a meeting with counsel to discuss the \\naccounts, but was told that in order to secure a meeting with counsel, he would have to first pay \\nthe accounts. An email from the defendant at the time disputes that narrative, but the defendant \\ndid not address that allegation in the affidavit evidence filed in the record, so I have only hearsay \\nevidence from the defendant on the point. \\n[17] \\nI conclude that communications between the solicitor and client concerning the accounts \\nwere not adequate. \\n[18] \\nThird, the record raises concerns with respect to over-charging. I have already noted that \\nover $66,000 was billed for getting up to speed on a file that does not appear, from the pleading at \\nleast, to be more complex than average, for attending a pre-trial that adjourned after a very short \\nperiod of time, for amending a pleading, and perhaps for a mediation that did not result in a single \\noffer. \\n[19] \\nAt the same time, the invoices in the record reveal charges for items that I find concerning. \\nFor example, the plaintiff’s evidence is that he did not authorize a production motion, yet he was \\nbilled for work undertaken in connection with one. It also appears that counsel charged the plaintiff \\nfor the time he spent writing emails to the plaintiff with respect to the plaintiff’s questions about \\nhis account, which I find astonishing. \\n[20] \\nIn an account delivered after the order for assessment was obtained, the defendant billed \\nthe plaintiff over $2,500 in connection with its motion to get off the record, although there is no \\nindication that the motion was opposed. Costs were not sought in the notice of motion, and there \\n2024 ONSC 1882 (CanLII)\\n- Page 5 - \\n \\nwas no provision ordering costs in the order signed by Associate Justice Frank. By billing the \\nplaintiff for the motion, with respect to which the parties were, at least theoretically, adverse in \\ninterest, the defendant in effect charged him full indemnity fees, when a successful party on an \\nopposed motion is presumptively entitled to partial indemnity fees. I recognize that this account is \\nnot technically in issue before me, in view of counsel’s statement that the defendant does not object \\nto the plaintiff assessing the accounts delivered after the order for assessment was obtained, but \\nespecially in view of the lack of detail in the earlier accounts, the defendant’s billing practices raise \\nconcerns more broadly, and appear to warrant scrutiny to guard against overcharging. \\n[21] \\nThe detailed accounts delivered after the parties’ email exchange reveal that there were at \\nleast three timekeepers involved in the plaintiff’s file at that time, though it is not clear to me why \\nstaffing the account in this way was required. I have no idea how many lawyers were involved at \\nearlier stages of the file, because, as I have noted, for the first four years of the retainer, the \\ntimekeepers were not disclosed on the bill. Moreover, the invoices disclose inter-office \\ndiscussions, emails, and reporting, all of which becomes more expensive when more people are \\ninvolved in the file.  \\n[22] \\nI also note that counsel who appeared on this motion does not appear to be one of the \\nlawyers whose work is disclosed on the bill in December 2022, leading me to wonder if in fact \\nthere were four lawyers involved in this file. (I recognize that it is possible that a clerk or student \\nwas also a timekeeper, but the bill itself describes the timekeepers as lawyers.) \\n[23] \\nI am cognizant that the plaintiff paid his bills throughout voluntarily and without complaint \\nuntil the billing dispute arose between the parties. However, as I have already noted, the payment \\nof bills does not preclude assessment of those bills if, in the court’s view, special circumstances \\nrequire it. \\n[24] \\nThe defendant submitted that the plaintiff was a sophisticated businessperson, and relied \\non the statement of claim in the plaintiff’s action, and the emails the plaintiff sent complaining \\nabout his account to establish the plaintiff’s sophistication. The statement of claim (which consists \\nof allegations) makes no assertion that the plaintiff is particularly sophisticated. I note that the \\ncommercial lease and partnership agreement at issue in that litigation relate to a sandwich shop \\nand the claim alleges that the plaintiff was defrauded by his partners. The emails in the record \\nindicate that the plaintiff can express himself. In my view, this evidence does not establish any \\nparticular sophistication on the part of the plaintiff. \\n[25] \\nFor these reasons, I find that special circumstances exist that appear to require the \\nassessment.  I exercise my discretion to permit the plaintiff’s order for assessment to proceed. The \\ndefendant’s motion is dismissed. \\nCosts \\n[26] \\nThe three main purposes of modern costs rules are to indemnify successful litigants for the \\ncosts of litigation, to encourage settlement, and to discourage and sanction inappropriate behaviour \\nby litigants: see Fong v. Chan (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 330, at para. 22. \\n2024 ONSC 1882 (CanLII)\\n- Page 6 - \\n \\n[27] \\nSubject to the provisions of an act or the rules of this court, costs are in the discretion of \\nthe court, pursuant to s. 131 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43. The court exercises \\nits discretion considering the factors enumerated in r. 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, \\nincluding the principle of indemnity, the reasonable expectations of the unsuccessful party, and \\nthe complexity and importance of the issues. Overall, costs must be fair and reasonable: see \\nBoucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (Ont. \\nC.A.), at para. 38. A costs award should reflect what the court views as a fair and reasonable \\ncontribution by the unsuccessful party to the successful party rather than any exact measure of the \\nactual costs to the successful litigant: see Zesta Engineering Ltd. v. Cloutier (2002), 21 C.C.E.L. \\n(3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 4. \\n[28] \\nIn this motion, the plaintiff is the successful party, and is presumptively entitled to his \\ncosts. \\n[29] \\nThe plaintiff argued that he is entitled to costs at the same level claimed by the defendant, \\nthat is, about $8,000 on a partial indemnity scale or $12,000 on a substantial indemnity scale. \\n[30] \\nHowever, the plaintiff is self-represented. Self-represented parties are entitled to costs, but \\nnot with respect to the time and effort any litigant would have devoted to their case. Rather, lay \\nlitigants are entitled to costs if they can demonstrate that they devoted time and effort to do the \\nwork ordinarily done by a lawyer retained to conduct the litigation and that they incurred an \\nopportunity cost by forgoing remunerative activity: Fong, at para. 24. \\n[31] \\nThe plaintiff has taken time off work to deal with the defendant’s motion. I conclude that \\nsome level of costs is appropriate.  \\n[32] \\nI find that costs of $500 are fair and reasonable.

Section 3 of \\nthe Act prohibits the solicitation of persons doing certain things in certain places. Section \\n5 of the Act provides that upon conviction for an offence under the Act, a person is liable \\nto a fine or, upon a subsequent conviction a fine or imprisonment. Taken together, the Act \\n“prohibits begging and panhandling in specific circumstances and, together with a \\nprovision of the Highway Traffic Act, entirely bans the activity of ‘squeegeeing’ and the \\nsolicitation of people in vehicles on a roadway.”2  \\n[2] \\nThe legal clinic Fair Change brings this constitutional challenge to ss. 2, 3, and 5 of the \\nAct. Fair Change, supported by all of the interveners, submits that the Act violates several \\nprovisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including freedom of \\nexpression (s.2(b)), the right not to be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person \\nexcept in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice (s. 7), the presumption of \\ninnocence (s. 11(d)), the right to be free from cruel or unusual treatment or punishment (s. \\n12), and the right to equality for individuals with mental health illnesses and addictions, \\nIndigenous people, LGBTQ people, youth, and individuals in receipt of social assistance \\n(s. 15). \\n[3] \\nThe role of the court on this application is limited. The court is not to determine the efficacy \\nor advisability of the Act. The court is not to select which of the parties’ competing \\nperspectives on criminology it prefers. The court cannot determine whether or not social \\nassistance rates in the province are set at a fair or optimal level. The court is not tasked \\nwith assessing if public funds could be spent better elsewhere than policing solicitation. \\nThe court’s role is only to determine based on the evidence placed before it whether or not \\nthe Act is constitutional.  \\n[4] \\nFirst, I uphold the constitutionality of s. 2(2) of the Act, which prohibits soliciting in an \\naggressive manner, meaning one that is likely to cause a reasonable person to be concerned \\nfor his or her safety and security. In my view, that prohibition is a justified limitation on \\nfreedom of expression as it is a minimally impairing and proportionate limit on the right.  \\n[5] \\nThe Act goes further, however, and, in s. 2(3) deems six of activities to be soliciting in an \\naggressive manner contrary to s. 2(2). For example, paragraph 2(3)5 of the Act states that \\na person soliciting while intoxicated by drugs or alcohol is deemed to be soliciting in a \\nmanner that is likely to cause a reasonable person to be concerned for his or her safety and \\nsecurity. With one exception, I find the deeming provisions in s. 2(3) to be unconstitutional \\nviolations of the presumption of innocence. Five of the deeming provisions violate well-\\n                                                 \\n \\n1 The long title is “An Act to promote safety in Ontario by prohibiting aggressive solicitation, solicitation of persons \\nin certain places and disposal of dangerous things in certain places, and to amend the Highway Traffic Act to \\nregulate certain activities on the roadways”, S.O. 1999, c. 8. \\n2 R. v. Banks, 2007 ONCA 19, 84 O.R. (3d) 1 (“Banks CA”), at para. 4. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nestablished constitutional rules that prohibit legislation substituting proof of one fact for \\nproof of an essential element of the offence except where proof of the substituted fact leads \\ninexorably to the conclusion that the Crown has proved the essential element. Other than \\nparagraph 2(3)1, the deeming provisions of the Act do not meet this high standard and the \\nlimitation on the presumption of innocence is not justified under s. 1 of the Charter. \\n[6] \\nSecond, I uphold the constitutionality of some, but not all, of the restrictions found in s. 3 \\nof the Act, which prohibit soliciting persons doing certain things in certain places. This is \\nnot the first constitutional challenge to the Act. In 2007, the Court of Appeal upheld the \\nconstitutionality of s. 3(2)(f) of the Act, which prohibits squeegeeing.3 Fair Change \\nchallenged that provision again before me on a broader range of constitutional grounds. \\nFor the reasons set out below, I do not accept Fair Change’s submissions. The Act’s \\nprohibition against squeegeeing remains constitutional. \\n[7] \\nClauses 3(2)(a) to (e) of the Act, however, go further and prohibit the solicitation of persons \\ndoing things in places other than in a roadway. I find that those restrictions limit freedom \\nof expression and are not minimally impairing of the right because they capture many \\nsolicitations that would not interfere with the free and safe use of public spaces and would \\npose no danger to or harassment of persons using those public spaces.  \\n[8] \\nAs I will explain below, I do not accept that any provision of the Act constitutes cruel and \\nunusual punishment contrary to s. 12 of the Charter. Other than paragraphs 2(3)2 to 6 of \\nthe Act, which violate the presumption of innocence, the Act does not violate anyone’s \\nright to life, liberty, or security of the person contrary to s. 7 of the Charter. Based on the \\nevidence in the record, I find that Fair Change has not demonstrated that the Act has a \\ndisproportionate impact on members of a protected group contrary to s. 15 of the Charter. \\n[9] \\nTo the extent that I have found that some provisions of the Act are unconstitutional, I \\ndeclare those provisions to be of no force and effect pursuant to section 52 of the \\nConstitution Act, 1982. \\n[10] \\nI will organize my reasons for decision as follows.  \\n[11] \\nFirst, I will address some preliminary issues and provide necessary context and background \\nto the constitutional issues in dispute. I will organize this section of my reasons into the \\nfollowing parts: \\n1. \\nPublic interest standing for Fair Change \\n2. \\nThe evidence on the application: admissibility and weight \\n3. \\nThe scheme of the Act  \\n                                                 \\n \\n3 Banks CA. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n4. \\nThe scheme of the Provincial Offences Act \\n5. \\nThe prior decisions in R. v. Banks \\n[12] \\nI will then consider the specific Charter challenges Fair Change and the interveners \\nadvance in this application, including, where necessary, whether any limit on the right can \\nbe justified under s. 1 of the Charter. I will organize this section of my reasons into the \\nfollowing parts: \\n6. \\nSection 11(d) - the presumption of innocence \\n7. \\nSection 2(b) - freedom of expression \\n8. \\nSection 12 - cruel and unusual treatment or punishment \\n9. \\nSection 7 - life, liberty, and security of the person \\n10. \\nSection 15 – the right to equality \\n11.  \\nRemedy \\n12. \\nCosts \\n1. \\nPublic interest standing for Fair Change \\n[13] \\nFair Change is an Ontario not-for-profit corporation founded to provide free legal \\nrepresentation to people in the street community facing charges under the Act. Fair Change \\nhas a legal personality but has not been charged with an offence and its own constitutional \\nrights have not been infringed by the Act. Fair Change does not, therefore, have direct legal \\nstanding to bring this application. For that reason, Fair Change seeks public interest \\nstanding. Importantly, Ontario did not oppose Fair Change’s request.  \\n[14] \\nPublic interest standing allows individuals or organizations to bring cases of public interest \\nbefore the courts even though they are not directly involved in the matter and even though \\ntheir own rights are not infringed.4 The decision whether to grant or deny public interest \\nstanding is discretionary. When exercising its discretion, the court must assess and weigh \\nthree factors: \\na. whether the case raises a serious justiciable issue;  \\nb. whether the party bringing the application has a genuine interest in the matter; and  \\n                                                 \\n \\n4 British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Council of Canadians with Disabilities, 2022 SCC 27, 470 D.L.R. (4th) \\n289, at para. 2. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nc. whether the proposed application is a reasonable and effective means of bringing \\nthe case to court.5  \\n[15] \\nEach factor is to be weighed in light of the underlying purposes that justify limiting \\nstanding and applied in a flexible and generous manner that best serves the purposes of: \\na. efficiently allocating scarce resources and screening out busybody litigants; \\nb. ensuring that courts have the benefit of the contending points of view of those most \\ndirectly affected by the issues; and  \\nc. ensuring that courts play their proper role within our democratic system of \\ngovernance.6  \\n[16] \\nCourts must also consider the purposes that justify granting standing, which include: \\na. giving effect to the principle of legality; and  \\nb. ensuring access to the courts and access to justice.7 \\n[17] \\nIn each case, the goal is to strike a meaningful balance between the purposes that favour \\ngranting public interest standing and those that favour limiting it.  \\n[18] \\nI have no doubt that this case raises a serious justiciable issue, and that Fair Change has a \\ngenuine interest in the matter. It is no busybody. Its work is important, recognized in the \\nmainstream press and legal community, and of enormous credit to its founder and its \\nvolunteers. The evidence filed on this application demonstrates that Fair Change has \\nprovided significant assistance to its clients and furthered their access to justice. \\n[19] \\nMy concern is whether or not this proceeding is a reasonable and effective means to bring \\nthis matter to the court. I must ensure that the court plays its proper role in our democratic \\nsystem of governance. Although I am prepared to grant Fair Change public interest \\nstanding, this was a close call.  \\n[20] \\nThe constitutional challenges in this case could have been brought within proceedings \\nwhere individuals faced charges and where the constitutionality of the Act could have been \\ndetermined on the basis of actual factual disputes arising from specific acts of solicitation.  \\n[21] \\nThe Court of Appeal identified this very concern in its decision in Banks. The court \\ndeclined the invitation of interveners to convert the constitutional issues before the court \\ninto a broader challenge to the constitutionality of the entire Act. The Court of Appeal \\n                                                 \\n \\n5 Council of Canadians with Disabilities, at para. 28; Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence \\nSociety v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 SCC 45, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 524, at para. 20. \\n6 Council of Canadians with Disabilities, at para. 29; Downtown Eastside, at para. 1. \\n7 Council of Canadians with Disabilities, at para. 30; Downtown Eastside, at paras. 20, 23, 36, 39-43, 49-50 and 76. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nexplained that there were other reasonable and effective means of bringing those issues \\nbefore the court: \\nEven if the court’s jurisdiction to accord discretionary public \\ninterest standing had been properly invoked in this case, it could not \\nbe said that there was no other reasonable and effective manner in \\nwhich the question could be brought before the court. Sections 2 and \\n3(2)(a) to (e) could be challenged by persons charged under them. \\nPresumably, there are such persons among the many who counsel \\nfor the Associations stated have been charged under the Act. Such \\nchallenges, if and when they come before the court, will enable the \\ncourt to decide constitutional questions on the basis of actual factual \\ndisputes, rather than on a hypothetical basis. As the Supreme Court \\nof Canada has stated, “Charter cases should not be considered in a \\nfactual vacuum”: Vriend v. Alberta, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 493, [1998] \\nS.C.J. No. 29, at para. 199.8 \\n[22] \\nAs noted above, Fair Change is a legal clinic founded to provide free legal representation \\nto people in the street community facing charges under the Act. In support of its \\napplication, Fair Change filed three affidavits from its clients: \\na. Gerry Williams deposed that in 2016, Fair Change represented him in an appeal \\nthat resulted in $65,000 worth of fines, including some under the Act, being reduced \\nto zero; \\nb. Donald Dunbar deposed that with the help of the clinic, he was able to fight some \\nof his tickets under the Act and to stay out of jail; and \\nc. Margaret Bunting deposed that she worked with Fair Change to have her tickets \\nunder the Act withdrawn or had the sentences suspended, including in a summons \\nwhere incarceration was a potential sentence. \\n[23] \\nThe constitutional arguments advanced by Fair Change in this proceeding could have been \\nmarshalled in support of any of these three clients, or any of the clinic’s other clients facing \\ncharges under the Act. Fair Change could then have played its natural role as counsel in a \\ncase involving its clients.  \\n[24] \\nI am mindful of the evidence of Joanna Nefs, founder and Executive Director of Fair \\nChange, that it was difficult to raise the constitutional issues in cases involving her clients: \\nIn the past, on behalf of Fair Change clients, I have attempted to \\nraise issues with the court relating to the application of the SSA. \\nSpecifically, I have brought issues relating to the use of ex-parte \\ntrials and the potential for jail for defendants with mental health \\n                                                 \\n \\n8 Banks CA, at para. 24. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\ndisabilities under the [Act] and the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. \\n1990, c. p33, (the \"POA\"). In every case where these issues were \\nraised, the Crown chose not to argue the law but rather decided that \\nthe case was \\'not in the interests of justice\\' and withdrew the charges. \\nWhile my individual clients were satisfied with these results, the \\nCrown\\'s approach has prevented the judicial examination of the \\ncurrent application of the [Act]; one cannot appeal a withdrawal. \\nFurther, these withdrawals do nothing to assist the situation of \\nunrepresented accused, nor do they develop the jurisprudence for \\nuse by courts in other jurisdictions. These experiences demonstrate \\nto me that Fair Change has no choice but to apply for public interest \\nstanding, as this is the only way the court will be able to hear these \\nissues. \\n[25] \\nWith respect, I do not accept that Fair Change had no choice but to bring this application \\nin its own name. Over 20 years ago, in Banks, 12 accused were able to mount a \\nconstitutional challenge to provisions of the Act with the assistance of counsel. Moreover, \\nmany of the constitutional issues advanced in this case would arise in each and every case \\nwhere an individual faced charges under the Act and where that person may have been \\nentitled to pursue a constitutional remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and/or the \\ndeclarations of invalidity sought in this proceeding. \\n[26] \\nCourts should not grant public interest standing readily, especially to legal clinics who \\ncould mount the challenge as counsel for their clients. In my view, constitutional litigation \\nis best advanced in a case brought by an individual who has been subject to the challenged \\nstatutory provisions.9 For example, Fair Change seeks to rely on evidence of the \\nunconstitutional administration of the Act. Fair Change filed affidavits in which the \\ndeponents allege that police officers violently assaulted them, abused their official \\ndiscretion to write tickets, or harassed them. If it occurred, such misconduct is deplorable. \\nHowever, the allegations described in the affidavits are entirely devoid of particulars and \\nthe court cannot adjudicate these allegations in this application.  \\n[27] \\nAs mentioned above, Ontario did not oppose Fair Change’s request for public interest \\nstanding. Ontario was content to proceed with the factual record developed by the parties \\nand to have these constitutional issues determined in this adversarial setting. The Attorney \\nGeneral of Ontario is the guardian of the public interest, even if it does not have a monopoly \\non that public interest.10 Where the Attorney General of Ontario takes no issue with the \\ncourt granting public interest standing to an applicant in a constitutional case, that is a \\nsignificant factor in favour of the court exercising its discretion to grant public interest \\nstanding to the applicant. The Attorney General’s considered view satisfies me that the \\n                                                 \\n \\n9 Ontario (Attorney General) v. Bogaerts, 2019 ONCA 876, at paras. 32 and 33. \\n10 Frank v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 ONCA 485, at para. 18. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\ncourt will not be stepping outside of its proper role within our democratic system of \\ngovernance by granting public interest standing to Fair Change.  \\n[28] \\nIn addition, Fair Change commenced this application almost seven years ago. Many \\naffidavits and expert opinions have been filed. The parties have cross-examined 16 people. \\nFive interveners have made written and oral submissions. The parties and the court devoted \\nthree days of court time to this case. While judicial economy is a good reason to be careful \\nabout granting public interest standing, this matter has now had a full hearing and there is \\nlittle efficiency to be gained by not deciding the case. All of these considerations also \\nfavour granting public interest standing. \\n[29] \\nIn all of the circumstances, I exercise my discretion to grant public interest standing to Fair \\nChange.  \\n2. \\nThe evidence on this application: admissibility and weight \\n[30] \\nBefore turning to the specific constitutional issues raised in this application, I will address \\ncertain issues with the evidence.  \\n[31] \\nFair Change filed affidavits from four individuals about their background and experience \\nreceiving tickets under the Act: Gerry Williams, Margaret Bunting, Donald Dunbar, and \\nAshley Roberts. Fair Change also filed fact affidavits from Joanna Nefs (the founder of \\nFair Change) and Hannah Clow (Director of Operations for Fair Change). In addition, Fair \\nChange filed five expert opinions: \\na. Professor William O’Grady, a professor of sociology at the University of Guelph \\nwho teaches mainly in the area of criminology;  \\nb. Dr. Sean Kidd, a clinical psychologist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental \\nHealth and a clinical scientist in CAMH’s complex care and recovery program; \\nc. Professor Joseph Hermer, an associate professor of sociology at the University of \\nToronto;  \\nd. Professor Jonathan L. Freedman, an emeritus professor of psychology; and  \\ne. John Stapleton, the principal of Open Policy, a social policy consulting company. \\n[32] \\nOntario filed fact affidavits from Constable Christian Lamarche (Ottawa Police Service), \\nConstable Douglas Schmidt (London Police Service), Staff Sergeant David McKenzie \\n(Hamilton Police Service), Staff Sergeant Ed Winger (Toronto Transit Commission), \\nMarty Williams (Ontario Business Improvement Area Association), and Pauline Larsen \\n(Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area). Ontario also filed three expert opinions: \\na. Dr. Cheryl Cherpitel, senior scientist at the National Alcohol Research Center, \\nCalifornia; \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nb. Professor David Thacher, associate professor of public policy and urban planning \\nat the University of Michigan; and  \\nc. Professor William Sousa, professor of criminology, University of Nevada Los \\nVegas. \\nThe affidavit of Joanna Nefs \\n[33] \\nMs. Nefs’ 35-paragraph affidavit addressed several topics: the origins and work of the \\nclinic; the ticketing and court process under the Act and the Provincial Offences Act; some \\nstatistics on provincial offences activities; the clinic’s representation of clients facing \\ntickets under the Act; the “importance of panhandling for panhandlers;” the “negative \\nstereotyping of panhandlers;” and the Act’s “harmful effects on panhandlers.” Much of \\nMs. Nefs’ affidavit is unobjectionable. Some parts of the affidavit, however, raise concerns.  \\n[34] \\nRule 4.06(2) restricts the contents of an affidavit to be used in a proceeding to “the \\nstatement of facts within the personal knowledge of the deponent or to other evidence that \\nthe deponent could give if testifying as a witness in court.” Rule 39.01(5), however, creates \\nan exception to the general prohibition on hearsay established in rule 4.06(2) and permits \\nan affidavit on an application to contain statements of the deponent’s information and belief \\nwith respect to facts that are not contentious if the affiant specifies the source of that \\ninformation. \\n[35] \\nSometimes, Ms. Nefs names the former client that provided her with the information that \\ninformed her belief. Occasionally, however, Ms. Nefs’ affidavit is based on information \\nand belief, but she does not identify the source of her information. For example, paragraphs \\n25 and 26 read as follows: \\n25. \\nIn particular, I had one client who had been diagnosed with \\nschizophrenia and lived alone in community housing. His \\nneighbours were involved in the drug trade and, as he was a \\nrecovering addict, he did his best not to interact with the people in \\nhis neighbourhood. He was therefore very socially isolated, but he \\nalways went to the same street corner to panhandle. He told me once \\nthat he would never stop panhandling because his regulars were the \\nonly people who would notice and miss him if he were to die.  \\n26. \\nSigns that ask for ‘smiles’, or express wishes for the reader \\nto “have a good day,” have been treated by police as evidence of \\nillegal solicitation under the SSA. For example, the client in the \\nprevious paragraph used a sign that only indicated he was hungry. \\nThe sign did not specifically ask for money. That person had \\nmultiple charges under the SSA for “soliciting” on a roadway. \\nBefore he was my client he was convicted several times after ex-\\nparte trials. After I began representing him, some of his matters were \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nwithdrawn by the Crown. Other times, justices of the peace rendered \\na verdict of not guilty without providing reasons on the record. \\n[36] \\nMs. Nefs does not provide the identity of the client who was the source of her information \\nand belief. In my view, the requirement to specify the source of the information requires, \\nat a minimum, that the affiant provide the name of the person who provided the information \\nto her.11 I am also concerned that this information came from Ms. Nefs’ former clients, to \\nwhom she continues to owe a duty of confidentiality and to maintain solicitor-client \\ncommunication privilege. The court is placed in an awkward position when it is asked to \\nreceive and consider factual evidence from a witness who owes ongoing duties to the \\nanonymous source of that information.  \\n[37] \\nI understand why Ms. Nefs wanted to put this type of evidence before the court. To some \\ndegree, this type of evidence flows from Fair Change’s decision to bring this application \\nusing public interest standing. I will give Ms. Nefs’ evidence less weight where it is based \\non hearsay and, in particular, hearsay where she does not identify the source of her \\ninformation and belief.  \\nThe affidavits of Gerry Williams and Margaret Bunting \\n[38] \\nOntario challenges the admissibility of the affidavits of Mr. Williams (sworn April 14, \\n2018) and Ms. Bunting (sworn May 1, 2018) because those affiants were not available for \\ncross-examination.  \\n[39] \\nFor the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the affidavits of Mr. Williams and Ms. \\nBunting are necessary and reliable, in the sense that there are sufficient procedural \\nguarantees of reliability to meet the threshold test for reliability. Absent cross-examination, \\nhowever, I am not prepared to give any weight to these affidavits. \\nGerry Williams’ affidavit \\n[40] \\nIn his 53-paragraph affidavit, Mr. Williams describes his difficult upbringing in Fort \\nAlbany First Nation, his experience of abuse at St. Anne’s day school, his alcoholism and \\naddition issues, his cyclical encounters with the criminal justice system, and his move to \\nToronto at age 32. Mr. Williams describes his transition to living on the streets, his \\ndiagnosis with post-traumatic stress disorder, his receipt of Ontario Works benefits, and \\nthe difficulty of living on the streets.  \\n[41] \\nIn paragraphs 28 to 37 of his affidavit, he describes his experiences panhandling, deposing \\nthat he would earn on average $30 to $40 per day, and that he was often ticketed by the \\npolice for violations of the Act and other provincial offences. He describes that, at the time, \\nthe tickets and fines were meaningless to him. He explains that because of his alcoholism, \\n                                                 \\n \\n11 1000425140 Ontario Inc. v. 1000176653 Ontario Inc., 2023 ONSC 6688, at para. 72. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\nhe did not attend his court dates and was convicted. He describes mistreatment by police \\nofficers and how his interactions with the police affected his ability to receive donations. \\n[42] \\nMr. Williams describes that in 2012, he began to take steps to escape the streets and to take \\nbetter care of his health. He states that he has been sober for four years. In 2015, he \\napproached Fair Change and learned that he had amassed over $65,000 in tickets for \\noffences under the Act and other provincial statutes. He describes that in October 2016, he \\nappeared with Fair Change to appeal all his convictions. He and the clinic successfully \\nreplaced the fines with community service and a period of probation. However, he \\nsubsequently learned that due to a spelling error in his first name on some tickets, he owed \\nan additional $16,263 in unpaid fines. He explained that this caused him stress. Mr. \\nWilliams states that he has tried to avoid panhandling but has been forced to obtain \\nexpensive loans from payday lenders. He concludes his affidavit as follows: \\nNone of the progress I made was helped by tickets I was charged \\nwith under the Safe Streets Act. Over the years, these tickets only \\nmade me feel like I was being punished for being poor and made me \\nfeel like even more of an outcast. The fines did nothing to change \\nmy behaviour. If anything, they just made my life less stable. Since \\nleaving the streets, the fines have been nothing but another barrier \\nto recovery at times where I have been most at risk of returning to a \\nlife on the streets. \\nMargaret Bunting’s affidavit \\n[43] \\nIn her 46-paragraph affidavit, Ms. Bunting, describes the challenges in her personal life \\nincluding her experience of domestic violence and how that abuse damaged her mental \\nhealth. She has not been able to work and relies on the Ontario Disability Support Program. \\nIn the late 1990s, her son was hit by a car and suffered a long-term spinal injury. He \\nsubsequently developed a heart infection, lost an eye to that infection, and developed a \\ndependency on opioids. He remains addicted to painkillers and receives ODSP payments. \\n[44] \\nMs. Bunting turned 65 in 2014 and started to receive Canada Pension Plan payments. To \\nsupplement the family’s income, she started to solicit donations. In paragraphs 35 to 43 of \\nher affidavit she describes her experiences soliciting donations. She explains that she \\nsolicits donations near a street corner or, on the weekends, near the drive-through of a \\ncoffee shop. Ms. Bunting states that her daily income from soliciting donations varies \\nsignificantly between $7.00 and $80.00. She states that almost all of her tickets under the \\nAct relate to her solicitation near the coffee shop. She describes her interactions with the \\npolice and the owner of the coffee shop. She explains that with the help of Fair Change, \\nshe fought a charge for breaching probation for missing court dates. She explains that she \\nmisses court dates because “stopping panhandling for even one day puts my son in \\njeopardy.” Ms. Bunting states that she would rather have money in her pocket from \\nsoliciting than worry about what is on her record.  \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nPosition of the parties \\n[45] \\nOntario submits that the affidavits are untested hearsay evidence that is neither necessary \\nnor reliable. In the alternative, Ontario submits that that I should give little or no weight to \\nthe affidavits because the witnesses were not available for cross-examination. \\n[46] \\nFair Change acknowledges that it could not produce either Mr. Williams or Ms. Bunting \\nfor cross-examination. Fair Change filed evidence that, at some point after they swore their \\naffidavits, the affiants fell out of contact with the legal clinic. Fair Change could not find \\nany contact information for Ms. Bunting in its files. Between June and August 2021, \\nvolunteers at the clinic “called various shelters such as Good Shepherd and Fred Victor to \\nsee if the affiants had frequented either location or if the staff knew where they might be. \\nNo one did.” The clinic tried unsuccessfully to contact Mr. Williams in March 2023 at his \\nlast known telephone number. \\n[47] \\nFair Change submits that it is necessary to admit the affidavits because Mr. Williams and \\nMs. Bunting cannot be located and the affidavits meet the test for threshold reliability \\nbecause they were provided under oath. \\nDecision on admissibility \\n[48] \\nEvidence on an application may be given by affidavit unless a statute or the Rules of Civil \\nProcedure provide otherwise.12 Rule 39.02 provides that a party may cross-examine the \\ndeponent of any affidavit served by a party and, thereby, creates a prima facie right to \\ncross-examine upon an affidavit.13 On an application such as this one, the opportunity to \\ncross-examine the deponent takes place out of court and the court receives the transcript \\nfrom the cross-examination. \\n[49] \\nFair Change submits that the affidavits of Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting should be \\nadmitted for the truth of their contents under the principled exception to the hearsay rule.14 \\nFair Change did not rely on any of the traditional common law exceptions to the hearsay \\nrule.  \\n[50] \\nThe essential defining features of hearsay are: \\na. the fact that the statement is adduced to prove the truth of its contents; and  \\nb. the absence of a contemporaneous opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.15 \\n                                                 \\n \\n12 Rule 39.01(1), R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. \\n13 Ontario (Attorney General) v. $17,700.00 in Canadian Currency (In Rem), 2015 ONSC 4301, 126 O.R.

Courts have identified four specific \\nconcerns with hearsay evidence that relate to the declarant’s perception, memory, \\nnarration, and sincerity.16 In Baldree, the Supreme Court of Canada explained these \\nconcerns as follows: \\nFirst, the declarant may have misperceived the facts to which the \\nhearsay statement relates; second, even if correctly perceived, the \\nrelevant facts may have been wrongly remembered; third, the \\ndeclarant may have narrated the relevant facts in an unintentionally \\nmisleading manner; and finally, the declarant may have knowingly \\nmade a false assertion. The opportunity to fully probe these \\npotential sources of error arises only if the declarant is present in \\ncourt and subject to cross-examination.17 \\n[52] \\nUnder the principled exception, hearsay can be admitted into evidence when the party \\ntendering it demonstrates that the evidence meets the twin criteria of necessity and \\nthreshold reliability on a balance of probabilities.18 The court must act as a gatekeeper and \\nonly admit necessary and sufficiently reliable hearsay.19 \\n[53] \\nThe criteria of necessity and reliability should not be assessed in isolation because they \\nwork in tandem. That does not mean, however, that reliability becomes more flexible as \\nnecessity increases. Threshold reliability must be established in every case.20 There must \\nbe circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness or a sufficient substitute basis for testing \\nthe evidence.21 \\nNecessity \\n[54] \\nNecessity is to be given a flexible definition and it is not to be equated with the \\nunavailability of the witness.22 A party seeking to meet the necessity standard must \\ndemonstrate reasonable necessity, not absolute necessity. The party must demonstrate that \\nit is unable to obtain evidence of a similar quality from another source. \\n[55] \\nIn my view, Fair Change has met the necessity standard. There are three contextual factors \\nthat persuade me that it is reasonably necessary to admit the affidavits of Mr. Williams and \\nMs. Bunting.  \\n[56] \\nFirst, it is understandable that it may be more difficult to locate affiants living in \\nimpoverished and unstable circumstances. Ms. Clow explains how Fair Change lost contact \\n                                                 \\n \\n16 Khelawon, at para. 2; R. v. Starr, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, at para. 159. \\n17 Baldree, at para. 32 [emphasis in original]. \\n18 Khelawon, at para. 47.  \\n19 R. v. Bradshaw, 2017 SCC 35, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 865, at para. 24. \\n20 R. v. Furey, 2022 SCC 52, 476 D.L.R. (4th) 193, at para. 4. \\n21 Bradshaw, at para. 31; R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, at pp. 937-938; Khelawon, at para. 105. \\n22 Khelawon, at para. 78. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\nwith Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting after they swore their affidavits. While Fair Change \\ncould have done more to collect and preserve the contact information of the affiants, there \\nis no guarantee that the contact information would still have been accurate at the time of \\nthe cross-examinations. Given the circumstances of the affiants, I think it is appropriate to \\nadopt a flexible approach to necessity. \\n[57] \\nSecond, and in a related point, this litigation was almost seven years old at the time of the \\nhearing. Fair Change issued the notice of application on June 21, 2017. The affidavits at \\nissue were sworn on April 14, and May 1, 2018. The cross-examinations did not take place \\nuntil July and August 2023. It is unclear from the record why so much time passed, and I \\nam not assigning blame. I do think it is a relevant contextual factor as I am assessing the \\nnecessity of the evidence. The likelihood that Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting, given their \\nprecarious living conditions, would not be available for cross-examination increased as \\nmore and more time passed between the signing of the affidavits and the commencement \\nof the cross-examinations. \\n[58] \\nThird, I think it is important that the court have access to this evidence given the importance \\nof the issue to Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting. While Fair Change has also filed affidavit \\nevidence from Donald Dunbar and Ashley Roberts, who were cross-examined by Ontario, \\nI do not think the evidence of Mr. Dunbar and Ms. Roberts are a complete substitute for \\nthe evidence of Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting. Each affiant experienced the restrictions \\nimposed by the Act in their own way. Each affiant has their own story that they wanted to \\nplace before the court as it assesses the constitutionality of the Act. In these circumstances, \\nI am satisfied that the affidavits of Mr. Dunbar and Ms. Roberts do not diminish the \\nnecessity of receiving the affidavits of Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting. \\n[59] \\nIn conclusion, I am satisfied that it is reasonably necessary to admit the affidavits of Mr. \\nWilliams and Ms. Bunting.  \\nThreshold reliability \\n[60] \\nFair Change can meet the threshold reliability requirement in one of two ways. It must \\ndemonstrate: \\na. procedural reliability by showing there are adequate substitutes to test the truth and \\naccuracy of the affidavits; or \\nb. substantive reliability by showing there are circumstantial or evidentiary factors \\nthat guarantee inherent trustworthiness of the affidavits. \\n[61] \\nProcedural reliability is concerned with whether there is a “satisfactory basis to rationally \\nevaluate the statement.”23 The primary procedural guarantee of reliability for these \\naffidavits is that Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting reviewed the written affidavits, took an \\n                                                 \\n \\n23 Bradshaw, at para. 40. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\noath, and swore that the statements contained in the affidavit were true.24 The fact that the \\naffidavits were written down is a procedural guarantee that, at a minimum, the affiants’ \\nstatements were recorded accurately. This provides a more robust procedural guarantee of \\nreliability than an oral statement. The fact that they were under oath provides a further \\nprocedural guarantee not present in an unsworn out of court statement. \\n[62] \\nIt is true that the statements were not videotaped, but that is not a significant concern in \\nthis application as I do not have the benefit of seeing any of the other witnesses testify. All \\nthat is before me are the affidavits and transcripts of cross-examinations. \\n[63] \\nThis case, however, is not like cases where transcripts of evidence from preliminary \\ninquiries are admitted at trial. In those cases, the opportunity for contemporaneous cross-\\nexamination at the preliminary inquiry is a significant procedural guarantee of reliability.25 \\nEqually, cross-examination at trial can provide a significant procedural guarantee of \\nreliability.26 In this case, of course, there has been no cross-examination at all. \\n[64] \\nThe fact that Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting swore to the truth of their written affidavits is \\na sufficient guarantee of procedural reliability to justify meet the test for threshold \\nreliability.  \\nWeight \\n[65] \\nWhile the affidavits meet the test for threshold reliability, I am concerned that the absence \\nof cross-examination will make it more difficult for me to assess factors relevant to ultimate \\nreliability, namely, the affiants’ credibility and reliability, including their perception, \\nmemory, narration, and sincerity.27 Mr. Williams, in particular, admits to having problems \\nwith recollection. \\n[66] \\nConstitutional litigation transcends the interests of the parties to the proceeding. Fair \\nChange asks the court to strike down legislation that was passed almost 25 years ago. A \\nsufficient evidentiary record is essential in constitutional litigation.28  \\n[67] \\nHere, it is unfair to the process to place weight on affidavits in the absence of cross-\\nexamination. This is particularly true for the affiants’ description of their dealings with \\npolice officers, the circumstances under which they received tickets, and their soliciting \\nactivities. I would be more inclined to give weight to their description of their personal \\nhistory and background, including their very challenging lives. These matters, however, do \\n                                                 \\n \\n24 B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740; R v. Hawkins, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043. \\n25 Hawkins, at para. 76. \\n26 R. v.

I do not \\naccept this submission. It is the complete absence of cross-examination that affects the \\nreliability of the affidavits of Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting. Whether the cross-\\nexamination would have been limited or extensive is not the issue. Rather, it is the absence \\nof the opportunity to question the affiants that affects the ultimate reliability of their \\naffidavits.  \\n[69] \\nWhile the affidavits of Mr. Williams and Ms. Bunting are admissible, I decline to give any \\nweight to them. \\nThe survey data appended to the affidavit of Pauline Larsen \\n[70] \\nOntario filed an affidavit from Pauline Larsen, the executive director of the Downtown \\nYonge Business improvement area. In paragraphs 22 to 28 of her affidavit, she describes \\nsurvey data regarding whether or not survey respondents were feeling unsafe in the \\nneighbourhood and, if so, why. The survey was designed by Dr. Doug Thomson of Humber \\nCollege, who analyzed the data. Ms. Larsen attached the survey data from 2022 to her \\naffidavit as an exhibit. \\n[71] \\nOn cross-examination, Ms. Larsen readily conceded that she is not an expert in the design, \\nconduct, or interpretation of surveys and the resulting data. She was not able to answer any \\nquestions about how he designed the survey. \\n[72] \\nI agree with Fair Change that the survey data cannot be admitted through Ms. Larsen. If \\nDr. Thomson filed an affidavit, he could have been meaningfully cross-examined on the \\nsurvey data. I cannot be satisfied on the state of the evidence that the survey results are \\nstatistically significant. I will give no weight to this survey data. \\nExpert evidence \\n[73] \\nThe parties filed eight expert opinions. Fair Change filed opinions from the following five \\nexperts: \\na. Professor William O’Grady, a professor of sociology at the University of Guelph \\nwho teaches mainly in the area of criminology. He states that he has conducted \\nresearch on homelessness in Canada since the 1990s, with a focus on homeless \\nyouth in Toronto. He has examined the interaction between homeless youth and the \\ncriminal justice system, particularly the police. Fair Change asked Prof. O’Grady \\nto answer three questions:  \\ni. What are the origins of the Act?  \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\nii. Why do people panhandle and what is their relationship with the homeless \\npopulation?  \\niii. Does the Act disproportionately affect or harm Indigenous people, people \\nwith mental health issues, and people who are addicted to alcohol or drugs? \\nb. Dr. Sean Kidd, a clinical psychologist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental \\nHealth and a clinical scientist in CAMH’s complex care and recovery program. Dr. \\nKidd states that his career has been focussed on marginality and service \\nenhancement, with a focus on homeless youth and individuals with severe mental \\nillness. Fair Change asked Dr. Kidd to answer the following questions: \\ni. Does the Act disproportionately affect Indigenous people, people with \\nmental health issues, and people who are addicted to alcohol or drugs? If \\nso, can you quantify the approximate extent of the disproportion? \\nii. Do restrictions on panhandling under the Act and penalties for illegal \\npanhandling under the Act affect the physical and psychological health of \\npanhandlers? \\niii. How difficult is it for panhandlers with addictions or mental health issues \\nto challenge the tickets they receive under the Act? \\niv. How difficult is it for panhandlers with addictions or mental health issues \\nto modify their panhandling behaviour in response to tickets? \\nv. How difficult is it for panhandlers with addictions or mental health issues \\nto get off the street and commit to treatment? \\nc. Professor Joseph Hermer, an associate professor of sociology at the University of \\nToronto. Prof. Hermer has researched the social character and meaning of begging \\nin public spaces with specific references to English vagrancy law. Fair Change \\nasked him to provide an opinion on “the extent and effects of the restrictions in the \\n[Act] on what has traditionally been accepted as panhandling.” \\nd. Professor Jonathan L. Freedman, an emeritus professor of psychology. Professor \\nFreedman has studied social psychology, social influence, and social judgment. \\nFair Change retained Prof. Freedman to provide an opinion “commenting on the \\ndefinition of ‘aggressive manner’ given in the Act, as well as how difficult it would \\nbe for police officers or courts to apply that definition.” \\ne. John Stapleton, the principal of Open Policy, a social policy consulting company, \\nwho states that he has expertise in income support benefit design and social policy, \\nin particular with respect to social assistance in Ontario. Fair Change asked him to \\nprovide an opinion on the following topics: \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\ni. What is social assistance in Ontario, including the benefit rates? How have \\nsocial assistance rates changed over approximately the last three decades? \\nii. Is there evidence about how many people who panhandle or who are \\nhomeless, are also in receipt of social assistance or vice versa? Why might \\na person in receipt of social assistance panhandle? \\niii. How easy or difficult is it to change one’s status as a person in receipt of \\nsocial assistance? \\niv. Can you describe the demographic makeup of those who receive social \\nassistance (e.g., based on race, indigeneity, gender, marital/family status, \\ndisability, immigration status, income or a socioeconomic status)? \\nv. What kind of prejudice, stigma, and/or stereotyping do those in receipt of \\nsocial assistance face, from both the state and society? \\nvi. Can social assistance recipients be characterized as historically \\ndisadvantaged and if so, why? \\nvii. Is there any evidence of the extent to which receipt of social assistance may \\nbe intergenerational? \\n[74] \\nIn response, Ontario filed three expert opinions: \\na. Dr. Cheryl Cherpitel, a senior scientist at the National Alcohol Research Center, \\nAlcohol Research Group, Public Health Institute, was tendered as an expert in the \\nepidemiology of alcohol, drug use, and injuries. Ontario asked her to provide her \\nopinion on the following questions: \\ni. Is there a relationship between intoxication and aggression, violence or \\ninjury to self and/or others? Where relevant, please refer to your own \\npublications, your review of the relevant literature, and any other relevant \\nsources, publications or data.  \\nii. Section 2(3)(5) of the [Act] prohibits soliciting while intoxicated by alcohol \\nor drugs. In your view, does this prohibition relate to the goal of reducing \\nthe risk of aggression, violence or injury in public places, and if so, how? \\nb. Professor David Thacher, associate professor of public policy and urban planning \\nat the University of Michigan, was tendered as an expert in criminal justice policy \\nand order maintenance. Ontario asked him to provide his opinion on the following \\nquestions: \\ni. Please explain the concept of \"order maintenance\" and any related terms \\nused in the literature (e.g., \"broken windows\" policing; \"quality of life\" \\npolicing).  \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\nii. What are the goals of order maintenance policing?  \\niii. Does this Act, particularly s. 2 and 3, relate to order maintenance and its \\ngoals?  \\niv. Please review the affidavits relied on by the Applicant in this matter, \\nincluding in particular the affidavits of the four expert witnesses: Jonathan \\nFreedman, Sean Kidd, William O\\'Grady and Joseph Michael Hermer. \\nPlease indicate where you agree and disagree with them and why, with \\nreference to your own areas of expertise and publications, your review of \\nthe relevant literature, and any other relevant sources, publications or data. \\nc. Professor William Sousa, professor of criminology and criminal justice, and \\ndirector of the center for crime and justice policy at the University of Nevada Las \\nVegas, was tendered as an expert in criminal justice policy and order maintenance. \\nOntario asked him to provide his opinion on the following questions: \\ni. Please explain the concept of \"order maintenance\" and any related terms \\nused in the literature (e.g., \"broken windows\" policing; \"quality of life\" \\npolicing).  \\nii. What are the consequences of order not being maintained?  \\niii. Does this Act, particularly s. 2 and 3, relate to order maintenance and its \\ngoals?  \\niv. Please review the affidavits relied on by the Applicant in this matter, \\nincluding in particular the affidavits of the four expert witnesses: Jonathan \\nFreedman, Sean Kidd, William O\\'Grady and Joseph Michael Hermer. \\nPlease indicate where you agree and disagree with them and why, with \\nreference to your own areas of expertise and publications, your review of \\nthe relevant literature, and any other relevant sources, publications or data. \\n[75] \\nProfessor O’Grady filed a reply affidavit responding to the affidavits of Prof. Thacher and \\nProf. Sousa. In this reply affidavit, Prof. O’Grady offered a critical appraisal of the \\ncriminological theory underlying “broken windows policing.”  \\nAdmissibility of expert evidence \\n[76] \\nTo be admissible on an application, an expert opinion must comply with rule 53.03(2.1), \\nwhich requires, among other things, that the expert list every document relied on to provide \\nthe opinion: rule 53(2.1)6(iii). This information is necessary, but not sufficient for an expert \\nreport to be admissible at a hearing.  \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\n[77] \\nExpert opinion evidence is presumptively inadmissible unless it meets the two-stage test \\nfor admissibility set out in White Burgess.29 The first stage focuses on threshold \\nrequirements of admissibility. If the proposed expert evidence does not meet the threshold \\nrequirements, it is excluded. If the proposed evidence meets the threshold requirements, \\nthe evidence must still pass the second stage, which focuses on the judge’s discretionary \\ngatekeeper role. The judge must be satisfied that the benefits of admitting the evidence \\noutweigh the costs of its admission.30 Expert evidence is admissible when: \\n1. \\nThe evidence meets the threshold requirements of \\nadmissibility, which are that the evidence must: \\na. be logically relevant; \\nb. be necessary to assist the trier of fact; \\nc. not be subject to any other exclusionary rule; \\nd. The expert must be properly qualified, which includes the \\nrequirement that the expert be willing and able to fulfil the \\nexpert’s duty to the court to provide evidence that is: \\ni. impartial, \\nii. independent, and \\niii. unbiased. \\ne. For opinions based on novel or contested science or \\nscience used for a novel purpose, the underlying science \\nmust be reliable for that purpose, \\nand \\n2. \\nThe trial judge, in a gatekeeper role, determines that the \\nbenefits of admitting the evidence outweigh its potential risks, \\nconsidering such factors as: \\na. legal relevance \\nb. necessity, \\n                                                 \\n \\n29 White Burgess Langille Inman v.

I accept that all of the expert evidence meets the threshold \\nrequirements of admissibility. \\n[79] \\nNevertheless, it is incumbent on me as judge to act as a gatekeeper and determine whether \\nthe benefits of admitting the evidence outweighs its potential risks.32 It is no longer \\nsufficient to admit all expert evidence without any consideration and later on determine \\nwhat weight to give to that evidence: \\nThe admissibility of the expert evidence should be scrutinized at the \\ntime it is proffered, and not allowed too easy an entry on the basis \\nthat all of the frailties could go at the end of the day to weight rather \\nthan admissibility.33 \\n[80] \\nThe situation is somewhat different for a judge hearing an application. The experts gave \\ntheir opinions only in writing and not through oral evidence in court. The parties and \\ninterveners have delivered factums based on the expert evidence. Nevertheless, I think it is \\nimportant to exercise my role as gatekeeper and assess the benefits and risks of admitting \\nsuch evidence because it will assist me not only to determine admissibility but also the \\nweight that I will give to the evidence.  \\n[81] \\nI have two primary concerns about the expert evidence tendered by Fair Change. First, Fair \\nChange has not clearly delineated the scope of the proposed expert evidence. Second, the \\nexperts have not clearly demonstrated the reliability of their opinions. The other factors at \\nthe gatekeeping stage are not of concern.  \\nScope of the expert evidence \\n[82] \\nEven on an application, the admissibility inquiry is not conducted in a vacuum. As a first \\nstep in determining admissibility, the judge must determine the nature and scope of the \\nproposed expert evidence.34 This establishes the boundaries of the proposed evidence and \\nensures that the expert does not overreach and provide evidence outside the scope of their \\nexpertise: \\n                                                 \\n \\n31 Abbey #2, at para. 48, citing L.

Before \\ndeciding admissibility, a trial judge must determine the nature and \\nscope of the proposed expert evidence. In doing so, the trial judge \\nsets not only the boundaries of the proposed expert evidence but \\nalso, if necessary, the language in which the expert\\'s opinion may be \\nproffered so as to minimize any potential harm to the trial process. \\nA cautious delineation of the scope of the proposed expert evidence \\nand strict adherence to those boundaries, if the evidence is admitted, \\nare essential. The case law demonstrates that overreaching by expert \\nwitnesses is probably the most common fault leading to reversals on \\nappeal.35 \\n[83] \\nIn my view, whether the hearing takes the form of a jury trial, judge alone trial, or an \\napplication, the party tendering the expert should provide a clear, concise, and detailed \\ndescription of the nature and scope of the proposed expert opinion. The judge may then \\naccept, modify, or reject the suggested scope of the expert opinion. Defining the limits of \\nthe expertise of an expert is an essential part of the judge’s gatekeeping role. As the Hon. \\nStephen Goudge observed: \\nThe very act of defining the precise limits of a witness’s expertise \\nwill have the salutary effect of ensuring that the evidence given is \\ntruly expert. Defining the limits of expertise is a key part of the trial \\njudge’s role as gatekeeper.36 \\n[84] \\nA clear and precise description of the proposed nature and scope of expert evidence is of \\nsignificant assistance to the court when it is attempting to define the limits of the scope of \\nthe expert opinion. As the Hon. Mr. Goudge wrote,  \\nA final outcome from the admissibility process is a clear definition \\nof the scope of the expertise that a particular witness is qualified to \\ngive. As discussed in the earlier part of this chapter, it will be \\nbeneficial to define the range of expertise with as much precision as \\npossible so that all the parties and the witness are alerted to areas \\nwhere the witness has not been qualified to give evidence. ... As I \\nearlier recommended, the trial judge should take steps at the outset \\nto define clearly the proposed subject area of the witness\\'s expertise. \\nAt the conclusion of the voir dire, the trial judge will be well situated \\nto rule with precision on what the witness can and cannot say. These \\nsteps will help to ensure that the witness\\'s testimony, when given, \\n                                                 \\n \\n35 Abbey, at para. 62. \\n36 Ontario, Inquiry into Pediatric Forensic Pathology in Ontario, Report: Policy and Recommendations, vol. 3 \\n(Toronto: Queen\\'s Printer, 2008), p. 474 \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\ncan be confined to permissible areas and that it meets the \\nrequirement of threshold reliability.37 \\n[85] \\nFor example, it is not particularly helpful to advise the court that the scope of the expert’s \\nopinion will relate to “financial markets.” Instead, a much more useful description of the \\nscope and nature of the opinion was offered by the Crown in R. v. Colpitts:  \\nThe Crown applied to qualify Mr. Evans as an expert capable of \\ngiving opinion evidence in the following area: \\nMr. Evans will be qualified as an expert to provide opinion \\nevidence related to the analysis and interpretation of stock \\nmarket trading practices and techniques utilized to \\nartificially affect and/or maintain the price of publicly traded \\nshares and, in particular, has conducted an analysis of the \\ntrading practices involving the shares of Knowledge House \\nIncorporated.38 \\n[86] \\nIn this case, I discern that Ontario proposed the following scope for the experts it tendered: \\na. Dr. Cherpitel: the epidemiology of alcohol, drug use, and injuries; \\nb. Prof. Thacher: criminal justice policy and order maintenance; and \\nc. Prof. Sousa: criminal justice policy and order maintenance. \\n[87] \\nI find the scope of expertise offered for Dr. Cherpitel to be the most helpful. I am able to \\nreview her qualifications to determine whether or not she is qualified to give an opinion \\nwith the scope suggested by Ontario. As importantly, I can measure the evidence provided \\nin her affidavit against the suggested scope and determine if her evidence strays beyond \\nthe permissible scope. \\n[88] \\nThe suggested scope of opinion for Prof. Thacher and Prof. Sousa is less helpful to me. \\nThe first half of the scope of the opinion is framed in very broad terms, namely, “criminal \\njustice policy.” To the extent that the scope of the opinion is limited by the phrase “order \\nmaintenance,” that is somewhat helpful for me to understand the scope of the opinion \\nOntario seeks to admit.  \\n[89] \\nFor example, it allows me to consider whether or not Prof. Thacher and Prof. Sousa should \\nbe permitted, as they were asked to do, to indicate where they “agree and disagree” with \\nthe opinion of Dr. Kidd, who is a clinical psychologist. It is not clear to me how Prof. \\n                                                 \\n \\n37 Inquiry into Pediatric Forensic Pathology, vol. 3, pp. 499-500. \\n38 R. v. Colpitts, 2016 NSSC 210, at para 3. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\nThacher or Prof. Sousa could properly comment on an opinion offered by Dr. Kidd \\n(presuming, of course, that Dr. Kidd’s opinion stayed within his expertise).  \\n[90] \\nIt is more difficult to discern the proposed nature and scope for each of Fair Change’s \\nexpert’s opinions. I understand the academic credentials and research interest of each \\nexpert. I understand the topics or questions that Fair Change asked each expert to address. \\nI have more difficulty, however, discerning the scope of the opinion to be offered. In turn, \\nthis makes it more difficult to assess whether or not the evidence offered by each expert \\nstrays outside of the limits of their expertise and the proper scope of the opinion. \\n[91] \\nI will not exclude any of the expert evidence tendered by Fair Change because of my \\nconcerns about the scope of the expert’s evidence. I will, however, be mindful of this issue \\nwhen I consider their evidence. Where I conclude that the expert’s opinion is straying into \\nthe penumbra of their expertise, I will scrutinize that evidence more closely and may give \\nit less weight.  \\nConcerns about the reliability of the evidence \\n[92] \\nAt the gatekeeper stage, the reliability of the proposed evidence is central to its probative \\nvalue and, therefore, to the benefits of admitting it.39 Expert evidence of dubious or \\nquestionable reliability has little probative value, offers little benefit to the legal process, \\nand risks distorting and prejudicing the fact-finding process.40 \\n[93] \\nIn assessing reliability, courts are to take an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of \\nthe reliability of expert evidence. The court is not simply to trust the expert. The court asks \\nthe expert to show and then persuade the court that the expert’s opinion is reliable. Justice \\nLaskin adopted the academic work of Paciocco J.A. and explained that: \\ncourts now take what he called, and what the Goudge Report called, \\nan evidence-based approach to the evaluation of the reliability of \\nexpert evidence. [Prof. David Paciocco] wrote at p. 146: “In effect, \\nthe ‘trust me’ approach, once typical in Canadian courts, has been \\nreplaced by a ‘persuade me’ standard”. And near the end of his \\narticle, at p. 155,…he wrote: “…the essence of an evidence-based \\napproach is that the tribunal be given all of the data it needs to assess \\nthe opinion it is being asked to accept. Anything less and a ‘trust \\nme’ approach is used.”41 \\n[94] \\nFair Change’s experts ask me to trust them. The opinions of Prof. O’Grady, Dr. Kidd, Prof. \\nHermer, and Prof. Freedman contain very few citations to the academic work or studies on \\nwhich they rely. I note that Prof. O’Grady’s reply opinion, which critiqued the \\ncriminological theories relied on by Prof. Thacher and Prof. Sousa contained many more \\n                                                 \\n \\n39 Abbey (#2), at para. 54; Abbey, at para. 87; R v. J.-L.J..; R. v. Trochym, 2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239. \\n40 R. v. Mohan, at p. 21; Abbey (#2), at para. 115.  \\n41 Abbey (#2), at para. 119. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 25 \\n \\n \\ncitations to the academic literature he discussed and attached some of the studies he \\nconsidered. \\n[95] \\nEach expert did attach to their opinion a “list of the documents I relied on in informing my \\nopinion.” While supplying that list complies with rule 53(2.1)6(iii), it does little to help me \\nassess the reliability of the opinion. Moreover, those documents are not attached to their \\nprimary affidavits as exhibits. Finally, given the absence of pinpoint citations, I would have \\nno way of easily checking which document supported which assertion contained in the \\nopinion. \\n[96] \\nThere is no doubt that each of Fair Change’s experts has impressive academic credentials. \\nHowever, none of the experts provided the court with the data necessary to assess the \\nopinion. They are saying, “trust me.” I will provide some examples to illustrate the point.  \\n[97] \\nProf. O’Grady offers the following opinion: \\n20. \\nThere is no doubt that many more Indigenous people are \\nbeing ticketed in more recent years than was the case when the SSA \\nwas first put into place and that Indigenous people are \\ndisproportionately targeted under the SSA. Research indicates that \\nbeing non-white (such as black or Indigenous) is a statistically \\nsignificant predictor of whether a youth will be ticketed when just \\n“walking down the street” or while “hanging around with friends.” \\nThe latter (i.e., hanging around with friends) was found to be a \\nparticularly significant predictor of ticketing of Indigenous youth.  \\n21. \\nResearch also shows that the SSA disproportionately affects \\npeople with mental health/addiction issues. One estimate suggests \\nthat 25-50% of homeless people in Canada have a mental health \\ncondition. Another study reports a number of over 92% in \\nVancouver (numbers are generally higher in the west, due to drug \\naddictions). While the percentage of homeless people with a mental \\nhealth/addiction issue depends on several variables, including the \\ndefinition of “homelessness”, what is clear is that it is much higher \\nthan in the general population, where approximately 8% of adults in \\nCanada who will experience major depression at some time in their \\nlives, and about 1% of Canadians will experience bipolar disorder \\n(or \"manic depression\") in their lifetime. \\n[98] \\nNowhere in Prof. O’Grady’s first affidavit does he specifically identify the studies he is \\nrelying on to support the opinions expressed in paragraphs 20 and 21 of his affidavit. I \\ncannot check that he is even quoting the studies accurately, much less assess the validity \\nof any of the data cited or the inferences that Prof. O’Grady has drawn. Moreover, as I will \\nexplain below, it is not clear to me that the data contained in the reports he listed support \\nhis opinions. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 26 \\n \\n \\n[99] \\nDr. Kidd offered the following opinion: \\n17. \\nIt is highly likely that restrictions on and penalties for \\npanhandling under the SSA affect the physical and psychological \\nhealth of panhandlers. The process of police engagement and \\nsurveillance and being charged in such circumstances is stressful \\nand conducive of further marginalization for most of these \\nindividuals. A punitive response rather than one that involves \\nconnecting the individual with supports would create more stress \\nand marginalization and, accordingly, could readily translate into a \\nworsening of physical and psychological health across the board in \\nthis situation…. \\n[100] Dr. Kidd does not explain if his opinion is informed by his own treatment of patients, his \\nown statistical or clinical research, or other studies. No citations are offered in this \\nparagraph. Dr. Kidd has not showed me his work. He is simply asking me to trust him. \\n[101] Dr. Freedman offered the following opinion: \\n17. \\nThe judgments police officers must make are considerably \\nmore difficult than these, because they are judging not overt \\naggressive acts, but whether an act is done in an “aggressive \\nmanner,” that is, in [“]a manner that is likely to cause a reasonable \\nperson to be concerned for his or her safety or security”. In making \\nsuch judgments, it is inevitable that they will be affected by their \\npersonal beliefs and expectations. If they are inclined to distrust \\nthose who solicit, police officers will be more likely to see their \\nactions as aggressive then if they do not distrust them. If they expect \\nthem to be aggressive, they will be more likely to perceive them as \\naggressive. If they have any prejudices against them, they will be \\nmore likely to perceive them as aggressive. This would be true of \\nanyone making the judgments, and it is extremely unlikely that \\npolice officers will be immune to the effect of their own beliefs and \\nexpectations. In other words, where actions are not either the \\n‘obviously aggressive’ or ‘obviously non aggressive’ extreme, there \\nwill be no consistent standard applied by police officers. \\n[102] Dr. Freedman did not include any citations to the literature that supported of his opinion. \\nIt was only on cross-examination that Dr. Freedman acknowledged that none of the \\ndocuments he relied on to form this opinion discussed police enforcement of soliciting \\nunder the Act or included any empirical or survey evidence about police attitudes towards \\npeople who solicit. In these circumstances, it is very difficult for me to assess the reliability \\nof Dr. Freedman’s opinion or to give it any weight.  \\n[103] As noted above, Prof. O’Grady, Dr. Kidd, Prof. Hermer, and Prof. Freedman did not attach \\nthe documents they reviewed to their affidavits. Ontario exhibited some of these documents \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 27 \\n \\n \\nduring the cross-examination of these witnesses. But for that, I would not have any of the \\nsource material before me. As I will address below, the data contained in the studies \\nundermine some of the opinions offered by the experts.  \\n[104] Ontario did not ask me to exclude the affidavits as unreliable. For that reason, I will not do \\nso. I accept the impressive academic qualifications of the experts tendered by Fair Change, \\nbut I cannot simply trust them. The modern approach to expert evidence, particularly in \\nconstitutional litigation, demands more. The failure to demonstrate the reliability of their \\nopinions causes me to give the opinions significantly less weight than might otherwise be \\nthe case. \\n3. \\nThe scheme of the Act \\n[105] The Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the Safe Streets Act in 1999 and it came into \\nforce on January 31, 2000.42 The Act creates regulatory, not criminal offences. The \\nobjective of regulatory legislation is to protect the public from the potentially adverse \\neffects of otherwise lawful activity. Regulatory legislation is designed to prevent future \\nharm by enforcing minimum standards of conduct. In R. v. Wholesale Travel Group, Cory \\nJ. explained the objective of regulatory legislation this way:  \\nThe objective of regulatory legislation is to protect the public or \\nbroad segments of the public (such as employees, consumers and \\nmotorists, to name but a few) from the potentially adverse effects of \\notherwise lawful activity. Regulatory legislation involves a shift of \\nemphasis from the protection of individual interests and the \\ndeterrence and punishment of acts involving moral fault to the \\nprotection of public and societal interests. While criminal offences \\nare usually designed to condemn and punish past, inherently \\nwrongful conduct, regulatory measures are generally directed to the \\nprevention of future harm through the enforcement of minimum \\nstandards of conduct and care.43 \\n[106] In this application, Fair Change challenges the constitutionality of sections 2, 3, and 5 of \\nthe Act. Fair Change does not challenge the constitutionality of section 4, which relates to \\nthe disposal of certain items in an outdoor public space, or section 6, which provides \\nauthority in certain circumstances for a police officer to arrest a person whom the officer \\nbelieves on reasonable and probable grounds has contravened the Act.44 \\n                                                 \\n \\n42 Safe Streets Act, 1999, S.O. 1999, c. 8. \\n43 [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, at para. 219, \\n44 Section 6 provides that: “A police officer who believes on reasonable and probable grounds that a person has \\ncontravened section 2, 3 or 4 may arrest the person without warrant if, \\n(a) before the alleged contravention of section 2, 3 or 4, the police officer directed the person not to engage \\nin activity that contravenes that section; or \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 28 \\n \\n \\n[107] For the purposes of sections 2 and 3 of the Act, the term “solicit” is defined in broad terms \\nto mean: \\nto request, in person, the immediate provision of money or another \\nthing of value, regardless of whether consideration is offered or \\nprovided in return, using the spoken, written or printed word, a \\ngesture or other means.45 \\nSection 2 prohibits solicitation in an aggressive manner \\n[108] Section 2 of the Act prohibits solicitation in an “aggressive manner,” which is itself a \\ndefined term. Subsections 2(1) and (2) provide as follows: \\n2. (1) In this section, \\n“aggressive manner” means a manner that is likely to cause a \\nreasonable person to be concerned for his or her safety or security.  \\n(2) No person shall solicit in an aggressive manner. \\n[109] Subsection 2(3) of the Act deems six activities to be soliciting in an aggressive manner for \\nthe purposes of section 2. Subsection 2(3) provides that: \\n(3) Without limiting subsection (1) or (2), a person who engages in \\none or more of the following activities shall be deemed to be \\nsoliciting in an aggressive manner for the purpose of this section: \\n1. Threatening the person solicited with physical harm, by \\nword, gesture or other means, during the solicitation or after \\nthe person solicited responds or fails to respond to the \\nsolicitation. \\n2. Obstructing the path of the person solicited during the \\nsolicitation or after the person solicited responds or fails to \\nrespond to the solicitation. \\n3. Using abusive language during the solicitation or after the \\nperson solicited responds or fails to respond to the \\nsolicitation. \\n                                                 \\n \\n(b) the police officer believes on reasonable and probable grounds that it is necessary to arrest the person \\nwithout warrant in order to establish the identity of the person or to prevent the person from continuing or \\nrepeating the contravention.” \\n45 Safe Streets Act, s. 1. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 29 \\n \\n \\n4. Proceeding behind, alongside or ahead of the person \\nsolicited during the solicitation or after the person solicited \\nresponds or fails to respond to the solicitation. \\n5. Soliciting while intoxicated by alcohol or drugs. \\n6. Continuing to solicit a person in a persistent manner after \\nthe person has responded negatively to the solicitation. \\n[110] I pause here to note that Ontario conceded that s. 2(2) of the Act is the only charging \\nprovision that is contained in section 2. This means that if a person solicits while \\nintoxicated by alcohol, they are deemed to be soliciting in an aggressive manner and can \\nbe charged with violating s. 2(2); they will not be charged under paragraph 2(3)5. This also \\nmeans that the Act provides that proof of one fact (soliciting while intoxicated) can \\nsubstitute as proof of an element of the offence (soliciting in an aggressive manner). The \\nLegislature’s decision to structure the Act this way implicates the presumption of \\ninnocence guaranteed by s. 11(d) of the Charter, which I will address below. \\nSection 3 prohibits soliciting persons in certain places \\n[111] Section 3 of the Act prohibits the solicitation of people who are doing certain things in \\ncertain places.46 Subsection 3(2) provides that: \\n3(2) No person shall, \\n(a) solicit a person who is using, waiting to use, or departing \\nfrom an automated teller machine; \\n(b) solicit a person who is using or waiting to use a pay \\ntelephone or a public toilet facility; \\n(c) solicit a person who is waiting at a taxi stand or a public \\ntransit stop; \\n(d) solicit a person who is in or on a public transit vehicle; \\n(e) solicit a person who is in the process of getting in, out of, \\non or off a vehicle or who is in a parking lot; or \\n(f) while on a roadway, solicit a person who is in or on a \\nstopped, standing or parked vehicle. \\n                                                 \\n \\n46 Section 3(1) contains definitions of “public transit vehicle,” “roadway,” and “vehicle.” Those definitions are \\nuncontroversial, and it is not necessary to consider them in these reasons.  \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 30 \\n \\n \\n[112] In its 2007 decision that I will discuss below, the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the \\nconstitutionality of s. 3(2)(f).47 \\n[113] The marginal note to section 3(2) reads “Solicitation of captive audience prohibited.” \\nDespite the evocative convenience of the “captive audience” shorthand, I will not use that \\nphrase in my reasons. Section 70 of the Legislation Act provides that headings and marginal \\nnotes are inserted in an Act for convenience of reference only and do not form part of it.48 \\nTherefore, I cannot rely on the marginal note to interpret the meaning of subsection 3(2).49 \\nMoreover, I think it is important to focus on the text of the provision, rather than different \\nwords used in the heading or marginal note. \\n[114] Subsection 3(3) provides that the prohibitions on soliciting persons in certain places does \\nnot apply to fundraising activities conducted by registered charities on a roadway with a \\nmaximum speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour where such activities are permitted by an \\napplicable municipal by-law. Fair Change does not challenge the constitutionality of \\nsubsection 3(3) but relies on this clause in support of some of its submissions regarding the \\nconstitutionality of section 3(2). There is no evidence in the record before me to explain \\nhow the exemption in s. 3(3) operates, how municipalities determine what conditions to \\nplace on this activity, or even if any municipality has passed an enabling by-law.  \\nSection 5 sets out the applicable penalties for contraventions of the Act \\n[115] Section 5 of the Act provides that anyone who contravenes sections 2 or 3 of the Act \\ncommits an offence and is liable to certain sanctions.  \\n[116] While section 5 provides that a person who contravenes sections 2 or 3 is liable to a fine, \\nthe Act does not create a mandatory minimum fine. Section 5 also provides that, if certain \\nconditions are met, a person convicted of a subsequent offence may be subject to \\nimprisonment for a term of not more than six months. Section 5 provides: \\n5. (1) Every person who contravenes section 2, 3 or 4 is guilty of an \\noffence and is liable, \\n(a) on a first conviction, to a fine of not more than $500; and \\n(b) on each subsequent conviction, to a fine of not more than \\n$1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than six \\nmonths, or to both.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n47 Banks CA. \\n48 Legislation Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c. 21, Sch F, s. 70. \\n49 Mulmer Services Ltd. v.

The administrative and charging framework, \\nhowever, is provided by the Provincial Offences Act.  \\n[118] Fair Change did not challenge the constitutionality of any of the provisions of the \\nProvincial Offences Act. As I will explain below, many of the arguments raised by the Fair \\nChange and the interveners indirectly target the constitutionality or fairness of the \\nprovisions of the Provincial Offences Act. In my view, those arguments are not properly \\nbefore me. I must proceed on the basis that the provisions and processes contained in the \\nProvincial Offences Act are themselves constitutional. Nevertheless, to understand the \\napplicant’s submissions, I think it is helpful to sketch out how alleged violations of the Act \\nare processed through the provisions of the Provincial Offences Act. \\n[119] Parts I and III of the Provincial Offences Act address the issuing of process. \\nPart I – Commencement of proceedings by certificate of offence \\n[120] Part I contains the more streamlined procedure.50 If the police officer chooses to proceed \\nunder Part I, the maximum fine that can be imposed is $1,000, subject to the limits \\ncontained in the Act, and no term of imprisonment can be imposed.51 The officer can \\ninitiate a proceeding either by serving the defendant personally within with a certificate of \\noffence and either an offence notice indicating the set fine for the offence or a summons to \\nappear.52 The certificate must be filed with the court within 7 days.53 \\n[121] If the officer serves an offence notice, the defendant may plead: \\n                                                 \\n \\n50 2682283 Ontario Ltd (Volcano Café and Lounge) v.

If the police officer chooses to \\nproceed under Part III, the maximum allowable fine is $5,000 and imprisonment, subject \\nto the limits contained in the Act. The complainant must swear to the truth of the allegations \\nin the information before a justice.65 If the justice accepts that the complainant has \\nreasonable and probable grounds for believing that the defendant committed an offence, \\nthen the justice will endorse the information.66 The justice must then decide whether to \\nconfirm or issue a summons to appear or whether to issue a warrant for the arrest of the \\ndefendant.67 \\n[127] Part IV of the Provincial Offences Act set out the trial procedure and sentencing procedure \\nfor proceedings commenced under Part I of the Provincial Offences Act.68 \\n[128] The provisions for appeals under both Parts I and III are set out in Part VII of the Provincial \\nOffences Act.69 Where the appeal is from a decision of a justice of the peace, a defendant \\nmay appeal to a provincial judge in the Ontario Court of Justice. Where the appeal is from \\nthe decision of a provincial judge, the appeal lies to the Superior Court of Justice.70  \\nSentencing \\n[129] Where a defendant who appears is convicted of an offence, the court is required to give the \\ndefendant or their representative an opportunity to make submissions as to sentence.71  \\n[130] The maximum penalties in the Act take precedence over the maximum penalties set out in \\nthe Provincial Offences Act.72 No penalty prescribed for an offence is a minimum penalty \\nunless it is specifically declared to be a minimum.73 Even then, the Provincial Offences Act \\ngives the court the discretion to impose a fine that is less than any prescribed minimum or \\nsuspend the sentence where it finds exceptional circumstances that would make imposing \\nthe minimum unduly oppressive or otherwise not in the interest of justice.74 When crafting \\nan appropriate sentence, the court also has the discretion to make inquiries of and \\nconcerning defendant, including as to the defendant’s economic circumstances. \\n[131] A fine that is imposed becomes due and payable 15 days later. Where the court imposes a \\nfine, the court is required to ask if the defendant wishes an extension of time to pay the \\n                                                 \\n \\n65 Provincial Offences Act, s. 23. \\n66 Provincial Offences Act, s. 24. \\n67 Provincial Offences Act, s. 24. \\n68 Provincial Offences Act, ss. 28 to 75. \\n69 Provincial Offences Act, ss. 109 to 142. \\n70 Provincial Offences Act, s. 116. \\n71 Provincial Offences Act s. 57. \\n72 Provincial Offences Act, s. 61, and 59. \\n73 Provincial Offences Act, 59. \\n74 Provincial Offences Act, s. 9.1. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 34 \\n \\n \\nfine, and such a request shall be granted unless the court finds that the request is not made \\nin good faith or that it the extension would be used to avoid payment. Where a fine is \\nimposed in the absence of the defendant, the clerk shall give notice to the defendant both \\nof the fine and the right to apply in writing for an extension of time for payment.75  \\n[132] If a fine is not paid, the clerk of the court may file a certificate, which shall be deemed to \\nbe an order of the court for purposes of civil enforcement.76 The Provincial Offences Act \\npermits the disclosure of a fine that has been outstanding for more than 90 days to a \\nconsumer reporting agency.77 A justice may issue a warrant requiring that a person who \\nhas defaulted on paying a fine be arrested and brought before a justice if other reasonable \\nmethods of colleting the fine have been tried and failed or would not appear to be likely to \\nresult in payment within a reasonable period of time.78 When brought before the court, the \\njustice shall hold a hearing to determine whether the person is unable to pay the fine within \\na reasonable period of time.79  \\n[133] If the justice is satisfied that the person who defaulted is unable to pay the fine within a \\nreasonable period of time, the justice may: \\na. grant an extension of the time allowed for payment of the fine; \\nb. require the person to pay the fine according to a schedule of payments established \\nby the justice; or \\nc. in exceptional circumstances, reduce the amount of the fine or order that the fine \\ndoes not have to be paid.80 \\n[134] If the justice is not satisfied that the person who defaulted is unable to pay the fine within \\na reasonable period of time and that incarceration of the person would not be contrary to \\nthe public interest, the justice may issue a warrant for the person’s committal or may order \\nthat such other steps be taken to enforce the fine as appear to him or her to be appropriate.81 \\nThe term of imprisonment shall be for three days plus one day if the amount paid is not \\ngreater than $50. If the unpaid amount is more than $50, the term of imprisonment shall be \\nfor three days plus approximately one additional day for each $50 that is unpaid.  \\n[135] Where a defendant is convicted of an offence under Part III, the court may suspend sentence \\nand direct the defendant to complete a term of probation with various conditions.82 Breach \\n                                                 \\n \\n75 Provincial Offences Act s. 66(1) to 66.0.1. \\n76 Provincial Offences Act s. 68. \\n77 Provincial Offences Act, s. 69.1. \\n78 Provincial Offences Act, s. 69(6). \\n79 Provincial Offences Act, s. 69(9). \\n80 Provincial Offences Act, s. 69(15). \\n81 Provincial Offences Act, s. 69(14). \\n82 Provincial Offences Act, s. 72. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 35 \\n \\n \\nof probation is itself punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than \\n30 days, or both.83  \\n5. \\nThe prior decisions in R. v. Banks  \\n[136] As I mentioned above, this application is not the first constitutional challenge to the Act. \\nShortly after the Act was proclaimed in force, the case of R. v. Banks moved through three \\nlevels of court in Ontario.84 It will be helpful to briefly describe what the cases did and did \\nnot decide. \\nOntario Court of Justice \\n[137] In early 2000, eight persons were found offering to clean or cleaning windshields with the \\nhope or expectation of receiving money from drivers. The defendants Banks, Barrington, \\nCollins, and Coupal were charged with offences contrary to s. 177(2) of the Highway \\nTraffic Act, as it had been amended by the Act. The defendants Naugle, Moran, Beach, and \\nStevenson were charged with offences under s. 3(2)(f) of the Act.85 In addition, Brydges, \\nBatuskin, Evans, and Leonard were all found approaching stopped vehicles asking for \\nmoney, but without offering to perform a service. They were charged with offences under \\ns. 3(2)(f) of the Act.86 A thirteenth defendant, Hughes, was found soliciting on Bloor Street \\nand following people for a short distance continuing to ask for money after a refusal. \\nHughes was charged with soliciting in an aggressive manner contrary to s. 2(2) of the Act.87 \\n[138] The 13 defendants ranged in age from 16 to 50. All of them, except one, were described as \\nbeing unhoused or having no fixed address. The defendants had a joint trial before Babe J. \\nin the Ontario Court of Justice. Justice Babe released his reasons for decision on August 3, \\n2001.88 \\n[139] The defendants challenged the Act on a number of grounds. First, they made a division of \\npowers argument and asserted that the Act was not within the legislative jurisdiction of the \\nprovince because it was in relation to criminal law, which is a federal head of power. Justice \\nBabe rejected this challenge and characterized the law as legislation in relation to traffic, \\nconduct in the streets, and the regulation of occupations. He held that the law was valid \\nprovincial legislation under the Constitution’s division of powers.89  \\n                                                 \\n \\n83 Provincial Offences Act, s. 75. \\n84 R. v. Banks et al. (2001), 205 D.L.R. (4th) 340 (Ont. C.J.) (“Banks OCJ”), rev’d in part, R. v. Banks (2005), 248 \\nD.L.R. (4th) 118 (Ont. S.C.J.), aff’d Banks CA. \\n85 Banks OCJ, at p. 350 \\n86 Banks OCJ, at p. 351. \\n87 Banks OCJ, at p. 351. \\n88 Banks OCJ. \\n89 Banks OCJ, at pp. 352 to 362. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 36 \\n \\n \\n[140] Second, the defendants asserted that the Act violated sections 2(b), 7, 11(d), and 15 of the \\nCharter.  \\n[141] With respect to the defendants’ s. 2(b) challenge, Babe J. held that the defendants’ activity \\ndid convey or attempt to convey meaning and that the purpose or effect of the government’s \\naction was to restrict expression.90 He concluded that the expression was peripheral to the \\ncore values protected by 2(b) and was more akin to commercial speech than political \\nexpression. He held that the issue before him did “not reach passive panhandlers (noting \\nthat most of the “captive audience” sections are not raised on the facts before me).”  \\n[142] Justice Babe found that the restrictions on the place and manner of soliciting were justified \\nunder s. 1 of the Charter.91 \\n[143] Justice Babe rejected the challenge under s. 7 of the Charter. Justice Babe held that the Act \\nimposed no limitation on the right to life, liberty or security of the person. Therefore, the \\nAct’s prohibitions on approaching cars stopped in traffic and solicitation did not infringe \\nthe defendants’ s. 7 rights. 92 \\n[144] Justice Babe agreed that the Act, as drafted, appeared to violate s. 11(d) of the Charter, \\nwhich guarantees the right of anyone charged with an offence to be presumed innocent \\nuntil proven guilty according to law. Because the Act provided for the possibility of \\nimprisonment, the Charter required that the proof of guilt be beyond a reasonable doubt. \\nJustice Babe noted that in s. 2(3) of the Act, the Legislature had deemed six activities to be \\nsoliciting in an aggressive manner for the purposes of s. 2. Justice Babe held that the section \\nwould be constitutional if the words “in the absence of evidence to the contrary” were read \\ninto s. 2(3). He held as follows: \\nI am of the view, however, that the constitutionality of the section \\ncan be saved by reading into it the words “in the absence of evidence \\nto the contrary”, thereby permitting a defendant to escape conviction \\nif he can raise a reasonable doubt on all the evidence that, in the \\nparticular circumstances, a reasonable person would be so \\nconcerned. I agree with the Crown that the activities described in s. \\n2(3), at least in those paragraphs engaged by the facts concerning \\nthe defendant Hughes, are closely connected to aggressive \\nsolicitation as defined in s. 2(1), so that they raise a reasonable \\ninference that a reasonable person would be apprehensive, an \\ninference that would usually be correct, so that the rational \\nconnection test is met. (It may be questionable that such an inference \\nwould arise strongly from soliciting while intoxicated as provided \\nby para. 5 from that fact alone, but that subparagraph is not engaged \\n                                                 \\n \\n90 Banks OCJ, at p. 377. \\n91 Banks OCJ, at pp. 378 to 379. \\n92 Banks OCJ, at pp. 366 to 368. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 37 \\n \\n \\nby the facts before me.) Since a defendant could no longer be \\nconvicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the \\nelements of the offence, the presumption of innocence would not be \\ninfringed.93 \\n[145] Justice Babe rejected the defendants’ challenge to the Act under s. 15(1) of the Charter. \\nJustice Babe noted that the weight of authority suggested that extreme poverty should not \\nbe seen as an analogous ground under s. 15. He also expressed doubt that the defendants \\nhad made out their claim of discrimination or that the Act itself could be said to have a \\nprejudicial effect on their essential human dignity by placing restrictions on the place and \\nmanner of solicitation.94 \\n[146] Justice Babe noted that all of the defendants had admitted facts that established that each \\nof them had contravened the Act or the Highway Traffic Act. Having upheld the Act as \\nconstitutional (subject to his reading-in of the words “in the absence of evidence to the \\ncontrary), he entered convictions for each of the 13 defendants. \\nSuperior Court of Justice \\n[147] The defendants appealed their convictions to the Superior Court of Justice.95 Justice \\nDambrot heard the appeals over two days and released his reasons for decision on January \\n14, 2005. \\n[148] Justice Dambrot stated that the appellants were challenging the constitutional validity of \\nss. 2, 3, and 7 of the Act.96 \\n[149] The appellants submitted that the Act violated the division of powers between the federal \\nand provincial government. Justice Dambrot held that the pith and substance of the Act fell \\nwithin provincial jurisdiction and that the provisions were not ultra vires the province.97 \\nJustice Dambrot, therefore, dismissed the appeal based on the division of powers. \\n                                                 \\n \\n93 Banks OCJ, at p. 371. \\n94 Banks OCJ, at pp. 371 to 375. \\n95 Although the reasons for decision indicate that 13 defendants appealed their convictions, only five of the \\ndefendants had counsel appear for them on the appeal (Hughes, Beach, Evans, Leonard, and Collins). See Banks \\nSCJ, at para. 4. \\n96 Banks SCJ, at para. 4. At the time, s. 7 of the Act repealed s. 177 of the Highway Traffic Act and substituted the \\nfollowing provision. The only change was to add the words “or approach” to s. 177(2):  \\n177 (1) No person, while on the roadway, shall solicit a ride from the driver of a motor vehicle other than a public \\npassenger conveyance. \\n(2) No person, while on the roadway, shall stop, attempt to stop or approach a motor vehicle for the purpose of \\noffering, selling or providing any commodity or service to the driver or any other person in the motor \\nvehicle. \\n(3) Subsection (2) does not apply to the offer, sale or provision of towing or repair services or any other commodity \\nor service, in an emergency. \\n97 Banks SCJ, at paras. 18 to 35. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 38 \\n \\n \\n[150] Justice Dambrot held that that challenged provisions of the Act were not vague or \\noverbroad in a way that violated s. 7 of the Charter.98 Justice Dambrot deferred to the \\nfinding of Babe J. that the affidavit evidence did not establish that the Act affected the \\nappellants’ “right to survival in any fundamental sense” and agreed that s. 7 of the Charter \\ndid not protect economic rights.99 \\n[151] Justice Dambrot also dismissed the appellants’ submissions regarding s. 15 of the \\nCharter.100 He upheld the findings of Babe J. that the Act imposed no differential treatment \\non the appellants, that extreme poverty was not an analogous ground, and that the Act had \\nno prejudicial effect on their essential human dignity.  \\n[152] The appellants renewed their s. 11(d) Charter challenge to s. 2(3), which deemed six \\nactivities to be soliciting in an aggressive manner for the purposes of the Act. The \\nappellants submitted that Babe J. correctly determined that the section violated s. 11(d) but \\nshould have struck the section down instead of reading in the words “in the absence of \\nevidence to the contrary.” Justice Dambrot held that the manner in which the law violated \\nthe Charter was simple to identify, and that the reading-in remedy granted by Babe J. \\nsolved the constitutional problem precisely. Justice Dambrot upheld the decision of Babe \\nJ. and found that there was no violation of 11(d) after he read those words in to s. 2(3).101 \\n[153] The appellants also renewed their challenge under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Justice Dambrot \\nconducted his own analysis of the alleged infringements. Justice Dambrot described the \\nalleged conduct involving each appellant and concluded that all of the alleged conduct fell \\nwithin the protections of s. 2(b) and concluded that the speech was neither peripheral to the \\ncore value protected by the section nor more akin to commercial speech than to political \\nexpression. Justice Dambrot concluded that the purpose of the Act was to promote public \\nsafety, not to restrict expression and that none of the impugned provisions had the effect \\nof restricting expression within the meaning of s. 2(b).102 \\n[154] Because Dambrot J. found that the Act did not violate the Charter, he did not conduct a \\ncomplete section 1 analysis. Justice Dambrot observed that if there had been a breach, he \\nwould have upheld the violation under s. 1 of the Charter.103 \\n[155] In the result, Dambrot J. dismissed all of the appeals, except for the appeal of Mr. Hughes, \\nwho was convicted of soliciting in an aggressive manner. Although Mr. Hughes admitted \\nto certain acts that were deemed by s. 2(3)4 to amount to soliciting in an aggressive manner, \\nthat took place before Babe J. read the words “in the absence of evidence to the contrary” \\ninto the provision. Justice Dambrot felt that a trier of fact who heard all of the evidence in \\n                                                 \\n \\n98 Banks SCJ, at paras. 36 to 44. \\n99 Banks SCJ, at paras. 45 to 53. \\n100 Banks SCJ, at paras. 54 to 70. \\n101 Banks SCJ, at paras. 71 to 83. \\n102 Banks SCJ, at paras. 84 to 132. \\n103 Banks SCJ, at para. 133. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 39 \\n \\n \\nMr. Hughes’ case may have been left with a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hughes solicited in \\na manner that was likely to cause a reasonable person to be concerned for her or his safety. \\nJustice Dambrot set aside Mr. Hughes’ conviction and, in all of the circumstances, \\nexercised his discretion to enter an acquittal instead of ordering a new trial.104 \\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario \\n[156] Eleven of the defendants appealed the decision of the summary conviction appeal court to \\nthe Court of Appeal for Ontario.105 With reasons for decision authored by Juriansz J.A., \\nthe Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on January 16, 2007. \\n[157] The Court of Appeal emphasized the narrow scope of the appeal. They noted that all 11 of \\nthe appellants had been charged either with soliciting contrary to s. 177(2) of the Highway \\nTraffic Act or soliciting a person on a roadway contrary to s. 3(2)(f) of the Act.106 None of \\nthe appellants before the Court of Appeal were charged under s. 2 of the Act.107  \\n[158] The Court of Appeal rejected the submissions of the interveners and held that the court \\ncould not determine the constitutionality of any provisions except for the provisions under \\nwhich the appellants were charged.108 Therefore, the court held that the appellants were \\nlimited to challenging the constitutionality of s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and s. 177(2) of the \\nHighway Traffic Act and declared that there was no appeal concerning the constitutionality \\nof s. 2, or 3(2)(a) to (e) of the Act before the court.109 The court commented that neither \\nBabe J. nor Dambrot J. should have commented on the constitutionality of any part of s. 3 \\nof the Act, except s. 3(2)(f): \\nI conclude that the scope of this appeal is limited to s. (3)(2)(f) of \\nthe Act and to s. 177(2) of the Highway Traffic Act. While the \\nconstitutionality of s. 2(2) was at issue in Hughes\\' trial and before \\nthe summary conviction appeal judge, it is not an issue on appeal \\nbefore this court. The trial judge noted that the \"captive audience\" \\nprovisions of s. 3(2), except soliciting a person in a stopped vehicle \\nunder para. (f), were not engaged by the facts before him. In my \\nview, neither the trial judge nor the summary conviction appeal \\njudge ought to have commented upon the constitutionality of the \\ncaptive audience provisions of the Act other than s. 3(2)(f) of the \\nAct and s. 177(2) of the Highway Traffic Act.110 \\n                                                 \\n \\n104 Banks SCJ, at paras. 134 to 135. \\n105 Banks, Barrington, Collins, Batuszkin, Beach, Brydges, Evans, Leonard, Moran, Naugle and Stevenson. \\n106 Banks CA, at paras. 2 and 3. \\n107 Banks CA, at para. 17. \\n108 Banks CA, at para. 9. \\n109 Banks CA, at paras. 15 and 22. \\n110Banks CA, at para. 26. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 40 \\n \\n \\n[159] I will keep the Court of Appeal’s caution in mind when I consider the decisions of Babe J \\nand Dambrot J. in these reasons. \\n[160] The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants’ appeal from the summary conviction appeal \\ncourt’s decision that the Act was within the jurisdiction of the province. The Court of \\nAppeal held that the Act was not criminal law and that the pith and substance of s. 3(2)(f) \\nof the Act and s. 177(2) of the Highway Traffic Act was the regulation of the interaction of \\npedestrians and vehicles on the roadways in the interests of public safety, efficient \\ncirculation, and public enjoyment of public thoroughfares.111 \\n[161] The court held that the appellants’ right to liberty under s. 7 of the Charter was engaged \\nbecause they faced potential imprisonment for the conduct for which they were \\nconvicted.112 The court found that the restriction on liberty was in accordance with the \\nprinciples of fundamental justice and that that s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and s. 177(2) of the \\nHighway Traffic Act were neither overbroad nor vague. \\n[162] The Court of Appeal also held that s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and s. 177(2) of the Highway Traffic \\nAct did not violate the right to equality under s. 15 of the Charter.113 The court rejected the \\nappellants’ submission that the provisions were enforced selectively against “beggars” and \\nnot against others who perform similar activities. The court found that the submission \\nfailed as a matter of fact and because the submission conflated discrimination in the \\nadministration of legislation with the discriminatory effects of legislation.114 The court also \\nrejected the submission that the substantive effect of the enforcement of the provisions is \\ndifferent for the appellants than for others based on the trial judge’s finding that the Act, \\nconsidered as a whole, did not affect the appellants’ economic right to survival in any \\nfundamental sense.115 The Court of Appeal also found that the appellants’ proposed ground \\n(those poor enough to need to beg) was not analogous to the enumerated grounds in s. \\n15.116 Finally, and in any event, the court held that the appellants did not establish that the \\nprovisions at issue demeaned their dignity in a manner that would constitute \\ndiscrimination: \\nAssuming these provisions fail to take into account the appellants\\' \\nconditions of economic disadvantage, the provisions do not infringe \\ntheir human dignity by prohibiting them from stepping onto a \\nroadway or approaching a vehicle to solicit.117 \\n                                                 \\n \\n111 Banks CA, at paras. 28 to 72. \\n112 Banks CA, at para. 83. \\n113 Banks CA, at paras. 89 to 107. \\n114 Banks CA, at paras. 92 to 96. \\n115 Banks CA, at para. 97. \\n116 Banks CA, at paras. 98 to 102. \\n117 Banks CA, para. 106. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 41 \\n \\n \\n[163] The Court of Appeal then considered the appellants’ argument that s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and \\ns. 177(2) of the Highway Traffic Act limited the right to freedom of expression found in s. \\n2(b) of the Charter.118 The court held that the appellants’ activity (soliciting) had \\nexpressive content that was not removed by the method or location of the expression, and \\nthe Act had the incidental purpose of restricting soliciting.119 Therefore, the court held, the \\nchallenged provisions infringed s. 2(b) of the Charter.  \\n[164] The Court of Appeal held, however, that the infringement was justified under s. 1 because: \\na. the objective of regulating the interaction of pedestrians and vehicles on roadways \\nwas a pressing and substantial objective; \\nb. prohibiting persons from soliciting or approaching a vehicle while \"on a roadway\" \\nis rationally connected to the legislative objective; \\nc. the provision impaired the appellants’ right of expression as little as possible; and \\nd. the Act’s deleterious effects do not outweigh its benefits.120 \\n[165] The court concluded that the appellants failed to establish that s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and s. \\n177(2) of the Highway Traffic Act were criminal law, or that their rights under ss. 7, 15 or \\n2(b) of the Charter were unjustifiably infringed. The appeal was dismissed in its entirety \\nand the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the application for leave to appeal.121 \\n[166] I will now turn to Fair Change’s constitutional challenge to the Act.  \\n6. \\nSection 11(d) – the presumption of innocence \\n[167] Fair Change brings both a narrow and a broad challenge to ss. 2, 3, and 5 of the Act under \\ns. 11(d). The narrow challenge focuses on the deeming provisions contained in s. 2(3) of \\nthe Act. Fair Change also mounts a broader challenge to the entire “procedural scheme of \\nthe Act.” I will address each in turn. \\n[168] Section 11(d) of the Charter establishes the right of any person charged with an offence to \\nbe presumed innocent until proven guilty: \\n11 Any person charged with an offence has the right… \\n                                                 \\n \\n118 Banks CA, at para. 127. \\n119 Banks CA, at paras. 108 to 126. \\n120 Banks CA, at paras. 129 to 132. \\n121 R. v.

The overarching principle of the presumption of innocence and the correlative \\nprinciple of the Crown’s burden of proof must aways govern the fact-finding process.123 \\nThe narrow challenge to the deeming provisions in subsection 2(3)  \\n[170] Subsection 2(2) of the Act states that no person shall solicit in an “aggressive manner”, \\nwhich is defined in subsection 2(1) to mean “a manner that is likely to cause a reasonable \\nperson to be concerned for his or her safety or security.” \\n[171] Fair Change challenges the constitutionality of subsection 2(3), which contains six \\nparagraphs that deem certain activities to be soliciting in an aggressive manner for the \\npurposes of the Act. Subsection 2(3) of the Act provides as follows: \\n2(3) \\nWithout limiting subsection (1) or (2), a person who engages \\nin one or more of the following activities shall be deemed to be \\nsoliciting in an aggressive manner for the purpose of this section: \\n1. Threatening the person solicited with physical harm, by \\nword, gesture or other means, during the solicitation or after \\nthe person solicited responds or fails to respond to the \\nsolicitation. \\n2. Obstructing the path of the person solicited during the \\nsolicitation or after the person solicited responds or fails to \\nrespond to the solicitation. \\n3. Using abusive language during the solicitation or after the \\nperson solicited responds or fails to respond to the \\nsolicitation. \\n4. Proceeding behind, alongside or ahead of the person \\nsolicited during the solicitation or after the person solicited \\nresponds or fails to respond to the solicitation. \\n                                                 \\n \\n122 R. v.

Continuing to solicit a person in a persistent manner after \\nthe person has responded negatively to the solicitation. \\n[172] Subsection 2(3) provides that proof of a basic fact, the activities described in paragraphs \\n2(3)1 to 6, is deemed to be proof of an essential element of the offence the charging s. 2(2), \\nsoliciting in an aggressive manner. For example, pursuant to paragraph 2(3)5, proof that a \\nperson was soliciting while intoxicated by drugs is deemed to be proof that a person was \\nsoliciting in a manner that is likely to cause a reasonable person to be concerned for their \\nsafety or security. Such provisions have long attracted close scrutiny under s. 11(d) of the \\nCharter to ensure that they do not allow for a person to be convicted despite the existence \\nof a reasonable doubt.124 \\n[173] A provision that establishes a presumption whereby proof of the basic or substituted fact \\n(intoxication) is deemed to be proof of the essential element of an offence (soliciting in an \\naggressive manner) will comply with s. 11(d) of the Charter, if and only if proof of the \\nsubstituted fact leads inexorably to the existence of the essential element that it replaces.125 \\nThis is necessarily a very stringent test. Otherwise, a provision would permit the conviction \\nof an accused without proof of all of the essential elements of an offence beyond a \\nreasonable doubt. The Supreme Court of Canada has emphasized that an inexorable link is \\none that necessarily holds true in all cases: \\nTo be clear, the nexus requirement for demonstrating that a statutory \\npresumption does not offend the presumption of innocence is strict. \\nIt is not one of mere “likelihood” or “probability”, nor is it one \\nsatisfied by a “common sense” or “rational” inference. Rather, this \\nCourt’s jurisprudence demonstrates that the connection between \\nproof of the substituted fact and the existence of the essential \\nelement it replaces must be nothing less than “inexorable”. An \\n“inexorable” link is one that necessarily holds true in all cases.126 \\n[174] To return to my example, is it necessarily true in all cases that a person who solicits while \\nintoxicated by drugs is soliciting in a manner that is likely to cause a reasonable person to \\nbe concerned for their safety or security? No. I do not accept that a reasonable person would \\nfear for their safety and security if they walked past a person who was sitting cross-legged \\non the ground, intoxicated by marijuana, smiling blissfully, and holding a sign that said, \\n“Please spare some change so that my baby and I can get something to eat.” \\n                                                 \\n \\n124 R. v.

Instead, Ontario submits that I should affirm the \\ndecision of Babe J. (affirmed by Dambrot J.) to read the words “in the absence of proof to \\nthe contrary” into s. 2(3), as follows: \\nWithout limiting subsection (1) or (2), a person who engages in one \\nor more of the following activities shall be deemed to be, in the \\nabsence of evidence to the contrary, soliciting in an aggressive \\nmanner for the purpose of this section: … \\n[176] Ontario submits that this is sufficient to solve the 11(d) problem and urges me to adopt this \\nportion of Justice Babe’s reasons: \\nI am of the view, however, that the constitutionality of the section \\ncan be saved by reading into it the words “in the absence of evidence \\nto the contrary”, thereby permitting a defendant to escape conviction \\nif he can raise a reasonable doubt on all the evidence that, in the \\nparticular circumstances, a reasonable person would be so \\nconcerned.127 \\n[177] I do not accept Ontario’s submission. In my view, the 2019 decision of the Supreme Court \\nof Canada in Morrison demonstrates that reading in the words “in the absence of proof to \\nthe contrary” is insufficient to make the deeming provisions in s. 2(3) of the Act \\nconstitutional. \\n[178] Morrison concerned the constitutionality of s. 172.1 of the Criminal Code, which \\nprohibited child luring through telecommunications. Mr. Morrison was charged with child \\nluring under s. 172.1(1)(b) of the Criminal Code — the relevant secondary offence being \\ninvitation to sexual touching directed at a person under the age of 16 contrary to s. 152 of \\nthe Criminal Code. He brought a constitutional challenge to subsection 173.1(3), which \\ncontained the presumption regarding the accused’s belief in the other person’s age for the \\npurpose of the prohibition against child luring: \\n172.1 (1) Every person commits an offence who, by a means of \\ntelecommunication, communicates with  \\n(b) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under \\nthe age of 16 years, for the purpose of facilitating the \\ncommission of an offence under [certain designated offences \\nagainst the person] … \\n(3) Evidence that the person referred to in paragraph (1)(a)…was \\nrepresented to the accused as being under the age of…sixteen \\nyears…is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the \\n                                                 \\n \\n127 Banks OCJ, at para. 371. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 45 \\n \\n \\naccused believed that the person was under that age. [emphasis \\nadded].128 \\n[179] The trial judge agreed that the presumption under s. 172.3(3) violated the presumption of \\ninnocence under s. 11(d) of the Charter.129 The Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the \\ndecision of the trial judge.130  \\n[180] The Crown appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the \\npresumption under s. 172.1(3) did not infringe s. 11(d) because the presumption was \\nrebuttable where there is evidence to the contrary. The Supreme Court rejected the Crown’s \\nsubmission. The Court held that an accused’s opportunity to raise or identify evidence to \\nthe contrary did not resolve the s. 11(d) violation created when proof of the basic fact did \\nnot lead inexorably to the acceptance of the presumed fact: \\nThe Crown maintains that the presumption under s. 172.1(3) does \\nnot infringe s. 11(d) because the presumption is rebuttable where \\nthere is evidence to the contrary. With respect, I cannot agree. A \\nbasic fact presumption will infringe s. 11(d) if proof of the basic fact \\nis not capable, in itself, of satisfying the trier of fact beyond a \\nreasonable doubt of the presumed fact. (This is another way of \\narticulating the “inexorable connection” test). The accused’s \\nopportunity to raise or identify evidence to the contrary does not \\nresolve or attenuate the s. 11(d) problem created when proof of a \\nbasic fact does not lead inexorably to acceptance of the presumed \\nfact. This is because the presumption of innocence requires that the \\nCrown “establi[sh] the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable \\ndoubt before the accused must respond”.131 \\n[181] Morrison teaches that merely reading the words “in the absence of evidence to contrary” \\ninto s. 2(3) of the Act does not resolve or attenuate the s. 11(d) problem if proof of a basic \\nfact in paragraphs 1 to 6 of s. 2(3) does not lead inexorably to acceptance of the presumed \\nfact: that the person was soliciting in an aggressive manner, contrary to subsection 2(2). \\n[182] I find that proving that a person engaged in the activities listed in paragraphs 2(3)2 to 6 \\ndoes not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the person was soliciting in a manner that \\nis likely to cause a reasonable person to be concerned for his or her safety or security. For \\nease of reference, I repeat those provisions here:  \\n                                                 \\n \\n128 Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Obstructing the path of the person solicited during the \\nsolicitation or after the person solicited responds or fails to \\nrespond to the solicitation. \\n3. Using abusive language during the solicitation or after the \\nperson solicited responds or fails to respond to the solicitation. \\n4. Proceeding behind, alongside or ahead of the person \\nsolicited during the solicitation or after the person solicited \\nresponds or fails to respond to the solicitation. \\n5. Soliciting while intoxicated by alcohol or drugs. \\n6. Continuing to solicit a person in a persistent manner after \\nthe person has responded negatively to the solicitation. \\n[183] To be sure, a trier of fact could infer from the evidence before her that the accused who \\nengaged in one of the activities listed in paragraphs 2(3)2 to 6 was soliciting in an \\naggressive manner. That, however, is not the test. The test is whether the connection \\nbetween the activities listed in paragraphs 2(3)2 to 6 and the offence in subsection 2(2) is \\ninexorable. It must necessarily hold true in every case. I find that paragraphs 2(3)2 to 6 do \\nnot meet that test. Even where an accused engaged in the activities described in those \\nparagraphs, a trier of fact could be left with a reasonable doubt about as to whether or not \\nthe accused had solicited in manner that was likely to cause a reasonable person to be \\nconcerned for his or her safety or security. Using the respective paragraph numbers from \\nthe Act, here are just a few examples: \\n2. A person in a wheelchair could momentarily obstruct the path of the person they \\nsolicited on a busy sidewalk. \\n3. A person could use abusive language about their former employer whom they \\nblame for their situation during a solicitation. \\n4. A person could solicit a pedestrian and follow them for a short distance after the \\nsolicitation. (Indeed, Dambrot J. held in Banks that “it was entirely possible” that \\non these facts a trier of fact could be left with a reasonable doubt about whether Mr. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 47 \\n \\n \\nHughes solicited in a manner that was likely to cause a reasonable person to be \\nconcerned for their safety or security).132 \\n5. A person sitting cross-legged on the ground, intoxicated by marijuana, smiling \\nblissfully, and holding a sign that said, “Please spare some change so that my baby \\nand I can get something to eat.” \\n6. A person holding a sign asking for spare change who bursts in to tears after a \\nperson walks by and says “Please, don’t just walk past me, please help me.” \\n[184] I find that proof of the facts in paragraphs 2(3) 2 to 6 do not lead inexorably to proof that \\nthe person was soliciting in an aggressive manner.  \\n[185] I reach a different conclusion about paragraph 2(3)1. For ease of reference, paragraph 2(3)1 \\nprovides as follows: \\nWithout limiting subsection (1) or (2), a person who engages in one \\nor more of the following activities shall be deemed to be soliciting \\nin an aggressive manner for the purpose of this section: \\n1. Threatening the person solicited with physical harm, by \\nword, gesture or other means, during the solicitation or after \\nthe person solicited responds or fails to respond to the \\nsolicitation. \\n[186] If a person soliciting money threatens the person solicited with physical harm, that \\ninexorably leads to the conclusion that the person is soliciting in a manner that is likely to \\ncause a reasonable person to be concerned for his or her safety or security. It is helpful to \\nrecall that the Criminal Code defines an assault to include threatening acts or gestures. \\nSection 265(1)(b) states: \\n265 (1) A person commits an assault when \\n(b) he attempts or threatens, by an act or a gesture, to apply force to \\nanother person, if he has, or causes that other person to believe on \\nreasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect his \\npurpose;133  \\n[187] A person who threatens to cause physical harm to another, by word, gesture or other means \\nduring a solicitation is engaged in profoundly anti-social behaviour. While it is possible \\nthat a person of made of unusually stern stuff may not subjectively be concerned for their \\nsafety if they are threatened with physical harm, that is not the statutory test.

Similarly, not every utterance, statement, or gesture will \\namount to a threat of bodily harm. However, I have no doubt that threats of physical harm \\nwould inexorably lead a reasonable person to fear for their safety and security. \\n[188] Therefore, I find paragraphs 2(3)2 to 2(3)6 limit s. 11(d) of the Charter but paragraph 2(3)1 \\ndoes not. A finding that the Act limits s. 11(d) necessarily means that the Act also limits \\nthe rights under s. 7.134 \\n[189] I will address whether or not this limitation can be justified under s. 1 of the Charter after \\nI consider Fair Change’s broader challenge to the Act. \\nThe broad challenge to ss. 2 and 5 of the Act \\n[190] Fair Change also mounts a much broader challenge to the Act’s “procedural scheme,” \\nwhich it submits “systemically deprives accused panhandlers of their presumption of \\ninnocence.” Fair Change frames its submission in these terms: \\n85. \\nSecond, the [Act’s] procedural scheme systemically \\ndeprives accused panhandlers of their presumption of innocence. As \\nthe concurring evidence of panhandlers, Ms. Nefs and police \\nofficers demonstrate, there is no assurance that individuals who \\npanhandle, many of whom have no fixed address, will receive \\nnotices of their trial dates and locations. The prevalence of mental \\nillness and addiction in the panhandling population further reduces \\nthe chance that they will remember getting ticketed or show up for \\ntheir trial. The pervasiveness of these systemic problem has \\nmanifested in the statistic that less than 1% of those charged with \\n[Act] tickets stand trial. This is the antithesis of \"proof beyond a \\nreasonable doubt\": once a police officer lays a charge, it is virtually \\ncertain that a panhandler will be convicted in absentia. \\n[191] I do not accept Fair Change’s submissions and I dismiss its broad challenge to the Act \\nunder s. 11(d). \\n[192] The Act does not contain a “procedural scheme.” As set out in paragraphs [105] to [116], \\nthe Act creates the substantive regulatory offences and establishes the range of sanctions \\nthat can be imposed upon conviction. The administrative and charging framework, \\ndescribed, indeed the entire “procedural scheme” of the Act, is contained in the Provincial \\nOffences Act, as described in paragraphs [117] to [135], above. \\n[193] Fair Change’s notice of application neither alleges that any provision of the Provincial \\nOffences Act is contrary to the any of the guarantees in the Charter, nor seeks any \\ndeclaratory relief under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act in respect of the Provincial \\n                                                 \\n \\n134 R. v.

It defines the issues, parties, remedies sought, and material facts or \\ngrounds supporting the application. The notice of application must be pleaded with \\nsufficient particularity that the respondent can identify and respond to the essential \\nelements of the constitutional claim, including the specific law that is challenged.135 \\n[194]  If Fair Change wished to challenge the procedural scheme for the administration, \\nprosecution, and trial of offences under the Act, it needed to do so on proper notice to \\nOntario. For this reason, I also do not give effect to Justice for Children and Youth’s \\nsubmissions that the Act violates the Charter because it does not provide for enhanced \\nprocedural protections for those 12 to 18 years of age, such as those found in the Youth \\nCriminal Justice Act.136 Any such challenge must target the Provincial Offences Act, not \\nthe Act.  \\n[195] I dismiss this portion of the application. \\nSection 1 \\n[196] Where a person’s Charter right has been limited by legislation, the government may seek \\nto justify the limit under s. 1 of the Charter, which provides: \\n1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the \\nrights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable \\nlimits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free \\nand democratic society. \\n[197] The government bears the onus of establishing on a balance of probabilities that the law is \\na reasonable limit on the right. A law that limits a Charter right will only be justified if it \\nmeets the proportionality test first articulated in Oakes.137 Ontario must establish that the \\nimpugned provisions have a sufficiently important objective and that the means chosen are \\nproportional to that objective.138 A law is proportionate if: \\n1. there is a rational connection between the means adopted and the \\nobjective; \\n2. it is minimally impairing in that there are no alternative means that \\nmay achieve the same objective with a lesser degree of rights \\nlimitation; and  \\n                                                 \\n \\n135 Andrew K.

For the \\nreasons set out above, I do not accept that submission. In my view, the Act’s infringement \\nof s. 11(d) cannot be justified under s. 1 of the Charter. \\n[199] I accept that the legislature had a pressing and substantial objective in enacting paragraphs \\n2(3)2 to 2(3)6, and that the provisions are rationally connected to their objective.  \\n[200] I find, however, that the deeming provisions fail the minimal impairment test. To show \\nminimal impairment, Ontario must demonstrate that the impugned measure impairs the \\nright in question as little as reasonably possible in order to achieve the legislative \\nobjective.140 The impairment must be minimal in the sense that it impairs the right in \\nquestion no more than necessary.141 \\n[201] Ontario did not establish that absent the deeming provision, s. 2(2) of the Act will not \\noperate effectively to achieve the purpose of the Act. Prosecutors may still ask the trial \\njudge to infer from the evidence that the conduct of the person engaged in soliciting was \\nunlawful because the person solicited in an aggressive manner. \\n[202] Ontario’s expert in the epidemiology of alcohol, drug use and injuries, Dr. Cherpitel, \\nopined that a “strong relationship has been found between alcohol consumption and risk of \\ninjury from all causes” including “a strong association” between alcohol use and injuries \\nresulting from violence. Even if I accept her opinion that paragraph 2(3)5 “clearly relates \\nto the goal of reducing the risk of aggression, violence and injury in public places,” that is \\nnot a sufficient justification for infringing the presumption of innocence. There are many \\nways to advance this goal with far less impairment of the right.  \\n[203] Doing away with the deeming provisions in paragraphs 2(3)2 to 2(3)6 and requiring the \\nCrown to prove a breach of s. 2(2) on the evidence presented is a less intrusive way for \\nOntario to achieve its objective. As the Supreme Court held in Morrison: \\nPut simply, a less intrusive means of achieving the state’s \\noverarching objective would be to do away with the presumption \\nunder s. 172.1(3) and instead rely on the prosecution’s ability to \\nsecure convictions by inviting the trier of fact to find, based on a \\nlogical, common sense inference drawn from the evidence, that the \\naccused believed the other person was underage.

To the extent that the deeming provisions would result in \\nadditional convictions that would not otherwise be obtained under s. 2(2), the only \\nadditional people convicted would be those about whom a reasonable doubt might remain. \\nThe expediency of that result cannot justify creating a risk of convicting the innocent.  \\n7. \\nSection 2(b) – freedom of expression \\n[206] In this application, Fair Change seeks “declarations that all of ss. 2, 3, and 5 of the [Act] \\nviolate s. 2(b) of the Charter” and that the limitation on the right is not justified under s. 1 \\nof the Charter.  \\n[207] In Banks, the Court of Appeal for Ontario has already found that s. 3(2)(f), the prohibition \\non squeegeeing, violates s. 2(b) but that this violation is justifiable under s. 1 of the Charter. \\nI am bound to follow this decision on the basis of vertical stare decisis, which is the \\nprinciple that courts are bound to follow precedent set by higher judicial authority.144 There \\nis nothing in the record that satisfies me that it would be necessary or appropriate to revisit \\nthe decision of the Court of Appeal. \\n[208] Although the Court of Appeal did not consider the amendment to the Act that provides that \\ns. 3(2) of the Act does not apply to fundraising activities of charitable organizations that \\nare permitted by municipal by-law, that does not affect my consideration of the Act.145 As \\nmentioned above, Fair Change provided no evidence to me regarding how the exemption \\noperates including whether or not any municipalities have authorized such solicitation.  \\n[209] Therefore, I find that I am bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Banks and I \\ndismiss Fair Change’s challenge under s. 2(b) of the Charter to s. 3(2)(f) of the Act. \\n[210] Section 2(b) of the Charter provides that everyone has the freedom of thought, belief, \\nopinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media communication. \\nThe constitutional protection for freedom of expression enables democratic discourse, \\nfacilitates truth seeking, and contributes to personal fulfilment.146 Unlike other Charter \\n                                                 \\n \\n142 Morrison, at para. 70. \\n143 RJR-McDonald, at para. 160; Morrison, at para. 71. \\n144 R. v.

Freedom of expression must always be considered in the context presented \\nby each case.148 The relative value of freedom of expression in the context in which it is \\npresented affects the balancing that takes place under s. 1 of the Charter. For this reason, \\ndespite Ontario’s concession, it is worthwhile to work through how the Act infringes s. \\n2(b) before considering whether or not the conceded limitations on the right are justified \\nunder s. 1 of the Charter.  \\n[212] There is a three-part test to determine whether a law infringes s. 2(b) of the Charter: \\n1. Did the activity have expressive content, thereby bringing it within the s. 2(b) \\nprotection? \\n2. Does the method or location of the expression remove that protection? \\n3. If the expression is protected by s. 2(b), does the law infringe that protection, either \\nin purpose or effect?149 \\n[213] First, I find that the activity of solicitation has expressive content. In Banks, the Court of \\nAppeal held that the solicitation limited by the Act was fundamental communication at the \\nvery core of the speech protected by s. 2(b): \\nThe act of begging is communication and is evidently expression. \\nWhile I think the trial judge was correct in rejecting the argument \\nthat begging, without more, is a form of political speech, I would \\nnevertheless characterize it as fundamental communication at the \\ncore of free speech. The message “I am in need and I am requesting \\nyour help” is primary communication that seeks and invites \\nparticipation in the community.150 \\n[214] I accept the evidence of Prof. Hermer that solicitation is a “highly social and \\ncommunicative activity.” The person asking for assistance makes themselves extremely \\nvulnerable by revealing to strangers their immediate need of assistance. The solicitation, \\nthe personal appeal for help, is a profound and important form of social interaction.  \\n[215] This form of solicitation is a form of expression that has historically been used by the poor. \\nTo request aid directly from members of the community is a longstanding and traditional \\n                                                 \\n \\n147 Edmonton Journal v.

It is inexpensive and it may be the only form of expression \\navailable to many individuals in order to influence the giving behaviour of those in more \\nfortunate circumstances. I accept the evidence of Prof. Hermer that this form of solicitation \\nfulfils significant social and psychological needs.  \\n[216] Second, with one exception, the method or location of the expression limited by the Act \\ndoes not remove the protection afforded by s. 2(b). Although the language of s. 2(b) is \\nunqualified and has been given broad interpretation by the courts, there are several internal \\nlimits to the right including location and method of the expressive activity. \\n[217] In my view, the location of the expressive activity at issue (sidewalks, transit vehicles, \\nparking lots) does not remove the protection of s. 2(b). In Banks, the Court of Appeal held \\nthat even though the activity at issue in that case involved solicitation on the traveled \\nportion of a roadway, and even though it may have endangered traffic safety and impeded \\nefficient circulation, the expression did not undermine the purposes of s. 2(b) is intended \\nto serve and did not lose the protections afforded by the section.151 I see no basis to \\ndistinguish the provisions before me from s. 3(2)(f), which the Court of Appeal was \\ndescribing. Streets and sidewalks serve as venues of public communication where society \\nhas long tolerated expression of many varieties.152 If anything, the Court of Appeal’s \\nholding would apply with greater force to the locations at issue on this application, which \\ndo not raise the safety issues posed by people entering traffic. Sidewalks are a place where \\nfree expression not only has traditionally occurred but can be expected to occur in a free \\nand democratic society. \\n[218] However, I find that the method of expression prohibited by paragraph 2(3)1 is excluded \\nfrom the protections of s. 2(b). That paragraph prohibits solicitation by “threatening the \\nperson solicited with physical harm, by word or gesture.” Threats of violence do not come \\nwithin the scope of s. 2(b).153 I do not accept the applicant’s submission that conduct falling \\nwithin the scope of s. 2(3)1 attracts the protections of s. 2(b). A person who threatens \\nviolence against another takes away free choice and undermines freedom of action in the \\nsame manner as if the person actually committed the threatened act of violence.154 Threats \\nof violence are far beyond words spoken without civility, or words that merely cause \\nsubjective feelings of disquiet, unease, or fear in the listener.155 Threats of violence are not \\nprotected by s. 2(b) of the Charter. \\n[219] Third, I find that ss. 2 and 3 of the Act have the incidental purpose of controlling expressive \\nactivity.156 Sections 2 and 3 of the Act effect a direct and express restriction on freedom of \\n                                                 \\n \\n151 Banks CA, at paras. 114 to 123; see also, Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v.

(2)) or to people doing certain things in certain places (s. 3). Put \\ndifferently, section 3 of the Act is a complete ban on any solicitation by any means of \\npeople doing certain things at certain locations. Section 2 of the Act applies everywhere \\nbut restricts only a certain type of soliciting (that which would cause a reasonable person \\nto be concerned for his or her safety and security). \\n[220] In Banks, the Court of Appeal considered the larger statutory context of the Act and \\nconcluded that s. 3(2)(f) of the Act was intended to control the expressive activity of \\nsoliciting while on a roadway, which limited freedom of expression: \\nThe larger statutory context of the impugned provisions, which \\naddresses soliciting more directly, leads me to the conclusion that s. \\n3(2)(f) of the Act and s. 177(2) of the Highway Traffic Act were \\nintended to control the expressive activity of soliciting while on a \\nroadway. This conclusion does not detract from my earlier finding \\nthat their dominant aspect is the regulation of the interaction of \\npedestrians and vehicles on the roadways in the interests of public \\nsafety, efficient circulation, and public enjoyment of public \\nthoroughfares. It is simply that in achieving that overall objective \\nthe legislation has the incidental purpose of restricting soliciting \\nwhich is an expressive activity.157 \\n[221] Again, this holding of the Court Appeal applies with equal if not more force to the \\nprovisions under consideration in this application. \\n[222] In conclusion, I make the following findings: \\na. s. 2(2) limits a person’s rights under s. 2(b); \\nb. s. 2(3)1 does not limit a person’s rights under s. 2(b); and  \\nc. s. 2(3)2 to 6 limit a person’s rights under s. 2(b); and \\nd. 3(2)(a) to (e) limit a person’s rights under s. 2(b); \\nSection 1 \\n[223] I rely on, but will not repeat, the section 1 framework, found above at paragraphs [196] and \\n[197]. \\n                                                 \\n \\n157 Banks CA, at para. 126. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 55 \\n \\n \\nThe provisions have a sufficiently important objective \\n[224] A law that limits a constitutional right must do so in pursuit of a sufficiently important \\nobjective that is consistent with the values of a free and democratic society.158 The Court \\nof Appeal for Ontario recently reiterated the importance of precisely and succinctly stating \\nthe purpose of the law as distinguished from the means chosen to implement it: \\nThe Supreme Court has explained that the objective of a law must \\nnot be stated in too general terms because, otherwise, “it will provide \\nno meaningful check on the means employed to achieve it: almost \\nany challenged provision will likely be rationally connected to a \\nvery broadly stated purpose”: R. v.

On the other \\nhand, an articulation that is too narrow “may merely reiterate the \\nmeans chosen to achieve it”: Frank, at para. 46. On this basis, the \\nSupreme Court has stated that a law’s purpose should be “both \\nprecise and succinct” and distinguished from the means chosen to \\nimplement it: Moriarity, at para. 29; see also Thomson Newspapers \\nCo. v.

The Court of Appeal \\ndescribed the overall purpose of the Act as  \\nlegislation regulating the use of streets, sidewalks and public spaces \\nby the public, whether in vehicles or on foot, in the interests of \\nsafety, \\nefficient \\ncirculation, \\nand \\npublic \\nenjoyment \\nand \\nconvenience.160 \\n[226] Justice Dambrot, correctly in my view, held that the Legislative Assembly of Ontario \\nsought to achieve the purpose identified by the Court of Appeal through several means, \\neach of which had its own purpose, which needed to be considered in the context of the \\nAct in its entirety.161 Justice Dambrot identified the following purposes: \\nSection 2, including s. 2(3), is intended to promote the safe use of \\npublic places without the danger or harassment posed by interaction \\nwith those who solicit in an aggressive manner. \\n                                                 \\n \\n158 K.R.J. at para. 61. \\n159 Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association v.

At this stage, the court is only \\nconcerned with ensuring that “objectives which are trivial or discordant with the principles \\nintegral to a free and democratic society do not gain s. 1 protection.”163  \\n[229] I also do not accept Fair Change’s submission that the objectives of the Act are not pressing \\nand substantial because the Criminal Code protects sufficiently against criminal acts of \\nsolicitation. The Court of Appeal in Banks concluded that the Act fell within provincial \\njurisdiction. There is nothing constitutionally inappropriate about each level of government \\naddressing the same subject from a different perspective, provided that each is acting \\nwithin the bounds of its own constitutional jurisdiction. The fact that there may be some \\noverlap in how Ontario and the federal government have addressed these issues does not \\nrender the legislature’s objective insufficiently important to limit a constitutional right. \\n[230] Finally, I do not accept Fair Change’s submission that Ontario did not file evidence to \\nprove that “a meaningful portion of the public is afraid of or intimidated by non-criminal \\nacts of intimidation.” The Court of Appeal has held that this stage of the analysis “is not \\nusually an evidentiary contest.”164 The question to be determined is whether Ontario “has \\nasserted a pressing and substantial objective…[a] theoretical objective asserted as pressing \\nand substantial is sufficient for purposes of the s. 1 justification analysis….”165 \\n[231] I find that the infringing measures of the Act, considered in their legislative context, have \\na sufficiently important objective.166 In a free and democratic society, the government may \\nlegitimately attempt to regulate the use of streets, sidewalks, and public spaces in the \\ninterests of safety and efficiency.

First, with respect \\nto s. 2, it is reasonable to suppose that prohibiting aggressive solicitation may further \\nOntario’s legitimate goal of promoting the safe use of public spaces.170 Section 2 is, \\ntherefore, rationally connected to the objective of the infringing measure. Second, with \\nrespect to section 3, it is reasonable to suppose that prohibiting the solicitation of persons \\nat certain public places which those solicited persons are not free to leave may further \\nOntario’s legitimate purpose of promoting the safe use of public spaces. \\n[234] I do not accept Fair Change’s submission that there is no rational connection between s. 3 \\nand the legislative objective. Fair Change focusses on the lack of connection between \\nperceived aggression and solicitation in public spaces. In my view, Ontario does not need \\nto demonstrate a connection between perceived aggression and the legislative objective of \\ns. 3(2)(a) to (e). In my view, the legislative objective in s. 3 is different from the legislative \\nobjective in s. 2. It is only section 2, in my view, that directly targets aggressive solicitation. \\nSection 3 has its own, but different, rational connection to the legislative purpose. The \\npurpose of section 3 is to promote the safe use of public spaces that members of the public \\nare not free to leave. The provisions in s. 3 are rationally connected to that purpose. As I \\nwill point out below, however, the broad framing of the provisions in s. 3, while rationally \\nconnected to the legitimate legislative objective raise concerns about the minimal \\nimpairment of the right.  \\n[235] Further, even if Fair Change was correct that the Act has “virtually no deterrent effect,” in \\nmy view that is not relevant to the rational connection stage of the proportionality analysis. \\nA rational connection may be found on the basis of reason or logic and there is no need for \\ndirect proof of a relationship between the infringing measure and the legislative \\n                                                 \\n \\n167 K.R.J., at para. 68. \\n168 Carter, at para. 99. \\n169 Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v.

In \\nCarter, the Supreme Court of Canada described the test this way: \\nAt this stage of the analysis, the question is whether the limit on the \\nright is reasonably tailored to the objective. The inquiry into \\nminimal impairment asks “whether there are less harmful means of \\nachieving the legislative goal” (Hutterian Brethren, at para. 53). The \\nburden is on the government to show the absence of less drastic \\nmeans of achieving the objective “in a real and substantial manner” \\n(ibid., at para. 55). The analysis at this stage is meant to ensure that \\nthe deprivation of Charter rights is confined to what is reasonably \\nnecessary to achieve the state’s object.172 \\n[237] The court will show deference to the legislature’s choices, but Ontario must still prove that \\nthe law is carefully tailored so that rights are impaired no more than necessary.173 This does \\nnot mean, however, that the court should find a law minimally impairing simply because it \\ncan conceive of an alternative that might better tailor the objective to the infringement.174 \\n[238] I do not accept Fair Change’s submission that the provisions are not minimally impairing \\nbecause Ontario could simply rely on the existing provisions in the Criminal Code. Not \\nonly would I be reluctant to endorse expanding the application of the Criminal Code to \\nsituations where the police have not felt compelled to use those powers, but I also do not \\nfind that the Criminal Code is an apt limit on Ontario’s constitutional interests. \\n[239] I find that the restriction on aggressive solicitation in s. 2(2) of the Act is minimally \\nimpairing of the right freedom of expression. Soliciting in a manner that would cause a \\nreasonable person to be concerned for his or her safety and security has a coercive \\ncomponent. Not every solicitation, of course, is coercive. The state has placed a limit on \\nfreedom of expression at the point where the expression (the solicitation) would cause a \\nreasonable person to be concerned for their safety or security. Solicitation that does not \\nhave that effect is permitted. The limit chosen by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario is \\nminimally impairing of the right to freedom of expression.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n171 RJR-MacDonald, at paras. 154 and 184; R. v.

Aggressive solicitation is coercive in ways that justify its limitation. Certainly, \\nwhere the coercive activity approaches “borderline robbery,” to use the colourful phrase \\nfrom one of Ontario’s affidavits, regulation and restriction is proportional to the legitimate \\nobjectives of the state. A restriction on aggressive solicitation, as defined by the Act, is \\nminimally impairing of the right to freedom of expression. \\n[241] I do not accept the submission of the Ontario Human Rights Commission and the CCLA \\nthat s. 2(2) of the Act permits prosecutions based on subjective fears of the person being \\napproached. Such an interpretation is foreclosed by the text and meaning of s. 2(2). Indeed, \\nI find that the use of the reasonable person standard in s. 2(2) addresses many of the \\nlegitimate concerns expressed by Fair Change and the interveners regarding the potential \\nfor the prejudicial application of the Act. Let me explain. \\n[242] Section 2 is only violated where a reasonable person would be concerned for their safety \\nand security. The reasonable person is a judicial construct. This person must be reasonable \\nand right minded.176 In this case, the reasonable person must be fully aware of the social \\nand cultural context relevant to the solicitation.177 This would include the prevalence of \\nracism, gender bias, and prejudices against the mentally ill.178  \\n[243] The Supreme Court of Canada described prejudices as follows: \\nPrejudice is the holding of pejorative attitudes based on strongly \\nheld views about the appropriate capacities or limits of individuals \\nor the groups of which they are a member. Stereotyping, like \\nprejudice, is a disadvantaging attitude, but one that attributes \\ncharacteristics to members of a group regardless of their actual \\ncapacities. Attitudes of prejudice and stereotyping can undoubtedly \\nlead to discriminatory conduct, and discriminatory conduct in turn \\ncan reinforce these negative attitudes….179 \\n[244] The reasonable person would understand that racism and other prejudices and biases can \\naffect the way a person experiences a solicitation and would discount those prejudices.180 \\nIn other words, a person who subjectively experiences concern for their safety and security \\nduring a solicitation because of prejudices or stereotypes held about the person soliciting \\n                                                 \\n \\n175 K Mart, at para. 47. \\n176 Committee for Justice and Liberty v.

Such a person would not be a reasonable person \\nwithin the meaning of s. 2(2) of the Act.  \\n[245] It is helpful to illustrate this by considering an incident described in the record in this \\nproceeding. In his affidavit, Ashley Roberts described his experience with soliciting on a \\nTTC streetcar. For the moment, I will disregard the fact that s. 3(2)(d) of the Act explicitly \\nprohibits soliciting on a public transit vehicle and consider that the incident only through \\nthe lens of s. 2(2) of the Act. Mr. Roberts described his experience this way: \\nFor example, I used to beg people for money on the TTC because \\nthe TTC is usually safe, warm and there are lots of people with \\nchange to spare. I remember one time being on a streetcar and a lady \\ngot upset with me and thought I was being aggressive. I think it\\'s \\njust because of the way I looked because all I did was turn to look \\nat her. Because of my mental illness I sometimes stare at people. I \\nbelieve she was scared because my hair and my beard looked messy, \\nor because I\\'m a black man and over 6 feet tall. Even though I hadn\\'t \\ndone anything to this woman, the driver stopped the streetcar, told \\neveryone to get off except me, and called the police. Luckily there \\nwere people with me who were able to help explain what happened \\nwhen the police came and the police let me go. \\n[246] In this case, the fact that the woman on the streetcar was subjectively afraid of Mr. Roberts \\nwould not be sufficient to make out an offence under s. 2(2) of the Act. Mr. Roberts would \\nonly have violated s. 2(2) of the Act if a reasonable person would be concerned for their \\nsafety and security as a result of his solicitation. Here, the views of the other passengers \\nand their evidence about the interaction would be relevant to the determination of whether \\nor not a reasonable person would be concerned for their safety and security. Moreover, the \\nreasonable person’s concern would not be informed by prejudices regarding Mr. Roberts’ \\nrace, beard, or hair. A reasonable person would not be influenced by society’s prejudices \\nagainst people with mental illness and would focus on the effect of Mr. Roberts’ conduct. \\nIt would be for the police at first instance and ultimately the court to determine, based on \\nthe evidence and the circumstances, whether or not a reasonable person would have been \\nconcerned for his or her safety and security. If not, no conviction under s. 2(2) could follow, \\nregardless of the complainant’s subjective level of concern. \\n[247] When assessing whether or not a particular solicitation would cause a reasonable person to \\nbe concerned for their safety or security, it would be appropriate to consider all of the \\nrelevant circumstances: location, time of day, level of darkness, persistence of request, \\nimpeding of ability to walk away, and any peculiar vulnerabilities of the person solicited, \\nsuch as age or disability.  \\n[248] For the reasons set out above, I find that s. 2(2) of the Act minimally impairs the right to \\nfreedom of expression. The Legislature must be given some discretion to reach a sensible \\nbalance among the interests of all of the affected parties. In my view, prohibiting \\nexpression at the point where a reasonable person would be concerned for their safety and \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 61 \\n \\n \\nsecurity falls within constitutionally permissible parameters of reasonable alternatives.181 \\nThis is equally true for s. 2(3)1, which prohibits threatening the person solicited with \\nphysical harm. \\n[249] I have already found that the deeming provisions found in s. 2(3)2 to 6 limited the \\npresumption of innocence in s. 11(d) and that the limitation was not justified under section \\n1 of the Charter. For completeness, and for largely the same reasons, I would also find that \\nthe deeming provisions are not minimally impairing of the right to freedom of expression. \\nBecause the deeming provisions capture conduct that would not, considering all of the \\ncircumstance, prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person would have been \\nconcerned for their safety and security, those provisions are not minimally impairing of the \\nright to freedom of expression.  \\nSubsections 3(2)(a) to (e) of the Act do not minimally impair the right \\n[250] I reach a different conclusion about s. 3(2)(a) to (e) of the Act and find that those provisions \\nof the Act are not minimally impairing of the right of freedom of expression.  \\n[251] Recall that the accepted purpose of s. 3 is to promote the safe use of public places without \\ndanger or harassment: \\nSection 3 is intended to promote the safe use of public places \\nwithout the danger or harassment posed by interaction with those \\nsoliciting at places where members of the public are not free to leave \\nand be free from the solicitation.182 \\n[252] Subsections 3(2)(a) to (e) are not carefully tailored to achieve this purpose. Section 3 \\nprovides as follows: \\n3(2) No person shall, \\n(a) solicit a person who is using, waiting to use, or departing \\nfrom an automated teller machine; \\n(b) solicit a person who is using or waiting to use a pay \\ntelephone or a public toilet facility; \\n(c) solicit a person who is waiting at a taxi stand or a public \\ntransit stop; \\n(d) solicit a person who is in or on a public transit vehicle; \\n                                                 \\n \\n181 K Mart, at para. 63. \\n182 Banks SCJ, at para. 108. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 62 \\n \\n \\n(e) solicit a person who is in the process of getting in, out of, \\non or off a vehicle or who is in a parking lot… \\n[253] The section imposes a blanket ban on soliciting persons who are doing certain things at \\ncertain public places. It prohibits solicitation even if the solicitation: \\na. was conducted in a manner that was not coercive, intimidating, threatening, \\npersistent, or otherwise unlawful or tortious; \\nb. was passive, for example by holding up a sign; \\nc. did not impede access to or egress from the listed public places; \\nd. did not otherwise interfere with the use of the facilities in the listed public places; \\ne. was welcomed by the recipient of the solicitation; and \\nf. would not cause a reasonable person, or any person, to have concern for their safety \\nor security. \\n[254] Clauses 3(2)(a) to (e) are not minimally impairing of freedom of expression because they \\ncapture many solicitations that would not interfere with the safe use of public spaces and \\nwould pose no danger to, or harassment of the person solicited. For example, there is no \\ndoubt that an armed forces veteran or air cadet selling poppies on the sidewalk outside of \\na bank’s ATM is captured by ss. 3(2)(a) to (e). Similarly, a person sitting cross-legged on \\nthe sidewalk holding a sign asking for spare change outside of a bank’s ATM is captured \\nby ss. 3(2)(a) to (e). Indeed, on cross-examination Dr. Thacher admitted that a person could \\nrespectfully solicit money from someone waiting to use an ATM. The blanket approach in \\nss. 3(2)(a) to (e) of the Act is not minimally impairing of the right to free expression.  \\n[255] The mere presence of a homeless person soliciting gifts from persons doing certain things \\nat a prohibited site does not, on its own and without more, pose any danger or impediment \\nto the safe use of public space. Soliciting is of fundamental importance to persons in need \\nand has a real social value. Even if the presence of persons soliciting is annoying or even \\noffensive, a blanket ban on all solicitations it is not a proportional limit on freedom of \\nexpression. I find that ss. 3(2)(a) to (e) are not minimally impairing of the right.  \\n[256] This total prohibition on the solicitation of persons doing certain things in certain places is \\nnot carefully tailored to the objective of the provision.183 It is a broad sweep that captures \\nmore conduct than is justified by Ontario’s legitimate objective.184 This is particularly so \\ngiven the constitutional prohibition on aggressive solicitation in s. 2 of the Act. It is not \\n                                                 \\n \\n183 K Mart, at para. 74. \\n184 Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada, at p. 248. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 63 \\n \\n \\nminimally impairing of the right to prohibit all solicitation because some solicitations may \\ngive rise to conduct that may be properly regulated and restricted. \\n[257] Ontario did not provide any evidence to prove that no provision less impairing than s. 3 \\nwould accomplish its legislative objectives. Through the opinions of Prof. Thacher and \\nProf. Sousa, Ontario explained that “order maintenance policing or quality of life policing” \\nis the police role regulating the fair use of public spaces. Its main purpose is to safeguard \\nthe fair use of public spaces by enforcing standards of behavior that make those public \\nspaces accessible to everyone on reasonable terms and ensures that they can serve the \\npurposes that led to their creation. Ontario’s experts were of the opinion that the provisions \\nof the Act related to order maintenance and its goals.  \\n[258] Even if one accepts the premise of order maintenance policing, there was no evidence that \\ntailoring the provisions of s. 3 to be less impairing of freedom of expression would defeat \\nthe legitimate legislative objective. \\n[259] In his cross-examination, Dr. Thacher candidly acknowledged that “panhandling” might or \\nmight not be an unfair use of public space, depending on the details. I agree, but Dr. \\nThacher’s evidence does not support the necessity of a blanket ban on all forms of \\nsolicitation of people in certain public spaces. \\n[260] Moreover, in his affidavit, Dr. Thacher cited a model statute from the United States based \\nCriminal Justice Legal Foundation that prohibited “panhandling” at certain public \\nlocations. He stated that section 3 of the Act served a similar purpose: \\nThe provisions in section 3 of the Safe Streets Act appear to serve a \\nsimilar purpose (though they may serve other purposes as well). \\nPeople who are waiting to use an ATM, public bathroom, taxi, or \\npublic transit vehicle; people getting into or out of their cars; and \\npeople driving cars who have stopped on a roadway or in a parking \\nspot may all be captive audiences in the sense I have been \\ndescribing. Since they may not feel free to leave the encounter (or \\ncan only leave by abandoning their intended and lawful use of the \\npublic space, as when a person gets off the bus to avoid a \\npanhandler), they may experience solicitation in these contexts as \\nmore coercive than solicitation elsewhere. In that respect, narrow \\nrules prohibiting solicitation in these specific circumstances serve to \\naddress significant concerns about more coercive forms of \\nsolicitation while still permitting other forms of solicitation. \\n[261] During his cross-examination, Dr. Thacher properly conceded that the definition of \\n“panhandling” in the model statute excluded “passively standing or sitting with a sign or \\nany indication that one is seeking donations without addressing any solicitation to any \\nspecific person, other than in response to an inquiry by that person.” It appears to me, \\ntherefore, that the model statute relied on by Ontario’s expert in his affidavit was, in fact, \\nsignificantly less impairing of the right to freedom of expression than is section 3 of the \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 64 \\n \\n \\nAct. For clarity, I do not suggest that I would find the model statute to be constitutional. I \\nsimply point to it to demonstrate that Ontario’s evidence does not prove on a balance of \\nprobabilities that ss. 3(2)(a) to (e) minimally impairs the right. \\n[262] In conclusion, I find that ss. 3(2)(a) to (e) of the Act do not minimally impair freedom of \\nexpression. \\nDeleterious effects and benefits of the restriction \\n[263] The final stage of the proportionality analysis is the “balancing step.” The question is this: \\nare the overall effects of the law on the claimants disproportionate to the government’s \\nobjectives?185 The crux of the issue is whether the limit on the right is proportionate in \\neffect to the public benefit of the measure.186 The court should consider key questions, such \\nas: What benefits will the measure yield in terms of the collective good sought to be \\nachieved? How important is the limitation on the right? When one is weighed against the \\nother, is the limitation justified?”187  \\n[264] First, with respect to s. 2, I find that the limit on the right is proportionate to the \\ngovernments’ objectives. The speech at issue, aggressive solicitation as defined by the Act, \\nis of marginal value. While not excluded from protection under s. 2(b) like violence or \\nthreats of violence, solicitations that cause a reasonable person to be concerned for their \\nsafety or security lie far from the core of the right to free expression. The benefits to society \\nof regulating and restricting such behaviour, and being seen to do so, are significant. In my \\nview it is of no moment that some people who violate the Act do not think it is an effective \\ndeterrent. I would not give effect to such a submission. I find that the limitation found in s. \\n2(2) is justified.  \\n[265] Second, I need not consider this stage of the test with respect to s. 3(2)(a) to (e) because I \\nfound that the requirement of minimal impairment was not met. It is not necessary to \\nconsider the final stage of the proportionality analysis under s.1 of the Charter because “a \\nfinding that the law impairs the right more than required contradicts the assertion that the \\ninfringement is appropriate.”188 In any event, when I weigh the collective good to be \\nachieved against the importance of the limitation on the right, I conclude that the limitation \\nis not justified. \\nConclusion \\n[266] In conclusion, I make the following findings: \\n                                                 \\n \\n185 Alberta v.

I disagree. \\n[268] For convenience, s. 5 of the Act provides as follows: \\n5. (1) Every person who contravenes section 2, 3 or 4 is guilty of an \\noffence and is liable, \\n(a) on a first conviction, to a fine of not more than $500; and \\n(b) on each subsequent conviction, to a fine of not more than \\n$1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than six \\nmonths, or to both.  \\n(2) For the purpose of determining the penalty to which a person is \\nliable under subsection (1), \\n(a) a conviction of the person of a contravention of section 2 \\nis a subsequent conviction only if the person has previously \\nbeen convicted of a contravention of section 2 or 3; \\n(b) a conviction of the person of a contravention of section 3 \\nis a subsequent conviction only if the person has previously \\nbeen convicted of a contravention of section 2 or 3; and \\n(c) a conviction of the person of a contravention of section 4 \\nis a subsequent conviction only if the person has previously \\nbeen convicted of a contravention of section 4. \\n[269] Section 12 of the Charter provides that “Everyone has the right not to be subjected to any \\ncruel and unusual treatment or punishment.” Section 12 will be infringed where: \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 66 \\n \\n \\na. there is a state action that constitutes treatment or punishment; and \\nb. that treatment or punishment is cruel or unusual. \\nSection 5 of the Act is punishment \\n[270] State action will constitute a punishment where it is: \\na. a consequence of conviction that forms part of the arsenal of sanctions to which an \\naccused may be liable in respect of a particular offence; and either \\ni. is imposed in furtherance of the purpose and principles of sentencing; or \\nii. has a significant impact on an offender’s liberty or security interests.189 \\n[271] I accept that s. 5 of the Act constitutes a punishment and I do not understand Ontario to \\ndisagree. The next step is to determine whether or not the punishment imposed by s. 5 of \\nthe Act is cruel and unusual. \\nSection 5 of the Act is not cruel and unusual \\n[272] The phrase “cruel and unusual” captures two categories of punishment: \\na. punishments that are cruel or unusual by nature or intrinsically; and \\nb. punishments that are grossly disproportionate.190 \\nSection 5 is not intrinsically cruel and unusual \\n[273] The first inquiry asks, “whether a particular form of treatment or punishment is intrinsically \\ncruel and unusual.”191 The punishments contained in s. 5 of the Act, fines and the possibility \\nof imprisonment, are not intrinsically cruel and unusual. Indeed, they are the paradigmatic \\nmethods of punishment in Canadian society.192 Even a minimum mandatory term of \\nimprisonment, which s. 5 does not impose, is “obviously not in and of itself cruel and \\nunusual.”193 \\n[274] I find that the punishments contained in s. 5 of the Act are not intrinsically cruel and \\nunusual.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n189 K.R.J., at para. 41. \\n190 R. v.

Demonstrating that a punishment breaches \\ns. 12 because it is grossly disproportionate is a high bar.194 The challenged punishment \\nmust be more than merely disproportionate or excessive. Rather, “it must be ‘so excessive \\nas to outrage standards of decency’ and ‘abhorrent or intolerable to society.’”195  \\n[276] Fair Change places great emphasis on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in \\nBoudreault.196 In my view, neither the methodology nor the result in Boudreault assist the \\napplicant. \\n[277] In Boudreault, the Supreme Court of Canada considered a provision of the Criminal Code \\nthat required anyone who is discharged, pleads guilty, or is found guilty of an offence to \\npay monies to the state as a “mandatory victim surcharge.” The amount was set by law and \\nwas owed for each and every summary conviction or indictable offence. As of October \\n2013, the amount of the surcharge was 30% of any fine imposed, or, where there was no \\nfine, $100 for every summary conviction count and $200 for every indictable count.197 The \\nsurcharge applied regardless of the severity of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, \\nor the effects of the crime on the victim.198 Judges had to impose the surcharge in every \\ncase. They had no discretion to decrease or waive the surcharge.  \\n[278] In Boudreault, the Supreme Court applied the test from Nur to determine whether or not \\nthe mandatory victim surcharge violated s. 12.199 As a first step, the court was required to \\nassess the individuals before the court. This is the first methodological problem for Fair \\nChange. \\n[279] On this application, there is neither an offender nor a specific sentence before the court. \\nThis is a direct consequence of how Fair Change chose to mount this application. If Fair \\nChange had acted as counsel for one of its clients facing a charge under the Act, the court \\nwould have had a specific case to consider. Instead, Fair Change brought this application \\nwith public interest standing. There is, therefore, no individual before the court with a \\nfactual record to inform a consideration of whether a specific sentence was grossly \\ndisproportionate for a specific offender in their particular circumstances for their particular \\noffence. Fair Change has not met the test at the first stage of the inquiry.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n194 R. v.

The Court asked \\nwhat a fit sentence would be for the representative offenders according to the general \\nprinciples of sentencing. The court asked, “what sentencing judges would impose if they \\nretained their discretion to consider the individual circumstances of the offenders and the \\nnature of their sentences.”200 The key question for the court in Boudreault was, therefore, \\nwhether a judge who had a choice would impose the surcharge. The Supreme Court held \\nthat if the sentencing judge had the discretion not to impose the mandatory victim surcharge \\non the individuals before the court, the judge would not have done so. The Court \\nemphasized the importance of individualized discretion in sentencing: \\nThis is because sentencing is first and foremost an individualized \\nexercise, which balances the various goals of sentencing, while \\ntaking into account the particular circumstances of the offender as \\nwell as the nature and number of his or her crimes. When sentencing, \\nthe crucial issue on the surcharge is whether or not the particular \\nindividuals before the courts are able to pay, and in this case they \\nare not. In a constitutional context, the court is also called upon to \\nconsider the rights of particular individuals who may be affected by \\nthis punishment in a way that is grossly disproportionate, \\nunderstanding that people have varied life situations and many are \\nimpecunious, impoverished, ill, disabled, addicted and/ or otherwise \\ndisadvantaged. Given this focus, it is less important that other \\nindividuals who are differentially situated may be able to pay, that \\nsome other fines set by law may be higher or that the amount of the \\nsurcharge depends on the number of offences committed.201 \\n[281] The Court held that the disproportionate financial consequences of the surcharge arose \\nbecause judges imposing the surcharge could not exercise any discretion in the event that \\nthe offender was unable to pay or in the event an offender’s moral culpability was so low \\nthat the sentencing judge decided that they ought to be absolutely or conditionally \\ndischarged.202 In doing so, the victim surcharge regime ignored proportionality, which is \\nthe fundamental principle of sentencing, mitigating factors, principles of parity, and \\nrehabilitation.203 The fatal flaw in the mandatory victim surcharge scheme was the fact that \\nit left judges with no choice and no ability to exercise their discretion to tailor the sentence \\nto the circumstances of the offender: \\nIt leaves sentencing judges with no choice. They must impose the \\nsurcharge in every case. They cannot consider the most \\nmarginalized offenders’ inability to pay, the likelihood that they will \\nface a repeated deprivation of liberty for committal hearings, or the \\nindefinite nature of the punishment. They cannot apply the \\n                                                 \\n \\n200 Boudreault, at para. 56. \\n201 Boudreault, at para. 58. \\n202 Boudreault, at paras. 66 and 68. \\n203 Boudreault, at para. 81.  \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 69 \\n \\n \\nfundamental principles of sentencing, seek to foster rehabilitation in \\nappropriate cases, or adjust the sentence for Indigenous offenders. \\nTo return to the ultimate question in these appeals, the impact and \\neffects of the surcharge, taken together, create circumstances that \\nare grossly disproportionate, outrage the standards of decency, and \\nare both abhorrent and intolerable. Put differently, they are cruel and \\nunusual, and, therefore, violate s. 12.204 \\n[282] Section 5 of the Act, however, is nothing like the mandatory victim surcharge struck down \\nin Boudreault. Section 5 provides that a person found guilty of contravening section 2 or 3 \\nis liable to a fine, but the Act does not specify a minimum fine. Even on a subsequent \\nconviction, the Act still does not provide for a minimum fine. Section 5 of the Act also \\ndoes not provide for a minimum term of imprisonment.  \\n[283] As noted above, if the offence proceeds under Part I, an accused may plead guilty with \\nrepresentation as to penalty to be made before a justice or may plead not guilty and have a \\ntrial. The Provincial Offences Act gives the court the discretion to impose a fine that is less \\nthan any prescribed minimum or suspend the sentence where it finds exceptional \\ncircumstances that would make imposing the minimum unduly oppressive or otherwise not \\nin the interest of justice.205 The court has the discretion to make inquiries of and concerning \\ndefendant, including as to the defendant’s economic circumstances, when crafting an \\nappropriate sentence. Where the court imposes a fine, the court is required to ask the \\ndefendant if they wish an extension of time, and such a request shall be granted unless the \\ncourt finds that the request is not made in good faith or that it the extension would be used \\nto avoid payment. The sentencing justice under the Provincial Offences Act is obliged to \\nimpose a fit sentence in every case.206 This includes consideration of Gladue factors and \\nthe ability to pay. Nothing in the Act limits that obligation or constrains the sentencing \\njudge in the exercise of their discretion to impose a fit sentence. The same is true for each \\ncourt hearing an appeal from a sentence imposed for a violation of the Act.  \\n[284] Fair Change submits that, even if the sentencing justices have this discretion, they rarely \\nexercise it because most hearings proceed in the absence of the accused and the sentencing \\njudges typically impose the set fine amounts. Justice for Children and Youth emphasize \\nthis point with respect to youths and submit that the fact that “almost all SSA tickets are \\nprosecuted ex parte is but one specific demonstration of the ways in which young people’s \\nCharter rights are violated by the Act.” I do not accept these submissions. \\n[285] First, nothing about s. 5 of the Act speaks to the process by which the sentence is imposed. \\nThe procedure for charging, processing, findings of guilt are contained in the Provincial \\nOffences Act, not s. 5 of the Act. \\n                                                 \\n \\n204 Boudreault, at para. 94. \\n205 Provincial Offences Act, s. 9.1.  \\n206 R. v.

C.A.), at p. 294. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 70 \\n \\n \\n[286] Second, the fact that many accused persons do not exercise their right to a hearing before \\na sentencing justice who has the discretion to impose a fit sentence cannot convert an \\notherwise constitutional sentencing regime into one that violates s. 12 of the Charter. \\n[287] Third, the set fine amounts are not imposed by the Act. Under s. 91.1 of the Provincial \\nOffences Act, the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice may specify an amount as \\nthe set fine for the purpose of proceedings under Part I of the Provincial Offences Act.207 \\nThere is no obligation on a sentencing justice to impose the set fine amount. Fair Change \\nhas not challenged s. 91.1 of the Provincial Offences Act or any particular set amount.  \\n[288] Fair Change submits that the Act imposes “astronomical fines and lengthy jail terms” on \\nvulnerable people. I disagree. The text of s. 5 does not prescribe a minimum fine, much \\nless one that is “astronomical,” even considering the very limited means demonstrated by \\nFair Change’s affiants. Section 5 also does not prescribe “lengthy jail terms.” \\n[289] I accept that the affidavit evidence of Mr. Dunbar and Mr. Roberts demonstrates that they \\nincurred many fines under the Act and that those fines added up to a significant amount \\nowing. However, I do not accept that this eventuality transforms the open-ended \\nsanctioning regime created by s. 5 of the Act into one that imposes cruel or unusual \\npunishment contrary to s. 12 of the Charter.  \\n[290] I dismiss Fair Change’s challenge to s. 5 of the Act under s. 12 of the Charter.  \\n \\n9. \\nSection 7 – the right to life, liberty and security of the person \\n[291] Section 7 of the Charter provides that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of \\nthe person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles \\nof fundamental justice. Life, liberty and security of the person are interests protected by s. \\n7, but the section is only violated if the infringement of those interests is not in accordance \\nwith the principles of fundamental justice. \\n[292] Fair Change submits that sections 2, 3, and 5 of the Act violate the rights to life, liberty, \\nand security of the person. Fair Change submits that these deprivations violate the \\nprinciples of fundamental justice because the impugned provisions of the Act are arbitrary, \\noverbroad, and grossly disproportionate.  \\n[293] I have already found that ss. 2(3)2 to 2(3)6 violate s. 11(d) of the Charter but paragraph \\n2(3)1 does not. A finding that s. 11(d) has been infringed necessarily entails that s. 7 has \\nalso been infringed.208 I rely on my conclusions above and reiterate that ss. 2(3)2 to 2(3)6 \\nviolate the right to liberty and do so in a manner that is not in accordance with the principles \\nof fundamental justice. \\n                                                 \\n \\n207 2682283 Ontario Ltd, at para. 9. \\n208 Rose, at para. 96. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 71 \\n \\n \\nThe Act implicates the right to liberty \\n[294] Both parties agree that because a person charged under the Act faces potential \\nimprisonment for that conduct if an offence is charged under Part III of the Provincial \\nOffences Act, that is sufficient to engage an accused person’s s. 7 right to liberty.209 In \\nBanks, the Court of Appeal confirmed that the Act engages the s. 7 right to liberty.210 \\nThe Act does not implicate the right to life or to security of the person \\n[295] I do not accept Fair Change’s submissions that the Act implicates either the right to life or \\nsecurity of the person. I also do not accept the submission by the CCLA that the \\nprohibitions under the Act “criminalize the only way they can meet their basic needs.” \\n[296] The Court of Appeal in Banks considered and rejected similar submissions.211 The Court \\nof Appeal held that the Act did not deny persons the economic means necessary for their \\nsurvival. The Court of Appeal held that the Act left “the appellants free to beg or provide \\na service in exchange for alms in any circumstances and settings not prohibited by the \\nAct.”212 Although the Court of Appeal was only considering s. 3(2)(f), the reasoning of the \\nCourt of Appeal squarely applies to the submissions made in this case. Similarly, I do not \\naccept that the decision in Gosselin, which held that the right to security of the person may \\nbe infringed by deprivations of “economic rights fundamental to human…survival,” \\napplies to the prohibitions in the Act.213 I do not accept the submission that the Act prohibits \\nthe “only way” that persons can solicit donations. The text of the Act and the Court of \\nAppeal’s decision in Banks make that clear. \\n[297] I disagree with the submission of Fair Change and several interveners that the decision of \\nthe Supreme Court of Canada in Bedford undermines the reasoning of the Court of Appeal. \\nThe evidence presented does not persuade me that the Act makes the lawful activity of \\nsoliciting more dangerous.214 I do not accept the submission that the Act imposes death or \\nan increased risk of death, directly or indirectly. In my view, I remain bound by the \\nreasoning of the Court of Appeal. \\n[298] I also do not accept the submissions of the Income Security Advocacy Centre that adopting \\nan “intersectional equality lens” assessing barriers imposed by disability and social \\nassistance means that security of the person is implicated in this case. Even accounting for \\nthe “intersecting vulnerabilities of social assistance recipients with disabilities,” the Act \\ndoes not implicate security of the person and the Act’s “intrusions on physical and \\npsychological integrity” are not sufficiently serious to engage security of the person.

Whether or not courts have \\n“recognized state deprivations to basic necessities of life as breaching security of the \\nperson,” the Act does not have that effect.  \\n[299] I find that the Act does not implicate the rights to life or security of the person that are \\nprotected by s. 7 of the Charter.  \\nAny deprivation of the right to liberty does not violate the principles of fundamental justice \\n[300] Whether or not a law complies with s. 7 of the Charter turns on a proper assessment of the \\nlaw’s objective.215 Laws run afoul of our basic values when the means by which the state \\nseeks to attain its objective is fundamentally flawed, in the sense of being arbitrary, \\noverbroad, or having effects that are grossly disproportionate to the legislative goal.216 The \\nSupreme Court explained how these principles address two different evils: \\nThe \\ncase \\nlaw \\non \\narbitrariness, \\noverbreadth \\nand \\ngross \\ndisproportionality is directed against two different evils. The first \\nevil is the absence of a connection between the infringement of \\nrights and what the law seeks to achieve — the situation where the \\nlaw’s deprivation of an individual’s life, liberty, or security of the \\nperson is not connected to the purpose of the law. The first evil is \\naddressed by the norms against arbitrariness and overbreadth, which \\ntarget the absence of connection between the law’s purpose and the \\ns. 7 deprivation. \\nThe second evil lies in depriving a person of life, liberty or security \\nof the person in a manner that is grossly disproportionate to the law’s \\nobjective. The law’s impact on the s. 7 interest is connected to the \\npurpose, but the impact is so severe that it violates our fundamental \\nnorms.217 \\n[301] Fair Change submits that the Act violates the right to liberty because s. 2 and 3 are arbitrary, \\noverbroad, and grossly disproportionate. For the reasons that follow, I disagree. \\n[302] For convenience, I restate the objectives of the Act. Ontario and Fair Change agree that the \\nobjectives of the Act are those found in the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the \\nSuperior Court of Justice in Banks. The Court of Appeal described the overall purpose of \\nthe Act as:  \\n                                                 \\n \\n215 R. v. N.S., 2022 ONCA 160, 169 O.R.

Fair Change \\nhas not proven that the Act is inconsistent with its objective or that the Act is unnecessary. \\n[306] As I have explained above, I find that ss. 2(3)2 to 6 violate the presumption of innocence \\nand limit the right to freedom of expression and that the limitations are not justifiable under \\ns. 1 of the Charter. I disagree, however, with Fair Change’s submission that s. 2(3)2 to 6 \\nare arbitrary. In my view, those paragraphs are not arbitrary. Those provisions are \\nconnected the object of s. 2 and are capable of fulfilling its purposes. \\n[307] In my view, both s. 2 and 3 are capable of fulfilling the objectives of the Act.223 I rely on \\nmy reasons in paragraphs [232] to [235], which explain why I found that s. 2 and 3 were \\n                                                 \\n \\n218 Banks CA, at para. 32. \\n219 See also, Gordon, at paras 197 to 198. \\n220 Banks SCJ, at para. 108. \\n221 Carter, at para. 83. \\n222 Bedford, at para. 111. \\n223 Carter, at para. 83. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 74 \\n \\n \\nrationally connected to the objectives of the legislation for the purposes of the s. 1 analysis. \\nThose reasons also explain why the Act is not arbitrary. \\nThe Act is not overbroad  \\n[308] Overbreadth is a distinct principle of fundamental justice that is related to arbitrariness. \\nThe question in both cases is whether there is no connection between the effects of a law \\nand its objective. The overbreadth principle “allows the court to recognize that the lack of \\nconnection arises in a law that goes too far by sweeping conduct into its ambit that bears \\nno relation to its objective.224 \\n[309] Subsection 2(2) is not overbroad. I find that prohibiting solicitation in a manner that is \\nlikely to cause a reasonable person to be concerned for his or her safety or security does \\nnot capture conduct that has no relation to the objective of the statute. I disagree with Fair \\nChange’s submission that the deeming provisions of ss. 2(3)2 to 6 demonstrate \\noverbreadth. Those provisions do not sweep conduct into their ambit that bears no relations \\nto their objective. There is a relationship between the objective and the deeming provisions, \\neven if those provisions violate both of s. 2(b) and s. 11(d) of the Charter.  \\n[310] I also disagree with Fair Change’s submission that s. 3(2) is overbroad because it captures \\nconduct that “does not generate fear and intimidate others.” Fair Change errs by comparing \\nthe objective of s. 2 (prohibiting aggressive solicitation) with the reach of s. 3 (prohibitions \\non soliciting persons doing certain things in certain places). For example, the prohibition \\non soliciting on roadways upheld in Banks does not merely target solicitation that generates \\nfear and intimidates others (although it also captures that conduct in certain places). When \\ns. 3 is measured against its own objective, it is not impermissibly overbroad. \\n[311] Fair Change submits that the provisions are overbroad because persons with “mental \\nillnesses, cognitive challenges and impairments…are unable to understand and process the \\nshort and long-term implications of fines.” The evidence tendered by Fair Change does not \\nsupport such a sweeping conclusion. Moreover, by extension, this submission would have \\nthe effect of declaring every regulatory offence and Criminal Code provision overbroad. \\nNo such conclusion is warranted. \\n[312] Finally, I do not accept Fair Change’s submission that the Act is overbroad because, in \\ncases that are not before the court, police officers may have issued “fake tickets.” The \\nimproper or unlawful administration of an otherwise constitutional law does not render that \\nlaw unconstitutionally overbroad. The court expects police officers to comply with their \\nobligations and to discharge their duties in a manner that is consistent with their \\nconstitutional obligations. A person facing charges as a result of unlawful or \\nunconstitutional conduct by the police may seek an individual remedy under s. 24(1) or s. \\n                                                 \\n \\n224 Bedford, at para. 117. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 75 \\n \\n \\n24(2) of the Charter, but such misfeasance does not render unconstitutional an otherwise \\nconstitutional law.225 \\n[313] I conclude that ss. 2 and 3 of the Act are not overbroad. \\nThe Act is not grossly disproportionate \\n[314] The rule against gross disproportionality applies only in extreme cases where the \\nseriousness of the deprivation of liberty is totally out of sync with the objective of the \\nmeasure. The Supreme Court expressed the idea of gross disproportionality in the \\nfollowing hypothetical: a law with the purposes of keeping the streets clean that imposes a \\nsentence of life imprisonment for spitting on the sidewalk.226 \\n[315] Even if I accept Fair Change’s submission that the objective of the Act and its prohibitions \\non solicitation are analogous to the Supreme Court’s hypothetical law against spitting on \\nthe sidewalk, the comparison falters when one examines the penalties in the Act and \\ncompares them to life imprisonment.  \\n[316] Section 5 of the Act states that a person convicted of an offence under the Act is liable to \\na fine of not more than $500 or $1000. There is no minimum fine. There is no minimum \\nterm of imprisonment. In certain cases, a person convicted of an offence under the Act \\ncould be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months, which is a far \\ncry from a sentence of life imprisonment. I rely on my reasons in paragraphs [275] to [290] \\nto explain why I find that the Act does not impose grossly disproportionate penalties. \\n[317] I am satisfied that the connection between the objectives of the Act and its impact cannot \\nfairly be described as draconian or outside the norms accepted in our free and democratic \\nsociety.227 This is particularly true given the lack of mandatory minimum fines or terms of \\nimprisonment. \\n[318] I find that the Act is not grossly disproportionate. This is not a case where the seriousness \\nof the deprivation of liberty is totally out of sync with the objective of the measure. \\nConclusion \\n[319] I find that paragraphs 2(3)2 to 6 violate s. 7 of the Charter because they violate the \\npresumption of innocence, contrary to s. 11(d). Otherwise, I dismiss Fair Change’s \\nchallenge to s. 2, 3, and 5 of the Act pursuant to s. 7 of the Charter. \\n                                                 \\n \\n225 R. v.

It must prove on a balance of probabilities that: \\na. the Act creates a distinction, on its face or in its impact, on the basis of an \\nenumerated or analogous ground (Step One); and \\nb. the distinction imposes a burden or denies a benefit in a discriminatory manner, by \\nhaving the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating disadvantage (Step \\nTwo).228 \\n[322] The analysis in each step must remain distinct because the two steps ask different questions. \\nEven if I conclude that the Act has a disproportionate impact, that does not automatically \\nmean that the distinction is discriminatory. \\n[323] It is important to note that, on its face, the Act does not draw any distinctions based on an \\nenumerated or analogous ground protected by s. 15 of the Charter. The Act requires all \\npersons to refrain from doing certain things.  \\n[324] Fair Change alleges that the Act, although neutral on its face, violates s. 15 because of its \\nadverse effects. Fair Change must show, therefore, that the Act has a disproportionate \\nimpact on members of a protected group.229 This can be demonstrated in several ways, \\nincluding if there are clear disparities in how a law affects the claimant’s group as \\ncompared to other comparator groups.230 Where a claimant alleges indirect discrimination, \\nthe claimant will have “more work to do” at the first step.231 \\n                                                 \\n \\n228 Fraser v.

This \\nnecessarily involves drawing a comparison between the claimant group and other groups, \\nor the general population.232  \\n[326] Fair Change did not specify who the proper comparator group should be for the purpose of \\nthe s. 15 analysis. The first step of the s. 15 test requires Fair Change to establish that the \\nAct creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact on the basis of a protected ground. \\nThis requirement of a disproportionate impact involves some element of a comparison with \\nothers. It is difficult to assess Fair Change’s submissions for any of the protected groups \\nwithout a carefully defined comparator group. \\n[327] All laws are expected to impact individuals, including members of protected groups. It is \\nnot sufficient for Fair Change simply to show that the law impacts groups of individuals \\nprotected by section 15. Instead, Fair Change must prove on a balance of probabilities that \\nthe Act created or contributed to a disproportionate impact on a protected group as \\ncompared to non-group members.233 It must do so by presenting sufficient evidence to \\nprove that the Act creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact on the basis of a \\nprotected ground. At Step One, causation is the central issue, and it is important to \\ndistinguish between adverse impacts caused or contributed to by the impugned law and \\nthose that exist independently of it.234 Justice Abella explained it this way: \\n… [I]ntuition may well lead us to the conclusion that the provision \\nhas some disparate impact, but before we put the [government] to \\nthe burden of justifying a breach of s. 15…, there must be enough \\nevidence to show a prima facie breach. While the evidentiary burden \\nneed not be onerous, the evidence must amount to more than a web \\nof instinct.235 \\n[328] To prove that legislation creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact on members of \\na protected group, an applicant may provide evidence about the circumstances of the \\nclaimant group as well as evidence about the results produced by the challenged law. \\nIdeally, an applicant should provide both.236 This could include statistical evidence \\nshowing a disparate pattern of exclusion or harm that is statistically significant and not \\nsimply the result of chance.237 \\n                                                 \\n \\n232 Sharma, at para. 32, citing Andrews v.

However, an applicant must still fulfill \\nthe evidentiary burden. A sufficient evidentiary record is not “a mere technicality.”238 I will \\nfollow the Supreme Court’s guidance from Sharma regarding the evidence at step one of \\nthe inquiry, which includes that: \\n(a) No specific form of evidence is required. \\n(b) The claimant need not show the impugned law or state action \\nwas the only or the dominant cause of the disproportionate impact \\n⸺ they need only demonstrate that the law was a cause (that is, the \\nlaw created or contributed to the disproportionate impact on a \\nprotected group). \\n(c) The causal connection may be satisfied by a reasonable \\ninference. Depending on the impugned law or state action at issue, \\ncausation may be obvious and require no evidence. Where evidence \\nis required, courts should remain mindful that statistics may not be \\navailable. Expert testimony, case studies, or other qualitative \\nevidence may be sufficient. In all circumstances, courts should \\nexamine evidence that purports to demonstrate a causal connection \\nto ensure that it conforms with standards associated to its \\ndiscipline.239 \\n[330] As noted above, I have significant concerns about the reliability of some of the expert \\nevidence that Fair Change relies on to support its s. 15 Charter challenge. I will address \\nthese concerns below but in general, I give that evidence little weight where I am not \\nsatisfied that the evidence is reliable.  \\nAge \\n[331] Fair Change submits that the Act “contributes to a disproportionate impact on…youth,” \\nwhich it explains is a protected group falling within the listed category of age.  \\n[332] Fair change appears to define “youths” as those persons between the ages of 16 and 24. \\nFair Change did not explain why adults from age 18 to 24 should be considered “youths” \\nfor the purpose of the s. 15 analysis.240 In its factum, relying on academic articles that did \\nnot form part of the record, Justice for Children and Youth explained that people between \\n                                                 \\n \\n238 Ontario Teacher Candidates Council, at para. 81. \\n239 Sharma, at para. 49, citing R. v.

Youths make \\nup 20-30% of the homeless population compared to 13% of all \\nCanadians…. Youths…who are homeless are particularly \\nvulnerable to criminal victimization. \\n[335] I will address the final submission, that youths experiencing homelessness are particularly \\nvulnerable to criminal victimization, first. This appears to be an interpretation of the \\nevidence of Dr. Hermer. In its factum, Justice for Children and Youth also placed great \\nemphasis on the fact that street youth are victims of violent crime at a very high rate. While \\nthe vulnerability of homeless youth to themselves becoming the victims of crime is \\nobviously disturbing, that evidence is not relevant to whether or not the Act creates or \\ncontributes to a disproportionate impact on youths.  \\n[336] The first two points above are drawn from the affidavit of Dr. O’Grady. In preparing his \\nopinion, Dr. O’Grady reviewed a 2013 publication he co-authored called Tickets… And \\nMore Tickets: A case study of the enforcement of the Ontario Safe Streets Act.242 This study \\nwas not exhibited to his original opinion, but was exhibited to his reply affidavit. This study \\nreviewed official police statistical data on the number of tickets issued by the Toronto \\nPolice Service under the Act from 2000 to 2010, and concluded that tickets were given \\nmore often to adults than to youths. He wrote: \\nAs shown in Table 1, there is little doubt that [Act] tickets issued by \\nthe TPS between 2005 and 2009 were given more often to adults (25 \\nand over) than to youth. In fact, the modal age of those who were \\nticketed over this period was 43 years. This fact is likely attributable \\nto the higher number of adults than youth in Toronto’s homeless \\n                                                 \\n \\n241 At the time they swore their affidavits, Gerry Williams was 46, Donald Dunbar was 52, Margaret Bunting was \\n68, and Ashley Roberts was 65. \\n242 Bill O’Grady, Stephen Gaetz, and Kristy Buccieri, “Tickets… And More Tickets: A case study of the \\nenforcement of the Ontario Safe Streets Act,” Canadian Public Policy, Vol. 39, No. 4 (December 2013), pp. 541-\\n558. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 80 \\n \\n \\npopulation. Adults may also have acquired more tickets as a result \\nof extended time spent on the street. \\n[337] Table 1 contained the following data: \\n \\n[338] The Table 1 data do not support Fair Change’s submission that that Act has a \\ndisproportionate impact on youths. Fair Change submits that youths make up 13% of \\nCanada’s population and between 20% and 30% of the homeless population. The data in \\nTable 1 indicate that youths received between 4.8% and 6.3% of the tickets under the Act \\nduring the period of the study. \\n[339] Dr. O’Grady reviewed one other report that contained data on youths receiving tickets \\nunder the Act. That study was titled “Can I see your ID?”243 This study consisted of \\ninterviews with 244 homeless youth between the ages of 16 and 25.

In the prior 12 months, 85.4% of youths self-identifying as male \\nreported that they had never come in to contact with the police because of panhandling or \\nsqueegeeing and 9.00% reported more than one incident of contact with the police for that \\nreason. In contrast, 34.3% of female identifying youths and 49% of male identifying youths \\nreported being arrested by the police in the prior year. \\n[342] Table 9 of the study reported survey results from 215 youths and described the percentage \\nof street youth receiving tickets from the police in the prior 12 months. The data were not \\nbroken down by gender of the survey respondent. Of the 215 respondents: \\na. 90.3% reported never receiving a ticket for panhandling or squeegeeing; \\nb. 4.1% reported receiving one ticket for panhandling or squeegeeing;  \\nc. 2.8% reported receiving 2-5 tickets for panhandling or squeegeeing; and \\nd. 2.8% reported receiving more than five tickets for panhandling or squeegeeing. \\n[343] The study noted that it appeared that there were few youths in the sample who received \\ntickets under the Act. Indeed, fewer than 10% of the youth in the study received a ticket \\nunder the Act. The study concluded: \\nThe type of behaviour that warranted the most ticketing attention \\nfrom the police was drinking in public, as 22% of the sample \\nreported that they had received at least one ticket from the police \\nover the last year for drinking in public. This was followed by \\n“hanging around with friends” “walking down the street,” “sitting \\nin a park” and “doing drugs in public.” Interestingly, it appears there \\nwere few youth in the sample who received [Act] tickets. According \\nto our survey data, fewer than 10% of the sample received at least \\none ticket that could be related to the [Act] (e.g, aggressive \\npanhandling and squeegee cleaning). As we discussed earlier, these \\nnumbers correspond with the data obtained from the Toronto Police \\nService on SSA tickets issued, by age of accused. These figures \\nshow that from 2004 to 2010 10.2% of [Act] tickets were issued to \\nthose 24 years of age and under (data obtained from the Toronto \\nPolice Service and the Ministry of the Attorney General, Court \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 82 \\n \\n \\nServices Division as a result of an Access to Information request \\nfiled in 2009 and 2011).244 \\n[344] On cross-examination, Dr. O’Grady admitted that the survey data revealed that “basically, \\n[there] is virtually no association” between age and receiving tickets under the Act.  \\n[345] I do not accept the submission of Justice for Children and Youth that the Act’s “Charter \\nviolations are particularly apparent and egregious and are brought into sharp relief when \\nconsidered as they relate to young people.” There is no evidence in the record to support \\nthis submission. \\n[346] Justice for Children and Youth submits that “Children and young people who are homeless \\nand street-involved are disproportionately affected by the SSA, both in its application and \\nby the consequences of its enforcement.” Even if I accept Justice for Children and Youth’s \\nsubmission that a “contextual and intersectional analysis is required to properly consider \\nthe impact of the [Act] on the Charter rights of young people,” I am not satisfied that the \\nevidence presented by Fair Change demonstrates that the Act creates or contributes to a \\ndisproportionate impact on a protected group on the basis of age.  \\n[347] Justice for Children and Youth also submits that I should ground my analysis in the United \\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the General Comment No. 21 (2017), and \\nthe best interests of the child test. Leaving aside the methodological challenge of using a \\nbest interest of the child test in assessing the constitutionality of this Act, based on the \\nevidence before me, I do not see how that approach, or the convention, demonstrates that \\nthe Act discriminates on the basis of age.  \\n[348] To prove that legislation creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact on members of \\na protected group, an applicant may provide evidence about the circumstances of the \\nclaimant group as well as evidence about the results produced by the challenged law. \\nIdeally, an applicant should provide both.245 I find that Fair Change has not proven that the \\nAct creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact on youths.  \\nLGBTQ persons \\n[349] Fair Change submits that the Act “contributes to a disproportionate impact on…LGBTQ \\npeople.” There is no doubt that sexual orientation is a ground of discrimination that is \\nanalogous to those enumerated in s. 15 of the Charter.246 There is also growing judicial \\nrecognition of the rights of transgender individuals in Canada.247  \\n                                                 \\n \\n244 O’Grady, Gaetz and Buccieri, “Can I see your ID?,” at p. 49. \\n245 Fraser, at para. 60; Sharma, at para. 49 \\n246 Egan v. Canada, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513; M. v. H., [1999] 2 S.C.R. 3.  \\n247 Hansman v. Neufeld, 2023 SCC 14, at paras. 82 to 88 and the cases cited therein. Specifically, Centre for Gender \\nAdvocacy v. Attorney General of Quebec, 2021 QCCS 191, 481 C.R.R. (2d) 273, at paras. 104 and 106, recognized \\ngender identity as a ground of discrimination analogous to the grounds listed in s. 15 of the Charter. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 83 \\n \\n \\n[350] None of Fair Change’s affiants self-identifies as an LGBTQ person, so there is no first-\\nhand evidence in the record. Fair Change summarizes its evidence on this point as follows: \\nFinally… LGBTQ people are overrepresented among the homeless \\nand, by implication, those who panhandle…. LGBTQ people \\nconstitute 25-40% of the street youth population in Canada, yet only \\ncomprise 5-10% of all Canadians. Youths and individuals with non-\\nconforming sexual and gender identity (as well as Indigenous \\npeople, women, and black males) who are homeless are particularly \\nvulnerable to criminal victimization. \\n[351] Fair Change makes the following submissions in support of its argument that the Act has \\na disproportionate impact on LGBTQ persons:  \\nAt the first step of the s. 15 test: the enforcement of ss. 2, 3, and 5 \\nof the SSA contributes to a disproportionate impact on…LGBTQ \\npeople…. These groups are all significantly overrepresented among \\nthe population of individuals who panhandle….While there are no \\nstatistics showing that, when enforcing the SSA, the police \\ndisproportionately targets…LGBTQ people…identical treatment by \\npolice officers and courts of individuals who panhandle has an \\nunequal impact on these groups because of their overrepresentation. \\n[352] I do not accept Fair Change’s submission. Simply demonstrating that LGBTQ persons are \\noverrepresented among homeless persons is insufficient to demonstrate that the Act has a \\ndisproportionate impact on members of that protected group. \\n[353] Fair Change asks the court to infer from the fact that LGBTQ persons are overrepresented \\namong homeless persons that they are also overrepresented among those who panhandle \\nIn its factum, the applicant writes that “LGBTQ persons are overrepresented among the \\nhomeless and, by implication, those who panhandle” [emphasis added]. From there, Fair \\nChange asks me to infer that the law has an unequal impact on them. Fair Change has not \\npresented evidence to justify these inferences.  \\n[354] There is no evidence in the record that LGBTQ persons are more likely to engage in \\nsoliciting or soliciting that is captured by the Act. There is no evidence that LGBTQ \\npersons are charged with violating the Act at a disproportionate rate. Indeed, although Dr. \\nO’Grady’s study “Can I see your ID?” identified the proportion of the survey respondents \\nwho self-identified as LGBTQ, it contained no data on how many of them received tickets. \\n[355] It is important to recall that, at Step One, causation is the central issue. The court must \\ndistinguish between adverse impacts caused or contributed to by the impugned law and \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 84 \\n \\n \\nthose that exist independently of it.248 With respect to LGBTQ persons, however, the \\nevidence does not amount to more than a web of instinct.249 \\n[356] I find that Fair Change has not proven that the Act creates or contributes to a \\ndisproportionate impact on LGBTQ persons. \\nIndividuals in receipt of social assistance \\n[357] Fair Change submits that the Act “contributes to a disproportionate impact on…individuals \\nin receipt of social assistance.” Based on the Court of Appeal’s decision in Falkiner, I \\naccept that receipt of social assistance is a personal characteristic analogous to a ground \\nprotected by s. 15 of the Charter.250 \\n[358] The Income Security Advocacy Centre submits that the court must adopt “an intersectional \\nlens focussing on the analogous ground of receipt of social assistance and mental \\ndisability.” I accept that people may experience many different types of inequalities that \\nwork together to limit their opportunities and increase disadvantage. Even if I apply an \\nintersectional lens to the evidence before me, Fair change has not met the test at Step One \\nfor individuals in receipt of social assistance.  \\n[359] Falkiner concerned a challenge to the definition of spouse in the Family Benefits Act.251 \\nBetween 1987 and 1995, the definition of “spouse” in the regulations under the Family \\nBenefits Act mirrored the definition of “spouse” under the Family Law Act.252 Persons were \\ndeemed to be spouses if they had lived together continuously for at least three years. In \\n1995, the definition of spouse in a regulation under the Family Benefits Act was \\namended.253 The amendment defined spouse to include persons of the opposite sex living \\nin the same place who had “a mutual agreement or arrangement regarding their financial \\naffairs” and a relationship that amounted to cohabitation. Under this amended definition, \\nonce persons of the opposite sex began living together, they were presumed to be spouses \\nunless they provided evidence to the contrary. \\n[360] Each of the claimants in Falkiner was an unmarried woman with one or more dependent \\nchildren and was in a “try on” relationship with a man with whom she had lived for less \\nthan a year. Each claimant had received social assistance until the 1995 definition of \\n“spouse” came into effect, whereupon the Director of the Income Maintenance Branch of \\nthe Ministry of Community and Social Services reclassified each respondent as a spouse, \\nand each respondent lost her eligibility to receive family benefits as a “sole support parent.” \\n                                                 \\n \\n248 Symes, at p. 765; Sharma, at para. 44. \\n249 Kahkewistahaw, at para. 34. \\n250 Falkiner v. Ontario (Ministry of Community and Social Services) (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at pp. 503-\\n504. \\n251 R.S.O. 1990, c. F.2. \\n252 R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3. \\n253 R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 366, s. 1(1)(d). \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 85 \\n \\n \\n[361] The Court of Appeal accepted that the claimants had been treated unequally on the basis \\nof the personal characteristic of being a social assistance recipient: \\nFirst, the respondents allege that they have been treated unequally \\non the basis of the personal characteristic of being a social assistance \\nrecipient. As I stated above, the respondents urge a comparison \\nbetween themselves and persons who are not on social assistance. \\nIn my view, the respondents’ claim of differential treatment on the \\nbasis of being a social assistance recipient can best be assessed by \\ncomparing their treatment to the treatment of single persons not on \\nsocial assistance. Framing the comparison in this way shows that the \\nrespondents have been treated unequally. They have suffered \\nadverse state-imposed financial consequences because they began \\nliving in try-on relationships. By contrast, single people who are not \\non social assistance are free to have these relationships without \\nattracting any kind of state-imposed financial consequences. These \\nadverse consequences visited on the respondents represent one \\naspect of the differential treatment they have received.254 \\n[362] As noted, neither Fair Change nor the Income Security Advocacy Centre has identified a \\ncomparison group. \\n[363] Fair Change makes the following submissions in support of its argument that the Act has \\na disproportionate impact on persons in receipt of social assistance:  \\nAt the first step of the s. 15 test: the enforcement of ss. 2, 3, and 5 \\nof the SSA contributes to a disproportionate impact on…individuals \\nin receipt of social assistance …. These groups are all significantly \\noverrepresented among the population of individuals who \\npanhandle….While there are no statistics showing that, when \\nenforcing \\nthe \\nSSA, \\nthe \\npolice \\ndisproportionately \\ntargets…individuals on social assistance …identical treatment by \\npolice officers and courts of individuals who panhandle has an \\nunequal impact on these groups because of their overrepresentation. \\n[364] Fair Change points to the following evidence in support of its submission that the Act has \\na disproportionate impact on individuals on social assistance: \\nSecond, panhandling is linked to the receipt of social assistance. Dr. \\nStapleton, an expert on social assistance in Ontario, notes that social \\nassistance rates are inadequate to cover recipients’ basic needs. \\nRecipients thus turn to panhandling to pay for food, alcohol/drug \\nhabits, or housing.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n254 Falkiner, at pp. 503-504. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 86 \\n \\n \\n[365] Dr. Stapleton’s opinion reads as follows: \\n22. \\nIn my own experience, a significant proportion of those who \\npanhandle receive social assistance. I am aware that the 2007 \\nPanhandling Pilot Project conducted by the City of Toronto found \\nthat of the 233 individuals who panhandled and who were surveyed, \\n44% received social assistance. I am also aware of emerging data \\nfrom a study in Windsor where 29 out of 34 panhandling individuals \\nsurveyed were recipients of social assistance, and the other 5 \\nindividuals surveyed expressed interest in accessing social \\nassistance or had received it in the past. In general, there is limited \\ndata available on income sources for panhandlers in Ontario. \\n23. \\nSome social assistance recipients turned to panhandling as a \\nway to survive because current social assistance rates are so low. \\n[366] However, the cross-examination of Dr. Stapleton demonstrated the frailty of the evidence \\nhe relied on in support of his opinion. First, he candidly admitted that the Panhandling Pilot \\nProject surveyed 233 people who panhandled. The study revealed that 44% of those \\nindividuals received social assistance. Dr. Stapleton acknowledged that the report \\nconcerned people who were legally panhandling, not those who solicited in a manner \\nprohibited by the Act. The study stated: \\nA distinction is made between legal panhandling and illegal or \\naggressive panhandling. People who panhandle in a legal manner \\nare the focus of this report, and the proposed enhanced street \\noutreach service is designed to respond to their needs. Illegal \\npanhandling, which is defined as either being aggressive or to a \\ncaptive audience, as defined in the Safe Streets Act, is the purview \\nof the Toronto Police Service, who enforces the Safe Streets Act. \\nUnless otherwise noted the act of panhandling referenced in this \\nreport is assumed to be legal, and not in violation of the Safe Streets \\nAct ... \"255 \\n[367] Dr. Stapleton acknowledged that the study stated that all 233 persons in the study \\npanhandled legally, there was no way to know how many of the individuals were \\npanhandling illegally, and there was no way to know if any of the 233 persons received \\ntickets under the Act. I find that this study provides no support for Fair Change’s \\nsubmissions.  \\n[368] Second, Dr. Stapleton’s affidavit did not provide a citation for the Windsor study to which \\nhe referred in his affidavit. The only information provided about the Windsor study is \\nreproduced above. I give no weight to this evidence as I am completely unable to evaluate \\n                                                 \\n \\n255 Toronto, Enhancing Streets to Homes Service to Address the Needs of People Who Are Street Involved, Including \\nThose Who Panhandle, Staff Report to the Executive Committee (April 21, 2008), at p. 4.  \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 87 \\n \\n \\nthe parameters of the study or to assess its utility to the question before me. There is no \\nway to know, for example, if any of the 34 individuals surveyed had ever received a ticket \\nunder the Act.  \\n[369] I find that Fair Change has not proven that the Act creates or contributes to a \\ndisproportionate impact on persons in receipt of social assistance. \\nIndividuals with mental health illnesses and addictions \\n[370] Fair Change makes the following submission in support of its argument that the Act has a \\ndisproportionate impact on persons with mental health illnesses and addictions:  \\nAt the first step of the s. 15 test: the enforcement of ss. 2, 3, and 5 \\nof the SSA contributes to a disproportionate impact on individuals \\nwith mental health illnesses and addictions…. These groups are all \\nsignificantly overrepresented among the population of individuals \\nwho panhandle….While there are no statistics showing that, when \\nenforcing the SSA, the police disproportionately targets individuals \\nwith mental health and addiction issues …identical treatment by \\npolice officers and courts of individuals who panhandle has an \\nunequal impact on these groups because of their overrepresentation. \\n[371] Fair Change did not specify the relevant comparator group and summarizes the evidence \\nin support of its submission as follows: \\nAdditionally, some groups of individuals who panhandle are \\ndirectly targeted by the SSA or in its enforcement. For example, \\nindividuals with addiction issues are targeted by s. 2(3)(5), which \\ndeems solicitation while intoxicated by alcohol or drugs to be \\naggressive. Similarly, individuals with mental health illnesses that \\ncause involuntary offensive utterances, such as Tourette syndrome, \\nare targeted by s. 2(3)(1). More generally, according to Dr. Kidd, \\nmany of the behaviours that attend mental illness and addiction, \\nsuch as impulsivity, social skill challenges, talking more loudly than \\nexpected, engaging as old friends with people they haven’t met \\nbefore, or standing more closely to an individual, could be \\nconsidered offences under the SSA, because they can be interpreted \\nas aggressive in the context of social engagement. The evidence of \\nMr. Williams, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Dunbar confirms that their \\nmental illnesses or addictions have directly led to many of their SSA \\ntickets. Finally, Dr. Kidd also opines that it is more likely that \\nhomeless individuals with mental health problems and addictions \\nwill be stereotyped as aggressive and will face higher levels of \\npolice surveillance – the same may be said more generally of all \\nother visibly homeless individuals who panhandle (which would \\nresult in a further unequal impact on overrepresented groups). \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 88 \\n \\n \\n[372] I will deal first with Fair Change’s submissions that “individuals with addiction issues are \\ntargeted by s. 2(3)(5), which deems solicitation while intoxicated by alcohol or drugs to be \\naggressive.” As explained above, I have found that s. 2(3)5 is unconstitutional because it \\nviolates the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d) of the Charter, the right to freedom of \\nexpression in s. 2(b) of the Charter, and in neither case is that infringement justified under \\ns. 1 of the Charter.  \\n[373] In my view, it is preferable to deal with the constitutionality of s. 2(3)5 under those other \\nprovisions. I do not believe I have the record before me to assess whether or not s. 2(3)5 \\ninfringes s. 15 of the Charter. I also do not think I have received complete submissions on \\nthe complex issues raised by the regulation of activity while intoxicated. There are statutory \\nrestrictions on engaging in many activities while intoxicated. For example, driving under \\nthe influence of alcohol is prohibited by s. 320.14 of the Criminal Code. In addition, it is a \\nprovincial offence to be intoxicated in a public place.256 In my view, this is not an \\nappropriate case to consider the constitutionality of s. 2(3)5 under s. 15 of the Charter, as \\nit is unnecessary to do so.  \\n[374] As can be seen, Fair Change primarily relies on the affidavit of Dr. Kidd, a clinical \\npsychologist. In his affidavit, Dr. Kidd provided his opinion that homeless individuals with \\nmental health challenges face frequent charges under Act and that it is highly likely that \\npersons living with mental illness or addiction are disproportionately ticketed under the \\nAct. His opinion contained the following: \\n12. \\nA number of studies confirm that homeless individuals with \\nmental illnesses face frequent charges under the SSA. … \\n13. \\nThere is further evidence to suggest a high rate of charges \\nfor minor, nonviolent crimes (in which category the SSA terms are \\nrelevant) accrued by homeless individuals with severe mental illness \\n(in the literature such charges are variably referred to as nuisance, \\nminor, non-violent, or misdemeanor depending on the source and \\nlocation of the information). A systematic review has found that \\namong such individuals the rate of one or more nonviolent/ \\nsummary charges ranges from 52-80% across representative studies. \\n14. \\nA large study of Canadian homeless individuals with severe \\nmental illnesses identified a proportion of 12% who experience \\nfrequent arrests for non-violent offenses such as those within the \\n                                                 \\n \\n256 Liquor Licence and Control Act, 2019, S.O. 2019, c. 15, Sched. 22, s. 31(1), which provides that \\n31 (1) No person shall be in an intoxicated condition in, \\n(a) a place to which the general public is invited or permitted access; or \\n(b) any part of a residence that is used in common by persons occupying more than one dwelling in the \\nresidence. \\n(2) A police officer or conservation officer may arrest without warrant any person who is contravening subsection \\n(1) if, in the opinion of the officer, it is necessary to do so for the safety of any person. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 89 \\n \\n \\nSSA (particularly for individuals with depression and addictions) \\nwith a larger proportion experiencing non-violent offence arrests \\nalong with arrests for more serious offences. \\n15. \\nWhile there is no direct study to indicate that Indigenous \\nstatus or mental illness and addictions are causes of disproportionate \\nticketing under the SSA, it is highly likely that disproportionate \\nticketing is occurring under this act and more broadly for the types \\nof offences it addresses. \\n[375] As discussed above, Dr. Kidd’s affidavit did not contain any citations or references. \\nInstead, it listed seven studies or articles that he consulted when preparing his opinion. On \\ncross-examination, Dr. Kidd admitted that none of the studies or articles that he consulted \\ndiscussed the enforcement of the Act, including enforcement against persons with \\ndisabilities, mental illnesses, or addictions. Dr Kidd acknowledged that none of the studies \\nhe consulted included any statistics about:  \\na. the proportion of individuals receiving tickets under the Act that had a mental \\nillness; \\nb. the proportion of homeless individuals in Ontario that had a mental illness; \\nc. the proportion of homeless individuals in Ontario that have an addiction; or \\nd. the types of behaviour that are captured by the Act; \\n[376] Dr. Kidd also conceded that the study from which he obtained the data in the last sentence \\nof paragraph 13 (“A systematic review has found that among such individuals the rate of \\none or more nonviolent/ summary charges ranges from 52-80% across representative \\nstudies”) involved 21 studies, none of which were conducted in Canada. \\n[377] While I accept that it will not always be necessary to have statistical evidence to support a \\ns. 15 argument, from what I can tell, Dr. Kidd had no evidence or data before him that drew \\na direct link between the Act and persons with a mental illness or shed any light on the \\nquestion of how the Act is enforced in Ontario in cases involving persons with disabilities \\nor mental illnesses.  \\n[378] Fair Change also relies on Dr. Kidd’s opinion that the behaviours that attend mental illness \\nand addiction “would be considered offences under the [Act].” Dr. Kidd reached this \\nopinion without relying on any studies that addressed the Act or how it is enforced in \\nOntario. He did not grapple with the meaning of “reasonable” in the definition of \\naggressive solicitation. Dr. Kidd’s opinion that persons with mental health problems will \\nface higher levels of police surveillance relates only to the administration of the Act, not \\nthe constitutionality of its provisions.  \\n[379] In these circumstances, I place no weight on Dr. Kidd’s opinion. He has offered opinions \\nthat are not anchored in the academic literature that he reviewed. I am unable to verify or \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 90 \\n \\n \\nassess the reliability of the opinions he has offered. Dr. Kidd is asking the court to “trust \\nme” contrary to the guidance in Abbey #2.257  \\n[380] I also do not think that the affidavit evidence of Mr. Roberts or Mr. Dunbar is sufficient to \\ndemonstrate that the Act has a disproportionate impact on individuals with mental illnesses \\nor addictions. I accept that their evidence establishes that each of them is living with mental \\nillness and have, at times, been addicted to drugs and or alcohol. \\n[381] Mr. Roberts’ affidavit states that he has been convicted of 434 offences under the \\nProvincial Offences Act. Of those 434 offences, 85 (or 19.6%) related to violations of the \\nAct. Mr. Roberts’ affidavit also states that his 434 convictions resulted in $64,876.25 in \\nfines. Of that amount $8913 (or 13.7%) related to fines for violations of the Act. Mr. \\nRoberts’ conduct appears to implicate a range of regulatory prohibitions well beyond those \\ncontained in the Act. \\n[382] In Mr. Dunbar’s case, it appears that his offending is primarily under the Act. Mr. Dunbar’s \\nevidence is that between 2003 and 2015, he had been convicted of approximately 350 \\noffences and that he currently owed approximately $45,000 in fines. He states that “almost \\nall of these were Safe Streets Act tickets for panhandling.” His affidavit indicates that, with \\nthe help of Fair Change, he has successfully challenged some of the tickets he received and \\nthat both prosecutors and judges have withdrawn or dismissed the allegations against him: \\nWith the help of Fair Change Community Legal Clinic, I fought \\nsome of these tickets and stayed out of jail. When judges and \\nprosecutors drop my tickets it’s because they know I’ve been poor, \\nhomeless, addicted to drugs and I do community service at the Fred \\nVictor center. I have been helping at Fred Victor for years. I live \\nthere and clean-up the clinic during their drop-in hours. I am friends \\nwith the staff there and they help to keep me on track in my life. \\n[383] However, neither the evidence of Mr. Roberts nor Mr. Dunbar establishes that the Act \\ncreated or contributed to a disproportionate impact on a claimant group based on a \\nprotected ground. All laws, including the Act, are expected to impact individuals, including \\nmembers of protected groups like Mr. Roberts and Mr. Dunbar. It is not sufficient for Fair \\nChange simply to show, as it has through the affidavits of Mr. Dunbar and Mr. Roberts, \\nthat the law impacts groups of individuals protected by section 15. At Step One, causation \\nis the central issue, and it is important to distinguish between adverse impacts caused or \\ncontributed to by the impugned law and those that exist independently of it.258  \\n[384] As noted above, the causation analysis at Step One necessarily involves drawing a \\ncomparison between the claimant group and other groups, or the general population.259 Fair \\n                                                 \\n \\n257 Abbey #2, at para. 119. \\n258 Symes, at p. 765; Sharma, at para. 44. \\n259 Sharma, at para. 32, citing Andrews, at p. 164. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 91 \\n \\n \\nChange must prove on a balance of probabilities that the Act has a disproportionate impact \\non a protected group as compared to non-group members.260 It must do so by presenting \\nsufficient evidence to prove that the Act creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact \\non the basis of a protected ground.  \\n[385] I find that Fair Change has not proven that the Act creates or contributes to a \\ndisproportionate impact on persons with mental health illnesses and disabilities.  \\nIndigenous people \\n[386] Fair Changes submits that the enforcement of the Act contributes to a disproportionate \\nimpact on Indigenous people because they are significantly overrepresented among the \\npopulation of people who solicit. \\n[387] Fair Change filed the affidavit of Mr. Williams, who was born in Fort Albany First Nation \\nand stated that his entire family, including himself, were victims of the residential school \\nsystem. For the reasons explained above, I do not give any weight to Mr. Williams evidence \\nregarding his soliciting and proceedings under the Act because he was not made available \\nfor cross-examination. None of Fair Change’s other affiants indicated that they were an \\nindigenous person.  \\n[388] Fair Change summarizes its evidence this way: \\nIndigenous individuals are also over-represented among those \\nexperiencing homelessness and, by implication, those who \\npanhandle. In Toronto, for example, they make up 4.5% of the \\nToronto population and 16% of Toronto’s homeless population. \\nMore generally, 6.97% of the urban Indigenous population in \\nCanada – 1 in 15 – is homeless, as compared to a national average \\nof 0.78%. This means that urban Indigenous individuals are eight \\ntimes more likely to experience homelessness than non-Indigenous \\nindividuals. \\n[389] While I accept that Indigenous persons are overrepresented among those experiencing \\nhomelessness, that alone is insufficient to demonstrate that the Act causes or contributes to \\na disproportionate impact on a protected group.  \\n[390] Fair Change submits that “Interactions with the police traumatise panhandlers, particularly \\nIndigenous persons.” Even if this is true, it is a matter that is relevant to the administration \\nof the Act, not the constitutionality of its provisions. This evidence does not support Fair \\nChange’s submission that the Act has a disproportionate impact on Indigenous persons. \\n[391] Aboriginal Legal Services submits that the Act violates s. 15 of the Charter because it \\ncontributes to a disproportionate number of tickets being given to Indigenous people and, \\n                                                 \\n \\n260 Sharma, at para. 40. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 92 \\n \\n \\ntherefore, the operation of the law has a disproportionate impact on this group. I do not \\naccept this argument as it is unsupported by the evidence before me.  \\n[392] I note that Prof. O’Grady states in his opinion that: \\nThere is no doubt that many more Indigenous people are being \\nticketed in more recent years than was the case when the SSA was \\nfirst put into place and that Indigenous people are disproportionately \\ntargeted under the SSA. \\n[393] Prof. O’Grady did not provide a citation to the evidence that supported his opinion. It does \\nnot appear that any of the studies relied on by Prof. O’Grady contained any data regarding \\nIndigenous persons receiving tickets under the Act: \\na. In the study “Making Money: Exploring the Economy of Young Homeless \\nWorkers,” 29 persons identified as panhandlers, but none of them self-identified as \\nAboriginal or Métis. A further 39 individuals listed squeegeeing as their main \\nsource of income. Of that group, 3% identified as Aboriginal or Métis. This study \\ncontained no data on whether or not any of the participants in the study received a \\nticket under the Act.  \\nb. In “A Social and Economic Impact Study of the Ontario Safe Streets Act on \\nToronto Squeegee Workers”, the study surveyed 50 youths. The study did not \\ncontain any information or data about the race, ethnic origin, or Indigeneity of the \\nsurvey participants. \\nc. In “Can I see your ID?”, the study surveyed 244 homeless youth, 15% of whom \\nidentified as Aboriginal or Indigenous persons. That study concluded that 10% of \\nall youth surveyed received a ticket under the Act in the prior year, but Prof. \\nO’Grady conceded on cross-examination that there was no statistically significant \\nconnection between identifying as an Aboriginal or Indigenous person and \\nreceiving a ticket under the Act. \\nd. In “Tickets and More Tickets,” there were no data on Indigeneity and ticketing \\npractices. \\n[394] Prof. O’Grady’s opinion that that the enforcement of the Act has a disproportionate impact \\non Indigenous persons appears to be unsupported by the evidence he reviewed in the \\npreparation of his report. If there is a basis for his opinion, it is not in evidence before me. \\nFollowing the guidance of Abbey #2, I give no weight to Dr. O’Grady’s opinion.  \\n[395] The record does not contain any statistical evidence to support the submissions of Fair \\nChange and Aboriginal Legal Services that the Act has a disproportionate impact on \\nIndigenous persons. \\n[396] Aboriginal Legal Services submits that widespread negative stereotypes about Indigenous \\npeople, including that they are disorderly and engaged in criminal activity, make it more \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 93 \\n \\n \\nlikely that they will be perceived as aggressive and thus more likely to receive tickets for \\naggressive panhandling than non-Indigenous panhandlers. I do not accept this argument as \\nthere is no evidence in the record to support the submission that Indigenous persons are \\nmore likely to receive tickets than non-Indigenous persons engaging in the same type of \\nsolicitation. \\n[397] Finally, Aboriginal Legal Services submits that because convictions may be entered \\nwithout the accused appearing in court, the judicial officers imposing sanctions have no \\nopportunity to consider the Gladue factors.261 In my view, this argument is misplaced. As \\nset out above, the procedures for findings of guilt and sentencing are set out in the \\nProvincial Offences Act, not the Act. Fair Change did not challenge the constitutionality of \\nthe Provincial Offences Act. Moreover, any individual who wants to make submissions to \\nthe court regarding their guilt or innocence, or the appropriate sanction in all of the \\ncircumstances, is free to do so. \\n[398] I find that Fair Change has not proven that the Act creates or contributes to a \\ndisproportionate impact on Indigenous persons. \\nConclusion  \\n[399] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that Fair Change has failed to meet the burden at \\nStep One with respect to any of the claimant groups.  \\n[400] There is no reason to continue on to Step Two, and I decline to do so. \\n11. \\nRemedy \\n[401] Section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 mandates the striking down of any law that is \\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, but only “to the extent of the \\ninconsistency.” I have found that the entirety of:  \\na. paragraphs 2(3)2 to 2(3)(6) of the Act limit sections 2(b), 7, and 11(d) of the \\nCharter and those limitations are not justified under s. 1; and  \\nb. clauses 3(2)(a) to 3(2)(e) limit section 2(b) and those limitations are not justified \\nunder s. 1. \\n[402] Depending on the circumstances, a court may simply strike down, it may strike down and \\ntemporarily suspend the declaration of invalidity, or it may resort to the techniques of \\nreading down or reading in.262 For the reasons set out above in paragraphs [170] to [188], \\n                                                 \\n \\n261 R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688. \\n262 Schachter v. Canada, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, at p. 695. \\n2024 ONSC 1895 (CanLII)\\nPage: 94 \\n \\n \\nreading-in would not be an appropriate remedy. In my view, striking down the \\nunconstitutional provisions in the Act is the most appropriate remedy. \\n[403] Ontario did not suggest that a delayed declaration of invalidity was necessary to protect the \\nrule of law, public safety, or any reliance interests.263 \\n[404] Therefore, I declare that paragraphs 2(3)2 to 2(3)(6) and clauses 3(2)(a) to 3(2)(e) of the \\nAct are without force or effect, pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Charter. \\n12. \\nCosts \\n[405] If the parties are not able to resolve the costs of this application, Fair Change may email its \\ncosts submission of no more than three double-spaced pages to my judicial assistant on or \\nbefore April 9, 2024.

Lugano View Limited; \\n \\nBEFORE: \\nASSOCIATE JUSTICE C. WIEBE \\n \\nCOUNSEL: Dylan Dilks for Lugano View Limited; \\n \\nNicole Abergil for Bank-Strox Renovation Inc. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHEARD: \\nMarch 25, 2024.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nENDORSEMENT \\n \\n \\n[1]      Lugano View Limited (“Lugano”) seeks an order lifting a consent stay order and an order \\nunder old Construction Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30 (“CA”) section 47 discharging the subject claim for \\nlien and dismissing this action, all on account of delay.  \\nBackground \\n[2]      The following facts are not in dispute. Lugano, the owner, retained Bank-Strox Renovation \\nInc. (Bank-Strox) as general contractor on a balcony renovation project. Lugano terminated the \\ncontract on January 2, 2017. On March 13, 2017 Bank-Strox registered a claim for lien in the \\namount of $279,309.38. Lugano paid an amount to Bank-Strox.  \\n[3]      Bank-Strox commenced this lien action on April 21, 2017 claiming a lien of $238,095.96. \\nThis action was not defended as by November, 2017 the parties agreed to arbitrate the issues with \\nStephen Morrison. Other than the agreement to arbitrate, no other terms of the arbitration were \\nagreed upon.  \\n[4]      On September 6, 2017, a subcontractor to Bank-Strox, Royalguard Industries Incorporated \\n(“Royalguard”), registered a claim for lien. On October 6, 2017, Royalguard commenced its own lien \\naction naming Bank-Strox and Lugano as defendants. In its pleading, Lugano alleged that Bank-\\nStrox had abandoned the contract, delayed, caused deficiencies and not paid trades. The Royalguard \\nclaim was resolved in February, 2018 with a payment by Lugano to Royalguard that decreased the \\nBank-Strox claim accordingly. In the end, the Bank-Strox claim for lien was reduced to $215,621.27. \\n[5]      The arbitration did not take place. There were several email exchanges with Mr. Morrison \\nfrom November, 2017 to February, 2019. During this time, the parties also discussed settlement. On \\nFebruary 11, 2019 Bank-Strox delivered a Statement of Position concerning the arbitration. There \\n2024 ONSC 1901 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nwas no responding statement from Lugano. On February 13, 2019, Mr. Morrison circulated a \\nretainer agreement for the arbitration. It was not executed by either side.  \\n[6]      Due to the looming end of the two-year period under CA section 37, the parties obtained a \\nconsent order from Master Robinson (as he then was) on April 1, 2019 deeming the order an order \\nfor trial for the purpose of section 37. The order also stayed this action to facilitate the arbitration \\nand authorized the parties to move for further directions from the court and to lift the stay.  \\n[7]      Bank-Strox then hired a new lawyer, Roy Wise. It began working on an arbitration brief and \\nan affidavit of documents. In December, 2019 Mr. Wise suggested to Michael Swartz, counsel for \\nLugano, through emails that a less expensive arbitrator be chosen or that the matter be returned to \\nthe court. Mr. Swartz rejected both suggestions reaffirming Lugano’s desire to arbitrate with Mr. \\nMorrison. There was then no activity in 2020 and 2021.  \\n[8]      In February, 2022, Bank-Strox hired its present lawyers. However, again, nothing happened. \\nOn May 30, 2023 Mr. Swartz sent a letter advising that Lugano had decided to bring this motion. He \\nenclosed a notice of motion for a date to be determined. Again, nothing happened. On September \\n20, 2024 Mr. Dilks emailed threatening that Lugano would schedule the motion if Bank-Strox did \\nnot advise by September 29, 2022 that it intended to move forward with the arbitration. That \\ndeadline passed without a response. On October 27, 2023 Ms. Abergil emailed advising that the \\nprincipal of Bank-Strox had been ill and unable to give instructions in 2022. She advised that Bank-\\nStrox would resist the motion. Lugano scheduled this motion in November, 2023. \\nDelay \\n[9]      It is undisputed that the old CA applies. There was some discussion as to whether leave \\nunder CA section 67(2) is necessary. This is the subsection that requires consent of the court for \\ninterlocutory steps not provided for in the CA. In my view, no such leave is required. Concerning \\nthe stay motion, the consent stay order expressly authorized a motion to lift the stay. The remainder \\nof the motion is brought under CA section 47 which does not require leave. \\n[10]      Concerning the delay issue, there is no issue as to a delay in the lien action as the parties \\nsuspended that action in November, 2017 when they agreed to arbitrate and then later obtained a \\nconsent stay of that action to facilitate the arbitration. Understandably, nothing has happened in the \\nlien action as a result. The question concerns the delay in the arbitration. Does it justify lifting the \\nstay and dismissing the action for delay? \\n[11]      Having considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I have decided to \\ndismiss the motion. Here are my reasons.  \\n[12]      The cornerstone of any analysis of motions for dismissal for delay is the principle that the \\nplaintiff bears the primary responsibility for the progress of an action and suffers the consequences \\nof a dilatory regard for the pace of the litigation; see M. Fuda Contracting Inc. v. 1291609 Ontario Ltd., \\n2018 ONSC 4663 (CanLII) at paragraph 31 and Wellwood v. Ontario Provincial Police, 2010 ONCA 386 \\n(CanLII) at paragraph 48. That principle makes sense for civil actions where the plaintiff is the one \\nwho commences the action and forces the defendant to incur the expense and inconvenience of a \\nresponse.  \\n2024 ONSC 1901 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[13]      In my view, this principle does not apply to an arbitration like the one in this case, where \\nboth parties together agree to arbitrate the case after the commencement of a civil action to perfect \\na lien. In these circumstances, the rules of contract interpretation apply and require that both parties \\nfulfil their contract obligations to each other in good faith and take the steps necessary to arbitrate \\nthe case. That means that the responsibility at minimum rests on both parties to progress the \\narbitration and that both parties suffer the consequences of failing to do so.  \\n[14]      But I go a step further. In a case, like this one, where the defendant fails even to plead, either \\nin the lien action or in the arbitration, the defendant bears a greater responsibility to move the \\narbitration forward. The defendant is the sole party that is aware of all of the issues that will drive \\nthe case and has not disclosed this knowledge and information on the record. The agreement to \\narbitrate and the eventual consent stay order act as a shield protecting the defendant from the \\nadverse consequences of not pleading, namely against being noted in default and all the \\nconsequences in a lien action that flow from that. That means, in my view, that the defendant bears \\nthe greater responsibility to move the arbitration forward to allow for pleadings and the other \\nnecessary interlocutory steps.  \\n[15]      I take inspiration from the decision of Associate Justice Robinson in Nova Concrete Inc. v. \\n2035211 Ontario Inc., 2022 ONSC 2391 (CanLII). In this case, the plaintiff lien claimant had the \\ndefendant owner, a corporation, noted in default for failing to plead. Four years after the service of \\nthe statement of claim and the default and after an amalgamation, the owner brought a motion to \\ndeclare the lien expired and to dismiss the action for delay. The delay motion proceeded under CA \\nsection 47. His Honour denied that motion. He stated in paragraph 40 that while delay may be a \\n“proper ground” for a motion under section 47, the determination of that issue should be \\n“contextual, not static.” He described in paragraph 42 that the defendant’s failure to plead was a \\nfailure “of the most basic obligation in litigation.” He found in paragraph 43 that the owner’s failure \\nto plead for four years without an explanation rendered delay an improper ground for a dismissal \\norder in that case.  \\n[16]      Lugano is not disqualified from bringing a motion for a dismissal order under section 47 in \\nthis case on account of its failure to plead. This is due to the arbitration agreement in late 2017 \\nbefore pleadings closed in the lien action. However, I find that Lugano’s lack of pleading foisted on \\nit the greater responsibility to move the arbitration forward and to explain the delay.  \\n[17]      I note incidentally that the Lugano pleading in the Royalguard action suggests that Lugano \\nprobably has in mind a huge set-off and counterclaim against Bank-Strox concerning deficiency \\ncorrection costs, and contract abandonment and delay damages. Once pleaded, the Lugano pleading \\ncould therefore effectively make it the de facto “plaintiff” with the largest claim, thereby putting an \\nonus on it to explain the delay even under the traditional analysis of motions in civil actions for \\ndismissal for delay.  \\n[18]      Has Lugano explained its delay? No, it has not. The evidence shows that Lugano did \\nvirtually nothing to advance the arbitration once the arbitration agreement was in place in late 2017.  \\nIt consented to the stay order. It followed up with counsel for the plaintiff as to the status of the \\narbitration in May, 2023 and September, 2023. It then brought this motion. It did not bring a \\nmotion under the Arbitration Act, 1991, SO 1991, c 17 (“AA”), section 10. While the arbitration \\nagreement in this case may be no more than an oral one, that makes it no less a binding arbitration \\n2024 ONSC 1901 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nagreement; see AA section 5(3). AA section 10 is the section which specifies that, where there is an \\narbitration agreement with no process to appoint an arbitrator or where there is an arbitration \\nagreement with such a process that has not be activated, either party to an arbitration agreement can \\nmove before the court to get the court to appoint the arbitrator. Neither party disputed that section \\n10 would apply to this case. Once the arbitrator is appointed, the arbitrator has the power under the \\nAA to force the parties to plead and to deal with a delay in the arbitration; see AA section 27. \\nIndeed, in the stay order itself, Master Robinson (as he then was) invited the parties to apply to the \\ncourt for directions. Neither party took these steps, and neither party explained why that was not \\ndone.   \\n[19]      I note as well that, while there was evidence that Bank-Strox delivered a pleading in the \\narbitration and started preparing an affidavit of documents, Lugano did neither and had no \\nexplanation for not doing so other than to say that there was no arbitration agreement in place in \\nthis regard. This made an application under AA section 10 all the more imperative, and that did not \\nhappen. Lugano’s profound inaction is, in my view, fatal to this motion.  \\n[20]      Lugano argued that it has been prejudiced by the Bank-Strox delay. There is authority for the \\nproposition that the mere existence of the claim for lien is prejudicial to the owner; see Southwestern \\nSales Corporation Limited v. Spurr Bros. Ltd., 2016 ONCA 590 (CanLII) at paragraph 16. However, \\nthere was no evidence of actual prejudice on account of this delay, such as the interruption of a \\nrefinancing or a sale. In that event, Lugano no doubt would have been able to move under CA \\nsection 44 to vacate the claim for lien with security. It has not done so to date. In any event, if there \\nwas actual prejudice, Lugano is, for the reasons already discussed, in part if not primarily to blame \\nfor it.  \\n[21]      I note as well that there is no evidence that a fair trial hearing in this case cannot not take \\nplace despite the delay. There was no evidence of a loss of key witnesses or key documents. While \\nmemories may have faded, this case appears to be typical construction case where the documents \\nwill guide the process. \\n[22]      I have to comment on the position of Bank-Strox. While I am dismissing the Lugano \\nmotion, I am also not impressed with the conduct of Bank-Strox. It discussed settlement with \\nLugano up to the time of the stay order. Then, with new counsel, it appears to have gotten “cold \\nfeet” about the arbitration with Mr. Morrison due to the expense. Lugano nevertheless insisted on \\nstaying with Mr. Morrison. Bank-Strox then did nothing and did nothing for over two years. In the \\nmotion material, Bank-Strox’s principal, Martin Bankov, in his affidavit tried to explain this delay on \\nthe Covid-19 pandemic and its adverse effects on Bank-Strox’s business. There was no \\ncorroboration for this bald statement. The pandemic might explain a delay of a few months, but not \\none of over two years.  \\n[23]      Then there was the hiring of Bank-Strox’s present counsel in February, 2022; but then there \\nwas again no activity by Bank-Strox for 1.5 years. Mr. Bankov tried to explain this delay on his \\nmedical condition; but there was no medical corroboration for that position. This was indeed a poor \\nresponse to this motion. While I will not change my decision due to this poor response, it will have \\nan affect on my costs decision. \\nConclusion \\n2024 ONSC 1901 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[24]      For these reasons, I dismiss the motion in its entirety.  \\n[25]      As for costs, both sides filed costs outlines. Lugano filed a costs outline that shows \\n$24,887.47 in partial indemnity costs, $37,294.19 in substantial indemnity costs and $41,429.77 in \\nactual costs. Bank-Strox filed a costs outline that shows $8,681.45 in partial indemnity costs, \\n$12,298.73 in substantial indemnity costs and $14,469.09 in actual costs.  \\n[26]      I believe I have enough to make an order as to costs of this motion. It is highly unlikely that \\nmeaningful offers were served given the issues.  \\n[27]      I am not prepared to award either party costs in this motion. Lugano was not successful and, \\ntherefore, should not be awarded costs. Bank-Strox’s response to this motion was poor as described \\nabove, and, therefore, does not deserve costs. Therefore, I award no costs of this motion. Both \\nparties must absorb their own costs.  \\n \\nDATE: April 2, 2024  \\n \\n \\n \\n_____________________________ \\nASSOCIATE JUSTICE C.

Metamore Inc., 2024 ONSC 1902  \\nCOURT FILE NO.:  CV-23-00000043-0000  \\nDATE:  04/02/2024  \\nSUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE - ONTARIO  \\nRE: \\nJeyakumar Subramaniam and J K Eats & Pub Inc. \\nApplicants  \\nAND  \\nMetamore Inc.  \\nRespondent  \\nBEFORE:  \\nMadam Justice K. McVey   \\nCOUNSEL: Noel Gerry, for the Applicants  \\nMark Pedersen, for the Respondent  \\nHEARD:   \\nIn writing  \\nCOSTS DECISION  \\n[1] The Applicants seek costs of $31,333.09 on a substantial indemnity basis after securing the \\nreinstatement of their commercial tenancy on the basis that the Respondent did not comply with \\nsection 19(2) of the Commercial Tenancies Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7 (“CTA”): Subramaniam v \\nMetamore Inc., 2024 ONSC 1189. \\nPositions of the Parties  \\n[2] \\nThe Applicants argue that, at minimum, it was apparent that a reviewing court would grant \\nrelief from forfeiture given that the Respondent’s termination of the lease was overtly \\ndisproportional to the nature of the alleged breach. As such, they argue that the Respondent acted \\nunreasonably in failing to settle the litigation at an early stage after counsel for the Applicants first \\n2024 ONSC 1902 (CanLII)\\n~ 2 ~  \\n  \\n \\nreached out to the Respondent via letter on September 11, 2023, seeking to resolve the differences \\nbetween the parties. Second, the Applicants emphasize that they made an offer to settle that closely \\nresembled the relief they ultimately obtained, and that neither offer made by the Respondent \\nincluded reinstatement of the lease despite the equities clearly lying in favor of it. Finally, the \\nApplicants suggest that substantial indemnity costs are appropriate given the reprehensible and \\nhigh-handed conduct of the Respondent during the breakdown of the parties’ commercial \\nrelationship.   \\n[3] \\nThe Respondent asserts that the Court should deny the Applicants their costs because they \\nserved only a Costs Outline and not a Bill of Costs as required by the Rules of Civil Procedure, \\nR.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 (the “Rules”), rendering this Court unable to assess the reasonableness of \\nthe Applicants’ efforts on the file. Second, the Respondent argues that the costs advanced by the \\nApplicants are excessive when compared to its own Bill of Costs. Third, the Respondent claims \\nthat the Applicants were only partially successful on the application because they did not secure \\npunitive damages. Finally, the Respondent argues that the Applicants unnecessarily lengthened \\nand complicated the proceedings when tendering an affidavit and annexed business plan from Yogi \\nPararajasingam, a Chartered Professional Accountant, in support of a claim for lost revenue, which \\nthe Applicants later abandoned.   \\n[4] \\nI agree with the Respondent that the Applicants ought to have provided a Bill of Costs as \\nper the Rules. However, this does not necessarily disentitle the Applicants to their costs. No cases \\nwere provided by the Respondent in support of that rather extreme result given that the Applicants \\nwere the successful party. I agree, however, that I must address costs cautiously and conservatively \\ngiven the lack of detailed breakdown in the Applicants’ Costs Outline.   \\nScale of Costs   \\n[5] \\nElevated costs may be warranted where the unsuccessful party has engaged in conduct that \\nis reprehensible, scandalous, or outrageous: Davies v Clarington (Municipality), 2009 ONCA \\n2722, at para. 28. Substantial indemnity costs are appropriate “in rare and exceptional cases to \\nmark the disapproval of the conduct of the party in the litigation”: Hunt v TD Securities Inc. (2003), \\n66 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 123. Conduct triggering elevated costs may encompass not only \\n2024 ONSC 1902 (CanLII)\\n~ 3 ~  \\n  \\n \\nbehavior during litigation, but also conduct giving rise to litigation: Mortimer v Cameron (1994), \\n17 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at p. 23, as cited in Mars Canada Inc. v. Bemco Cash & Carry Inc., 2018 \\nONCA 239, at para. 43.   \\n[6] \\nIn my view, the conduct of the Respondent is worthy of judicial rebuke and ought to trigger \\nan elevated costs award. The Respondent was an experienced commercial landlord during its \\ndealings with the Applicants. Agents for the Respondent unjustifiably locked the Applicants out \\nof the property on the verge of their opening day. Despite Mr. Subramaniam’s collaborative and \\ncooperative attitude towards the alleged breach, agents for the Respondent treated him with \\naggression and disrespect. Agents for the Respondent turned the power off at the property, \\nknowing that doing so jeopardized the Applicants’ food inventory. Agents for the Respondent used \\nthis as leverage to force Mr. Subramaniam out of the restaurant despite his status as a rent-paying \\ntenant who had been afforded none of the protections set out in the CTA. Agents for the Respondent \\nrepeatedly threatened to involve the police, and ultimately did. The intimidatory behavior by \\nagents of the Respondent culminated in them intentionally smashing a case of beer on the floor \\nwhen interacting with Mr. Subramaniam. As I indicated in my reasons dated February 26, 2024, \\nthe conduct of the Respondent was outrageous and reprehensible.   \\n[7] \\nI have no hesitation concluding that the Applicants are entitled to costs on a substantial \\nindemnity basis.   \\nQuantum of Costs  \\n[8] \\nCosts are quintessentially discretionary: Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. \\n131(1); Restoule v Canada (Attorney General), 2021 ONCA 779, at para. 344. Costs are \\nintended to foster a number of fundamental purposes: 1) indemnify the successful party of \\nthe legal costs they incurred; 2) encourage settlement; 3) deter frivolous actions and \\ndefences; and 4) discourage unnecessary steps that unduly prolong the litigation: 1465778 \\nOntario Inc. v. 1122077 Ontario Ltd. (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 757 (C.A.).   \\n[9] \\nRule 57.01(1) of the Rules delineates factors the court may consider when determining an \\nappropriate amount of costs. Ultimately, the costs fixed by the Court “should reflect more \\nwhat the court views as a fair and reasonable amount that should be paid by the \\n2024 ONSC 1902 (CanLII)\\n~ 4 ~  \\n  \\n \\nunsuccessful parties rather than any exact measure of the actual costs to the successful \\nlitigant”: Boucher v Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario (2004), 71 \\nO.R. (3d) 281 (C.A.), at para. 24. The overall objective of fixing costs is to fix an amount \\nthat is objectively reasonable, fair, and proportionate for the unsuccessful party to pay in \\nthe circumstances of the case: Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly Canada Inc., 2022 ONCA 587, at \\npara. 61.  \\n[10] \\nFirst, I conclude that the time spent by the Applicants’ counsel was reasonable. Counsel \\nfor the Respondent spent 54.2 hours on the file as per its Bill of Costs. This is similar to \\nthe 60.45 total hours spent by counsel for the Applicants, who bore the onus and the tactical \\nresponsibility of putting together a convincing record. The discrepancy between the \\namounts claimed by the parties is a function of the relative experience levels of counsel \\nand their corresponding hourly billing rate, not the time spent on the file.   \\n[11] \\nSecond, the issues in the litigation were significant. The Applicants had invested close to \\n$200,000 in the restaurant before they were unlawfully locked out of the property the day \\nbefore their restaurant was scheduled to open.   \\n[12] \\nThird, the Applicants were wholly successful on the Application.   \\n[13] \\nFourth, I find the offer to settle extended by the Applicants in January 2024 was reasonable \\nand, in substance, closely mirrored the relief they ultimately secured. The Applicants \\nextended a total of three offers to settle at various stages of the litigation. On September \\n19, 2023, while making it plain that the Applicants’ primary desire was to see their lease \\nreinstated, the Applicants offered to settle the matter with a lump sum payment of $193,000 \\nto account for their lost investment. In January 2024, the Applicants made two further \\noffers. The first offer had the Respondent reinstating the tenancy and paying damages in \\nthe amount of $25,000. In the alternative, the Applicants offered to settle with a lump sum \\npayment of $212,000.   \\n[14] \\nThe Respondent made two offers to settle. Neither contemplated the restoration of the \\nApplicants’ tenancy nor did they account for the Applicants’ financial losses. The first \\nproposal had the Applicants retrieving their chattels from the property, and then parting \\n2024 ONSC 1902 (CanLII)\\n~ 5 ~  \\n  \\n \\nways with the Respondent. The second proposal offered the Applicants $20,000 in \\nconsideration for their chattels, chattels the Applicants purchased for $80,000 just a few \\nmonths prior. Neither offer came anywhere close to addressing the financial impact unfairly \\noccasioned to the Applicants by the disproportionate and unlawful termination of their \\nlease.   \\n[15] \\nFifth, I have considered the unnecessary effort expended on the litigation by the \\nintroduction of the business plan completed by Mr. Pararajasingam. This necessitated \\ncounsel for the Respondent preparing for and attending a 45-minute cross-examination \\nbefore the specific claim was abandoned by the Applicants. I am not prepared to \\ncompensate the Applicants for the costs associated with this aspect of the litigation. \\nQuantifying this amount is difficult given that the Applicants did not file an itemized Bill \\nof Costs. I note, however, that the business plan did not feature prominently in the \\nApplicants’ claim and was relatively brief (approximately 20 pages).   \\nConclusion  \\n[16] \\nThe Applicants are entitled to costs on a substantial indemnity basis. In my view, fixing \\ncosts at $25,000 is fair, reasonable and ought to have fallen within the Respondent’s reasonable \\nexpectations given the nature and complexity of the proceedings and its conduct during the dispute.   \\n[17] \\nAccordingly, I fix costs of the application at $25,000, all inclusive, payable by the \\nRespondent to the Applicants within 30 days.   \\n \\nMadam Justice K.

Quigley J. \\nReasons For Sentence \\n \\n1. Introduction \\n[1] \\nOn January 31, 2023, Chaves Patten and Rushsean James were convicted by a jury \\nof the violent armed home invasion robbery of a residence in Etobicoke, in north-west \\nToronto. The house was in an upscale residential neighborhood, on the streetcorner of \\nPersimmon Court and Lafferty Street. Mr. Rainer Fernando lived there but the residence \\nbelonged to Mr. Fernando’s parents.  \\n[2] \\nInitially, four co-accused were charged jointly: (i) these two accused; Chaves \\nPatten and Rushsean James, and (ii) two other individuals; Ohaje Taitt, and Emma Hinch. \\nThe four of them were charged with conspiring together and committing this armed \\nrobbery at the residence of the complainant, Mr. Fernando, on March 10, 2020.  \\n[3] \\nMr. Taitt pled guilty after the preliminary inquiry and prior to trial. He was \\nsentenced to a penitentiary term of seven years. Sadly, Ms. Hinch passed away after the \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\npreliminary inquiry but before trial, likely from a drug overdose. Only these two accused \\nproceeded to trial.  \\n[4] \\nThe jury found Mr. Patten guilty of seven offences. Mr. James was found guilty of \\nfour offences. At this sentencing hearing, both Mr. Patten and Mr. James were arraigned \\non a separate indictment, to which it was agreed the evidence from trial would apply. \\nOn that basis, in addition to the jury’s findings, I found Mr. Patten guilty of seven \\nfurther Fail to Comply offences, and Mr. James guilty of one Fail to Comply offence.  \\n \\n[5] \\nIn the result, Mr. Chaves Patten is before this court to be sentenced for the \\nfollowing offences: \\n \\nCount \\nOffence \\nCriminal Code Section \\n2 \\nConspiracy to Commit Robbery \\n465(1) \\n4 \\nRobbery with a firearm. \\n344(1)(a.1) \\n5 \\nDischarge with Intent \\n244(2)(a)(i) \\n7 \\nPossession of a loaded prohibited or restricted firearm \\n95(2)(a) \\n8 \\nAssault causing Bodily Harm \\n267(b) \\n9 \\nDisguise with Intent \\n108(2)(a) \\n11 \\nOccupy a motor vehicle with a Firearm \\n94(2)(a) \\nFTC 1-2 \\nFail to Comply with Release – House Arrest (x 2) \\n117.01(1) \\nFTC 3-6 \\nFail to Comply with Release – Weapons (x4) \\n117.01(1) \\nFTC 7 \\nFail to Comply with Release – Curfew \\n117.01(1) \\n \\n[6] \\nMr. Rushsean James is before this court to be sentenced for the following offences: \\n \\nCount \\nOffence \\nCriminal Code Section \\n1 \\nConspiracy to Commit Robbery \\n465(1) \\n3 \\nRobbery with a firearm. \\n344(1)(a.1) \\n6 \\nPossession of a loaded prohibited or restricted firearm \\n95(2)(a) \\n10 \\nOccupy a motor vehicle with a Firearm \\n94(2)(a) \\nFTC 8 \\nFail to Comply with Weapons Prohibition \\n117.01(1) \\n \\n[7] \\nThe question before the court is the fit sentence in all the circumstances for each \\nof these offenders. \\n \\n2. Circumstances of the Offences \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[8] \\nStated simply, Mr. Fernando knew Ms. Hinch. She was there with him at his house \\nlate that evening as his guest, but unknown to him, she was the ‘insider’. Rushsean James \\nwas the driver of the getaway car. Chaves Patten and Ohaje Taitt were also in that car, \\nboth armed and masked. Mr. James drove them from Brampton to this specific location in \\nEtobicoke. Mr. Patten and Mr. Taitt exited Mr. James’ vehicle. Once Mr. Patten and Mr. \\nTaitt gained entry to the residence through Ms. Hinch, who waved them in while Mr. \\nFernando was taking a bathroom break, they violently pistol-whipped, and robbed Mr. \\nFernando. \\n[9] \\nAs this was happening, another vehicle, a BMW, drove up beside and fired shots \\nat Mr. James’ vehicle, the Chevy Cruz getaway car.  Mr. James barely missed being hit. \\nHe ran away from the scene as fast as he could in a southerly direction, as captured on \\none video surveillance camera. Ms. Hinch appeared to hide in a driveway north of the \\nFernando house off Lafferty Street, Mr. Patten fled the house, with Mr. Fernando chasing \\nhim. As he chased Mr. Patten out of the home, at the foot of the driveway Mr. Patten \\nturned pointed a firearm at him and fired, narrowly missing Mr. Fernando. Mr. Patten \\nthen fled on foot. Mr. Taitt secreted briefly in the house, and then while this was ongoing, \\nexited, got into the Porsche SUV in the driveway, and drove away. Another connected \\nseries of gunshots were fired down the road near Burnamthorpe Road, also involving the \\nPorsche  \\n[10] \\nPolice ultimately attended the scene and located numerous items belonging to \\nand/or identifying the accused, including a cell phone associated to Mr. Patten, as well as \\nMr. James’ glasses and identification on the ground beside his vehicle which he \\nabandoned. Some 16 empty shell casings were found on the driveway and the two streets \\nthat bordered the residence. There was video surveillance camera evidence from three \\ncameras around the house: one at the front door, one overlooking the driveway, and one \\noverlooking the backyard towards the street. The entire event is captured on video, except \\nfor the second or two of uncovered territory bordering Lafferty on the side of the \\nFernando house.  \\n3. Circumstances of the Offenders \\n[11] \\nEnhanced Pre-Sentence Reports (EPSR’s) were prepared by two very experienced \\nsocial welfare members of the Sentencing and Parole Project, Ms. M. Richards for Mr. \\nPatten, and Ms. J. Pemberton for Mr. James.  \\n(i) Chaves Patten: \\n[12] \\nMr. Patten is 27 years old and was born in Jamaica. He is the only child born to \\nDezeree McCallum-Patten and Glenrick Patten. Mr. Patten has an older sister born to his \\nmother’s previous relationship, and six older paternal siblings who reside in Jamaica. He \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nis a Black man of Jamaican ethnicity. He is the father of three children, a 7-year-old \\ndaughter and two sons ages 5 and 6. \\n[13] \\nHis mother, Ms. McCallum-Patten is 56 years old and was born and raised in \\nJamaica. When she was 25 years old, she married Glenrick Patten, a hard-working, kind-\\nhearted and well-respected man in their community. During the early years of their \\nmarriage, she worked in retail and Glenrick opened up the first of two restaurants. After \\nChavez was born when she was 29 years old, Glenrick opened the second restaurant. She \\nworked full-time by day and assisted in running the restaurants at night, and then after 10 \\nyears, left the retail sector and helped manage the restaurants full-time. \\n[14] \\nTheir family life was good. Sadly, Glenrick Patten died in November 2006 when \\nChavez was 10 years old. He had gone out on a brief errand and was killed in a terrible \\ncar accident. She and Chavez both cried and mourned, and Chavez also spent many years \\ndenying his father’s death. Their lives changed permanently.  \\n[15] \\nBefore his father died, Mr. Patten’s early years in Jamaica were very positive, but \\nthat ended following the death of his father: he said “it was very bad, he was my right \\nhand, I was always with him”. Greedy members of his father’s family wrestled control \\nover the businesses and money away from his mother. She became very concerned for \\ntheir safety, and they abandoned their home and fled that community within days after his \\ndeath. They lived with friends for a year, until her brother sponsored them to Canada. Ms. \\nMcCallum-Patten and Chavez arrived in Canada in September 1997, when he was 11 \\nyears old. \\n[16] \\nSettlement in Canada caused considerable hardship for many years. He was \\nhoping for a better life happy in Canada, but life as a new landed immigrant was more \\ndifficult than he anticipated. They settled initially with family members but were \\nmistreated and had to leave. They were “barely surviving” because his mother could not \\nfind work, even while those family members were demanding that she pay rent. \\n[17] \\nMs. McCallum-Patten worked in a series of rough jobs before she received \\nconfirmation of their immigration status. She was subjected to anti-Black racism that \\ncaused her, in one case, to leave a position after just one-day’s work. She was “treated \\nlike dirt” by the white staff and supervisors, while her white colleagues were treated with \\nrespect. Things started to stabilize when she started work as a caregiver. She began a \\nnursing and Personal Support Worker (PSW) program. She attended school by day and \\nworked at night for three years. Her work and school schedule left Chavez without \\nsupervision. \\n[18] \\nMr. Patten described his behaviours - poor school attendance and anger - as \\n“acting out”. He started getting into trouble and forming friendships with people who \\nwere “bad”. Mr. Patten believed that their lives would have been different had his father \\nnot died. He was angry about the state of their lives.  \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[19] \\nShanae Keith has known him since they were about 15 years old. She is the \\nmother of Mr. Patten’s five-year old son. She observed that he was frequently alone due \\nto his mother’s work schedule, which made him susceptible to picking up “bad \\ncompany”. He did not choose his friends well. Mr. James, his co-accused in this matter \\nwas one long-time friend with a lengthy criminal history. \\n[20] \\nAnti-Black racism was the most difficult part of Mr. Patten’s Canadian education \\nand schooling experience as it persisted throughout and excluded him from enjoying a \\npositive learning experience. He was relegated to a lower cadre of students considered to \\nhave learning difficulty, the majority of whom were racialized. He was kicked out of \\nschool in Grade 10 for fighting and non-attendance.  \\n[21] \\nAt his next school, there were three Black educators but instead of attending class, \\nMr. Patten hung out with other Jamaican youths who shared their experience of \\nimmigration and anti-Black racism and engaged in daily cannabis and alcohol use. He \\nwas eventually kicked out of that school as well for fighting and non-attendance. \\n[22] \\nHe discontinued his education in Grade 11. Continuing to associate with “the \\nwrong crowd” led to his early adult involvement in the criminal justice system. Alcohol \\nand cannabis gave him some relief from the pain of his father’s death, the re-settlement, \\nand their financial struggles. He began to drink very heavily but is happy to now be living \\nwithout cannabis and alcohol while in detention. He intends to leave that life behind.   \\n[23] \\nMr. Patten expressed remorse for his actions, “I am very sorry for the things I \\ndid”. He stated that his involvement in this home invasion was rooted in greed. He \\nwanted things for himself and his children. Ms. Keith believes that Chavez’s path into \\ncriminality is rooted in the hardships he experienced - his father’s death, leaving Jamaica, \\nstruggling in Canada, being alone and the desire for material possessions, but she rejects \\nhis choices. She asked, “at what cost are you going to provide for your family?” \\n[24] \\nSo, in summary, Mr. Patten’s early years of life in Jamaica were idyllic until the \\nage of 10. He went from being raised in a loving, financially secure family context to \\nexperiencing the sudden death of his father in a tragic car accident, the upheaval of re-\\nsettling in Canada, and the poverty that came with it. Ms. Richards, the author of his \\nreport, notes that accepted research shows that the loss of such an important attachment \\nfigure is considered ‘one of the most emotionally distressing, and psychologically \\ndisruptive events that an individual may encounter’, as was the case for both Mr. Patten \\nand his mother. \\n[25] \\nBy the time he was in Grade 11, Mr. Patten eventually dismissed education to \\nfocus on hanging out with friends, engaging in substance use and learning how to survive \\nthrough criminality. These youthful decisions created the path to his adult circumstances \\nand offered short-lived benefits. Mr. Patten’s lifestyle choices led to him being a target of \\ntwo near-death shooting events, to having a criminal record that may pose barriers to \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nfuture employment and having compromised his freedom. His three children are also \\nwithout the presence of their father, an unfortunate outcome, given that Mr. Chavez \\nhimself believed that his life outcomes would have been better had his father not died. He \\nfaces sentencing for serious offences. Ms. Richards concludes, however, that his path into \\nthe criminal system was initially triggered by his family’s experience of poverty, an issue \\nthat disproportionately impacts Black and racialized people. \\n[26] \\nFinally, I note that Mr. Patten was employed with Murray Landscaping from May \\n2019 until November 2020, in pool maintenance and landscaping and was a well-\\nregarded employee. This came to an end when he was detained in custody. This employer \\nwas hoping at that time to have him back. It is unknown if this would still be the case \\nafter he serves his sentence, but it does confirm that he has the prospects to be a valued \\nemployee.  \\n(ii) Rushsean James  \\n[27] \\nI feel obliged at the outset to say that the ESPR prepared by Ms. J. Pemberton has \\nan enormous level of detail that cannot possibly be reproduced in these reasons. Mr. \\nJames’ EPSR is an exhibit on this sentencing, so, if there is any deficiency in my efforts \\nto summarize its key aspects, I refer readers to the original.  \\n[28] \\nRushsean James is a 33-year-old Black man of Jamaican descent. He has an older \\nsister, Rochelle by the same parents, and an additional 8 siblings on his father’s side. Mr. \\nJames and his 4-year partner, Maria Providence, share a son, Armani, who is 1. \\n[29] \\nHis mother, Donna Lee McFarlane is 62 years old. She was born in Jamaica. She \\nmigrated to Canada at 21 on the sponsorship of her then husband and entered as a landed \\nimmigrant. Unfortunately, she was detained upon her arrival in Toronto in 1983 when \\ndrugs she claimed to be unaware of were found in her luggage. Ms. McFarlane was \\ncharged with drug offences, convicted, and sentenced to 12 months in jail. \\n[30] \\nFollowing her release, she remarried and had two children with Patrick Lowe: \\nRochelle and Rushsean. She lived in Toronto for 14 years, regularly travelling back and \\nforth to Jamaica, but learned on her return from one trip that she was subject to a \\ndeportation order. She was deported to Jamaica in 1996 when Mr. James was 6.  \\n[31] \\nEverything changed. She left her children in the care of a good friend, Pauline \\nLawrence because she did not think their father was responsible. Ms. Lawrence later \\nbecame their legal guardian in their mother’s absence. Her deportation causes Ms. \\nMcFarlane deep sadness because she believes it played a key role in her son’s outcomes. \\n[32] \\nHis father, Patrick Lowe was born in Jamaica and migrated to Canada when he \\nwas 23. He lived in Toronto with his mother and over time adjusted to life in a new \\nenvironment but continued to see his children on weekends. Mr. Lowe has worked for \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nover 30 years in various roles with a The Fern Group company and is currently a \\nwarehouse supervisor. Mr. James and his sister Rochelle were close in age and protective \\nof one another, but this changed with Mr. James’s increasing involvement in the criminal \\njustice system.  \\n[33] \\nWhile being raised by Ms. Lawrence, Mr. James developed a close relationship \\nwith a cousin, Aaron, who played a primary male figure role in his life. Mr. James’ \\ncriminal involvements upset Aaron, yet he continued to be in contact while Mr. James \\nwas in custody. In 2019, when Aaron passed away in his sleep while Mr. James was in \\njail, he felt badly that he could not say goodbye or be a support to his family. \\n[34] \\nMr. James always enjoyed playing sports such as hockey, but he flourished in \\nbasketball. He was playing on a house league and rep team by grade 11 that afforded him \\nopportunities to compete in the U.S. He stopped playing basketball in his late teens due to \\nlimited finances but has picked it up again more recently. \\n[35] \\nMs. Providence believes a primary factor in Mr. James’s engagement in crime is \\nthat he felt “neglected” by not having his own parents involved in critical aspects of his \\nlife. She believes this sense of loss continues to hinder him. His sister, Rochelle, agrees. \\nTheir mother’s deportation had a significant impact on him, and he struggled to develop \\nas a young man.  \\n[36] \\nBecoming a father has changed his life and has given Mr. James a bigger purpose. \\nMs. Providence is a mother of 4 boys, and their son, Armani is the youngest. Evidently, \\nhe is a very good father to their son and her older children and is very supportive of her, \\nand she depends on him for caregiving and financial support as she attends college full-\\ntime. They both worry about the separation that he will experience and the adjustments \\nand external supports that will be required in his absence while serving his sentence.  \\n[37] \\nMr. James grew up in different neighborhoods in Toronto and Peel Region, first, \\naround Jane Street and Trethewey Drive, a high-crime area where gang activity, gun \\nviolence and drug dealing occurred. At the end of middle school, he relocated to \\nBrampton when Ms. Lawrence purchased a home. Towards the end of Grade 12, he \\nmoved in with his father in the Driftwood community near Jane and Finch in Toronto, \\nwhere the same concerns prevailed about criminal activity.  \\n[38] \\nDue to his father’s steady work schedule, he did not see him regularly. He veered \\noff and began smoking cannabis, hanging out with friends, and partying. He became \\nfocused on acquiring fashionable clothing and jewelry. Fulfilling these wants led him to \\nget into trouble as a youth. He believes he might not have interacted with the criminal \\njustice system if he had more support from his father. \\n[39] \\nAt the age of 18 or 19, Mr. James moved back to Brampton, and began to sell \\ndrugs to stay afloat. He admits that his circumstances prompted him to engage in criminal \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nbehaviour to make ends meet. He admits his negative outcomes were related, both to the \\nbad company he kept and the poor life choices he made. \\n[40] \\nHe has worked in a variety of roles, but during his house arrest bail, has been \\nworking with his father at The Fern Group Ltd., where he has occupied several different \\nroles. He is now certified to drive a forklift, a skill that will open other opportunities in \\nthe future. It has also provided stability to his life. He hopes to return to college to \\ncomplete the program that he began in 2022 and would like to work with children to \\ndevelop programming for them.  \\n[41] \\nMr. James began to experience negative police interactions when he was 11. On \\none occasion while a police officer was searching the area for a suspect, he pointed his \\nfirearm at Rushsean’s face when he was on his way to school. He had numerous negative \\ncontacts with the police in Peel Region and was carded. Interactions with the police \\nusually became hostile because of the way the officers approached and spoke to him. He \\nwas regarded as suspicious because of his Black identity, style of dress and hairstyle, He \\nfeels “on edge” when in their presence. He believes the police abuse their power and get \\naway with misconduct towards Black and racialized people. \\n[42] \\nMr. James went from suspensions in elementary and middle school for fighting, to \\nimproving in Grade 6 and 7, when finally taught by a Black teacher, and successfully \\ncompleted high school in 2010 obtaining grades in the B to B+ range. In January 2021, \\nhe attended Sheridan College, but was dismissed for plainly race related reasons.  He felt \\ntargeted by the college and identified their actions as another form of racial profiling.  \\n[43] \\nIn January 2022, he was accepted into 5 programs at Seneca College. He chose the \\nChild and Youth Worker program, achieved excellent grades, and was placed on the \\nPresident’s Honour List for his academic achievement.  \\n[44] \\nMr. James has prior convictions for Possession for the Purpose of Trafficking and \\nPossession of a Prohibited Firearm. He claims to have learned from his offending \\nbehaviour that making money more slowly but legally is much better than making fast \\nmoney illegally.  \\n[45] \\nMs. Providence believes that his peer associations and need for financial security \\nled him to engage in crime, but he is no longer focused on criminal behaviour and is \\nhoping that he will get another chance to rehabilitate himself. She believes that Mr. James \\nis on a good path now, and with constant guidance she knows that he can have a \\nsuccessful life.  \\n[46] \\nSince being released on bail, Mr. James has been totally compliant and enjoys the \\nsimpler aspects of life such as being with his son or watching television shows. His \\nfamily and support group see great promise for him, and the potential to be a good person \\nwho can make the changes to his life that will be needed to keep him away from criminal \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\ntrouble. Once his sentence is completed, they believe he will be able to rebuild his life \\nand become a greater man. \\n4. Victim Impact Statements \\n[47] \\nIn this case, there were multiple firearms used. Mr.  Fernando was seriously \\ninjured when he was pistol whipped and could have been killed if Mr. Patten was a better \\nshot. It is understood Mr. Fernando has his own antecedents with the law, was not a \\nvoluntary witness, and has not provided an impact statement, but I feel safe taking \\njudicial notice that of course these events would have impacted him: (i) that his family \\nhome, where he lived, sometimes with his parents, was invaded in such a planned and \\ndeliberate manner; and (ii) that he would have been seriously impacted by the injuries \\nthat he sustained and the loss of valuables. I find that there would have been substantial \\nimpact on Mr. Fernando, despite the absence of a victim impact statement from him. \\n[48] \\nCrown counsel tendered a number of victim impact statements from the \\nneighbours that lived in that community, on Lafferty Street and Persimmon Court, and \\neach and every one of them spoke of being fearful and of the inability to sleep following \\nthese events.  \\n[49] \\nThey fear that the neighbourhood that attracted them and that they once saw as a \\nvery quiet and safe place to live and raise families, was now the location of an all-out \\nshootout in the middle of the street. The reality of their fear and the impact of these \\nevents is confirmed by none of them being willing to identify themselves.  These are \\ncompletely and entirely innocent victims in these offences, yet their lives are changed.  \\n[50] \\n It is clear that that these events on March 10, 2020, had great impact on many of \\nthe people who live on that street. No one was killed, despite the location of 16 shell \\ncasings on the ground in the vicinity, and the only injury was to Mr. Fernando, but these \\npeople have been injured permanently in a much more subtle but frightening way. These \\npeople can no longer feel their “home is their castle”, a safe place, because the fact that \\nthese events shattered that calm and quiet permanently, will not soon be forgotten.  \\nPositions of the Crown and Defence \\n[51] \\nFor Mr. Patten, the Crown seeks a global sentence of twelve (12) years: eight (8) \\nyears for the armed robbery and the mandatory minimum five (5) year sentence for \\ndischarging a firearm with intent, a four (4) year concurrent sentence for possession of a \\nloaded firearm, and a one (1) year sentence concurrent to one another, but consecutive to \\nthe other sentences, for the seven failure to comply offences. This totals 14 years, but \\nCrown counsel reduces it to 12 years based on principles of totality and proportionality.  \\n[52] \\nFor Mr. James, the Crown seeks a global sentence of nine (9) years, that is, eight \\n(8) years for the principal offences plus a one-year sentence, consecutive to any other \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nsentence, imposed for the failure to comply with a weapons prohibition order.  Crown \\ncounsel acknowledges she seeks the same sentence for Mr. James on the robbery as for \\nMr. Patten, even though Mr. James never got out of the car and did not discharge a \\nfirearm but grounds that in Mr. James’ criminal record. Just two years before, Mr. James \\nhad been convicted of possession of a loaded firearm. \\n[53] \\nCounsel for Mr. Patten advocates for a total global sentence of six (6) years for the \\noffences, followed by a period of probation. He acknowledges that the applicable range \\nfor Mr. Patten should be eight (8) to ten (10) years, but suggested a lesser sentence is \\ncalled for to reflect important mitigating principles relevant in Mr. Patten’s \\ncircumstances. \\n[54] \\nCounsel for Mr. James advocates in all the circumstances, for a total global \\nsentence of five (5) years for the offences, recognizing the five-year mandatory minimum \\nthat applies to robbery with a firearm. He says the other offences should receive one (1) \\nyear concurrent. While he acknowledges that fail to comply sentences are served \\nconsecutive to the principal offences as a distinct and separate delict, in his submission \\nthere was no evidence that Mr. James ever handled a firearm, and that the evidence \\nshows he never went into Mr. Fernando’s house. \\n[55] \\nAll parties agree that ancillary orders should go requiring both offenders to supply \\na sample of their DNA and prohibiting both offenders from possessing weapons for life. \\n[56] \\nCounsel for both offenders agree that both should receive credit for time served, \\npursuant to R. v. Summers, 2013 ONCA 147. They also agree that some credit should be \\ngiven for the difficult detention conditions experienced by Mr. Patten while incarcerated \\nat Maplehurst Corrections Centre and Mr. James when initially held without bail, and \\nduring an extended strict period of house arrest, pursuant to R. v. Duncan, 2016 ONCA \\n754. \\n5. Legal Principles \\n(i) Principles and Purposes of Sentencing \\n[57] \\nMessrs. Patten and James (along with Mr. Taitt) planned and executed a violent \\nhome invasion. Emma Hinch was involved as the person who would permit entry into the \\nhome. She provided the address to the group and opened the door for them when they \\narrived. Patten and his former co-accused, Mr. Taitt, armed with firearms and their faces \\nmasked entered the home and kicked down the bathroom door to find the victim. They \\npistol whipped him. They stole jewelry. They stole cash. Blood was everywhere. \\n[58] \\nAs Mr. Patten ran out of the home to the driveway, he turned and shot at the victim, \\nnarrowly missing him. Mr. James was confronted by a group of men with firearms, and \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nthey shot at him as he ran from the getaway vehicle. This was a well-orchestrated plan – \\nuntil the unexpected happened. \\n[59] \\nSection 718 of the Criminal Code states the fundamental purposes of sentencing \\nand lists its underlying objectives. The fundamental purpose of any and every sentence is \\nto contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe \\nsociety by the imposition of just and appropriate sanctions.  Among the specific \\nobjectives listed in s. 718 of the Code, the most important in this case are deterrence, \\nspecific and general; the denunciation of unlawful conduct; the protection of the public; \\nand the separation of offenders from society where necessary. That said, rehabilitation is \\nalways an important sentencing objective, and this is especially true in circumstances \\nwhere the Morris factors are in play. That calls upon the court to balance that factor \\nagainst the need for a strong message of deterrence and denunciation, within the social \\ncontext of these offenders’ lives.  \\n[60] \\nSections 718.1 and 718.2 also contain important objectives relevant in this case. \\nThe test of proportionality requires that the sentence speak out against the offence, but it \\nmust not exceed what is just and appropriate given the moral blameworthiness of the \\noffender and the gravity of the offence, as compared to other offenders and the \\ncircumstances of their crimes. Taken together, with s. 718.2(b), the court must strive to \\nensure that the sentence imposed respects the principles of proportionality and \\nconsistency of sentences for similar offences in similar circumstances: see R. v. \\nNasogaluak, [2010] S.C.C. 6. \\n[61] \\nJust as an aboriginal offender’s moral blameworthiness may be reduced because of \\nthe direct impact on the offender of the systemic and historic subjugation of Aboriginal \\npeoples, as described in R. v. Gladue, so too the moral blameworthiness of these two \\noffenders may be reduced because of the direct impact their experience dealing with \\nsystemic racism in Canada has on the social context within which these offences were \\ncommitted. This social context is fully described in the ESPRs for each of the offenders.  \\n[62] \\nSubject to specific statutory rules, however, the determination of a fit sentence is \\nalways an individualized process that requires the judge to weigh the objectives of \\nsentencing in a manner that best reflects the circumstances of the case.  No one \\nsentencing objective supercedes the others and the relative importance of aggravating or \\nmitigating factors will push a sentence up or down on the scale of appropriate sentences \\nfor similar offences.  \\n[63] \\nThe Crown correctly submits that the principles of denunciation and deterrence are \\nthe primary considerations for this Court in a home invasion armed robbery, as approved \\nby the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Wright, [2006] 83 O.R. (3d) 427. Likewise, it is \\nwell established that deterrence and denunciation are the primary sentencing \\nconsiderations for offences involving firearms. At para. 13 of Wright, the court states: \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nHome invasion is a serious, and increasingly prevalent, crime in our society. For a \\ndiscussion of its essential nature and the variety of circumstances “home \\ninvasion” can embrace, see R. v. S. (J.) (2006), 210 C.C.C. (3d) 296 (Ont. C.A.). \\nThe crime committed by Mr. Wright constitutes a home invasion because it was \\ncharacterized by the invaders’ forced entry into the victims’ home for purposes of \\ncommitting a theft or robbery, knowing that (or being reckless as to whether) the \\nhome was being occupied, and by the accompanying use or threatened use of \\nviolence with guns, together with the confinement of the occupants of the home. \\n \\n[64] \\nIn R. v. Soares, [1996] O.J. No. 5488 (Ont. Gen. Div.) at para. 286, referenced at \\npara. 14 of Wright, Trafford J. of this court eloquently explained why stiff sentences are \\ncalled for in home invasion robberies: \\nThe sanctity of one's home is of fundamental importance in a free and democratic \\nsociety. It is constitutionally recognized in our country. Everyone must not only \\nbe, but feel, secure in their residence. A society that tolerates significant criminal \\nintrusions into the privacy of one's home is a society that forces it citizens to \\nresort to self-help to protect themselves against such wrongs. Absent effective \\nresponses from the judiciary, the alternative is for citizens to arm themselves in \\nanticipation of a need to defend themselves against such criminal enterprises. A \\nsociety like that is not ours today, has not been ours in the past, and will not be \\nours in the future. The obligation of the Court is to give proper recognition to the \\nsanctity of the home, to protect all citizens against such intrusions, and to thereby \\npreserve the public's confidence in the administration of justice. \\n \\n[65] \\nIt is for these reasons that a stiff penitentiary term is generally warranted upon \\nconviction for a home invasion offence subject only to the mitigating effects of the \\nMorris factors that are relevant to determining a fit sentence for each of Mr. Patten and \\nMr. James, and their entitlements to credit under R. v. Summers and R. v. Downes.  \\n(ii) Principles of sentencing a first-time and youthful offender \\n[66] \\nIn determining the fit sentence for Mr. Patten, I am also mindful of the fact that he \\nis a young man who had no criminal record before these offences arose. He is presently \\nserving another subsequent sentence in detention, but this will be Mr. Patten’s first \\npenitentiary sentence. The Court of Appeal has said that a “first penitentiary sentence \\nshould be as short as possible”: R. v. Borde (2003), 172 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.). The \\nlength of a first penitentiary sentence for a youthful offender should rarely be determined \\nsolely by objectives of denunciation and general deterrence. \\n[67] \\nIn R. v. Priest (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 294-295, Rosenberg \\nJ.A. stressed that the primary objectives in sentencing a first offender are individual \\ndeterrence and rehabilitation. Community-based dispositions are to be considered first, \\nbut there is no suggestion here that a non-custodial sentence would be appropriate. \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nCounsel agree that a custodial sentence is appropriate and necessary. Nevertheless, a first \\nsentence of imprisonment should be as short as possible and tailored to the individual \\ncircumstances of the accused rather than solely for the purpose of general deterrence.  \\n[68] \\nIn the more recent decision in R. v. Brown, 2015 ONCA 361 (Ont. C.A.), however, \\nwhile the accused was a young first-time offender, he had participated in an extremely \\nviolent home invasion for which a lengthy penitentiary term was called for. The court \\nconfirmed that the “range for home invasions is four to five years at the low end, and up \\nto 11 to 13 years at the high end,” but at para. 5 also reaffirms that:  \\n…while individual deterrence and rehabilitation are the primary objectives in \\nsentencing a first offender, the importance and weight of other factors increase \\nwith the seriousness of the crime. This approach respects the fundamental \\nprinciple of sentencing stated in s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code: “a sentence must \\nbe proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of \\nthe offender.” \\n \\n[69] \\nThe trial judge had imposed a sentence of seven years for convictions on robbery, \\nrobbery with a firearm, and aggravated assault, three years concurrent for uttering threats, \\nthree years concurrent for forcible confinement, and two years consecutive for the \\nunlawful possession of a firearm, resulting in a total sentence of nine years. Recognizing \\nthe range for home invasions set in Wright, above, the court found the sentence to be fit, \\nbut reduced it from 9 years to seven since the unlawful possession offence under s. 91(1) \\ndid not require a consecutive sentence. At para. 10, the court concludes: \\nWe would vary the sentence by making the sentence for unlawful possession of a \\nfirearm concurrent to the other sentences thereby reducing the appellant's total \\nsentence from nine years to seven years to properly reflect that individual \\ndeterrence and rehabilitation remained the paramount factors on his sentencing. \\n[Emphasis added] \\n \\n(iii) Principles relating to social context – Morris factors \\n[70] \\nAs a starting point, it is now fully accepted that the decision in R. v. Morris, 2021 \\nONCA 680, [2021] O.J. No. 5108, and the decisions in numerous cases decided since \\nthen, inform the proposition that I must, at the outset, make a frank acknowledgement of \\nthe existence of and the harm caused by systemic anti-black racism, generally, and as it \\npertains to these two offenders. I am called upon to consider these factors in mitigation. \\n[71] \\nIt is clear from the EPSR report not only that Mr. Patten was directly affected by \\nsystemic racism, but also that life has been very difficult for him since the death of his \\nfather. However, Crown counsel suggested that while very helpful in understanding who \\nMr. Patten is and what his life was and is like, the report provides less context to explain \\nwhy Mr. Patten armed himself with a firearm that night and chose to invade Mr. \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nFernando’s home and inflict the injuries he did. Crown counsel submitted it did not \\nprovide the added layer of explaining away some of this behaviour. \\n[72] \\nShe submitted the same was true of Mr. James. His ESPR makes plain that anti-\\nblack racism has affected him. The deportation of his mother is heart wrenching and the \\nabsence of his father in his young upbringing certainly had significant consequences on \\nhis development. At six years of age, Mr. James had to endure being ripped away from \\nhis mother, to stay in Canada with his sister under the care of a close friend of his mother. \\nWhile his father was in Canada, he was only intermittently involved with his son during \\nhis young life, certainly not as much as I’m sure he would have hoped for. Those two \\nevents, or perhaps better stated, omissions, had very significant consequences for Mr. \\nJames, and it is clear that anti-black racism played a part in that. \\n[73] \\nAs in Mr. Patten’s case, however, it is said to help understand who Mr. James is \\nand how he came to be who he is, but Crown counsel submits it is less useful to explain \\nwhy Mr. James drove two other armed men to another town to commit a home invasion.  \\n[74] \\nHowever, the purpose is not to excuse the conduct, and it need not be to explain a \\ndirect link between the background and the specifics of the offence, but rather to explain \\nits social context. It is to show that both offenders have been subjected to systemic racism \\nthroughout most of their lives, as well as extremely negative life altering events and \\ndisadvantages. It is proferred in support of balance between deterrence and denunciation, \\nmoral culpability, and the rehabilitative prospects of these two individuals. It serves that \\nfunction within the context of the mandate explained at para. 61 of Morris, that \\nproportionality is the fundamental and overarching principle of sentencing, measured by \\nreference to both the offence and the offender: see R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at \\npara. 40; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, 391 C.C.C. (3d) 309, at para. 30. \\n \\n[75] \\nAt para. 66, the court references R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. \\n1089 at para. 12, where the majority again emphasized that: \\n \\n[P]roportionality is the cardinal principle that must guide appellate courts in \\nconsidering the fitness of a sentence imposed on an offender. The more serious \\nthe crime and its consequences, or the greater the offender’s degree of \\nresponsibility, the heavier the sentence will be. In other words, the severity of a \\nsentence depends not only on the seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but \\nalso on the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Determining a proportionate \\nsentence is a delicate task. \\n \\n[76] \\nLooked at from that perspective, the role of social context evidence in the \\ncircumstances of sentencing offenders like Mr. Patten and Mr. James becomes clear. In \\nMorris, Tulloch J.A. as he then was, explains at paras. 79-81 that: \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n79      The social context evidence can, however, provide a basis upon which a \\ntrial judge concludes that the fundamental purpose of sentencing, as outlined in s. \\n718, is better served by a sentence which, while recognizing the seriousness of the \\noffence, gives less weight to the specific deterrence of the offender and greater \\nweight to the rehabilitation of the offender through a sentence that addresses the \\nsocietal disadvantages caused to the offender by factors such as systemic racism. \\n \\n80      Blending the various objectives of sentencing is the essence of the \\nsentencing process. There is seldom one and only one fit sentence. As long as the \\nsentence imposed complies with the proportionality requirement in s. 718.1, trial \\njudges are given considerable discretion to decide how best to blend the various \\nlegitimate objectives of sentencing. If trial judges operate within that band of \\ndiscretion, the different weight assigned to different objectives may produce \\ndifferent but nonetheless equally fit sentences. \\n \\n81      In the present case, the social context evidence provided a basis upon which \\nthe trial judge could give added weight to the objective of rehabilitation and less \\nweight to the objective of specific deterrence. By doing so, the trial judge would \\nnot diminish the seriousness of the crime but would recognize that the ultimate \\nsentence imposed must be tailored to the specific offender and the potential \\nrehabilitation of that offender. As long as the sentence ultimately imposed \\nremains proportionate to the offence and the offender, the actual sentence \\nimposed would be a fit sentence. \\n \\n[77] \\nWhile I accept Crown counsel’s advocacy in favour of a more direct link between \\nthe social context evidence and the specific crime, as was the case in Morris, in its \\nsummary, at paras. 106-107, the court explains that is not the only purpose for which \\nsuch evidence will be admitted:  \\n \\n106      In summary, social context evidence, which helps explain how the \\noffender came to commit the offence, or which allows for a more informed and \\naccurate assessment of the offender’s background, character and potential when \\nchoosing from among available sanctions, is relevant and admissible on \\nsentencing. Acknowledging the reality of anti-Black racism and its impact on \\noffenders like Mr. Morris during the sentencing process enhances the legitimacy \\nof the criminal justice system in the eyes of the community and, in particular, \\nthose in the community who have good reason to see the criminal justice system \\nas racist and unjust. A sentencing process which frankly acknowledges and \\naddresses the realities of the offender’s life takes one important step toward the \\ngoal of equal justice for all. \\n \\n107      We see nothing new in the approach to sentencing described above. It \\nreflects the individualized offence and offender-specific approach to sentencing \\nthat has always held sway in Canadian courts. The sentencing process, as it exists, \\ncan properly and fairly take into account anti-Black racism and its impact on the \\noffender’s responsibility, and the selection of an appropriate sanction in all the \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\ncircumstances. What is new is the kind of information provided in reports like the \\ntwo filed in this case and a judicial willingness to receive, understand, and act on \\nthat evidence. (Emphasis added) \\n \\n6. Analysis  \\n(i) Findings on Appropriate Range \\n[78] \\nThere is little disagreement between counsel on the applicable ranges that should \\napply here but the range is broad: from a low of 4 years to a high of 13 years for a home \\ninvasion armed robbery, writ large: see Wright, above. It is the placement of these \\noffenders on that continuum that is the more difficult task.  \\n[79] \\nCrown counsel’s request for 8 years for the armed robbery, plus the 5-year \\nmandatory minimum for discharging the firearm consecutive, and 1 year for seven fail to \\ncomply offences, again consecutive would have exceeded that 13-year range in Mr. \\nPatten’s case, but she reduced her requested sentence to 12 years based on principles of \\ntotality, before credits. She also uses Mr. Taitt’s sentence of 7 years, but on an early plea, \\nas a differentiation and explanation for the lengthier sentences sought here.  \\n[80] \\nMr. Patten’s counsel takes the position that the applicable range for him should be \\n8 to 10 years, but he advocates that a lesser sentence of 6 years is called for to reflect \\nimportant mitigating principles relevant in Mr. Patten’s circumstances, largely relating to \\nMorris factors. \\n[81] \\nFor Mr. James, Crown counsel seeks the same eight-year sentence for the robbery \\nthat she seeks for Mr. Patten, plus one year consecutive for the violation of the weapons \\nprohibition imposed upon him two years ago, for a total of nine years before credit. Mr. \\nJames’s counsel instead advocates for a lower sentence of six (6) years, for the reasons \\noutlined above.  \\n[82] \\nTo dispose of the easier issue first, I look first at the appropriate sentence for the \\nfail to comply and breach of prohibition offences. It seems well settled that the breaches \\nare separate delicts, distinct from the armed robbery and discharge firearm related \\noffences.  \\n[83] \\nThe issue is fully canvassed in the Court of Appeal’s three decisions in R. v. \\nHoule, 2008 ONCA 287, R. v. McCue, [2012] O.J. No. 6381 (C.A.), and R. v. Claro, \\n2019 ONCA 626, and in this court, in R. v. Addow, 2014 ONSC 3225 at paras. 29-35. \\nMoreover, Parliament has made it clear in ss. 718.3(4), that consecutive sentences should \\nbe imposed when the offences do not arise out of the same event or series of events, or \\nwhen different societal interests are engaged. \\n \\n[84] \\nIn Addow, above, at para 29, I wrote (citations omitted):  \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nAs a sentencing matter, the decision whether to impose consecutive or concurrent \\nsentences relates principally to whether the offender is being sentenced for \\ndifferent convictions related to separate events and committed at different times. \\nThis is subject only to the modifying effect of the principles of totality and \\nproportionality: see Renaud, The Sentencing Code of Canada: Principles and \\nObjectives, where the author affirms that:   \\n \\nSeparate events or transactions ought to result in consecutive sentences if \\nthe result is a total term that is not unduly long or harsh, and thus confirms \\nto s. 718.2(c) and that does not offend the proportionality requirement of s. \\n718.1 of the Criminal Code.  \\n \\n[85] \\nThis position is reflected in Houle and McCue: both comment upon the \\ncircumstances where consecutive sentences can and ought to be imposed. In Houle, at \\npara. 4, Laskin J.A. stated as follows: \\n4.  It was also open to the sentencing judge to impose consecutive sentences for \\nthe firearms-related offences. The deference that is due the sentencing judge on \\nmatters of sentencing generally applies to the decision whether to make sentences \\nconsecutive or concurrent: R. v. McDonnell (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 436 (S.C.C.). \\nAlthough these offences were temporally linked, they constitute invasions of \\ndifferent legally protected interests. The sentencing judge was entitled to bring \\nhome the seriousness of the offences by imposing consecutive sentences for the \\nfirearms offences. See R. v. Gummer, [1983] O.J. No. 181 (C.A.). The principal \\nof totality was also satisfied. \\n \\n[86] \\nIn McCue at para. 20, the court observes in part:  \\n…A concurrent sentence denigrates the significance of the mischief charge and \\nsuggests that it is not in and of itself worthy of punishment. Of course, in fixing \\nthe appropriate length of a consecutive sentence, a trial judge must have regard to \\nthe totality of the sentences to be imposed. Totality concerns can, however, be \\nadequately addressed by adjusting the length of the various consecutive sentences, \\nif necessary. \\n \\n[87] \\nIn my view, these authorities support the proposition that sentences for breaches of \\norders of the court ought to attract consecutive sentences, to be adjusted, if necessary, by \\nthe totality and proportionality principles. Counsel for Mr. James suggests he should \\nreceive only a brief, perhaps 6-month sentence for breach of his weapons prohibition \\norder. In my view to bring home the seriousness of the offence of breaching a firearms \\nprohibition order requires not only that the sentence be consecutive, but also that it be of \\n1-years duration. Mr. Patten’s fail to comply offences are of less seriousness than the \\nweapons prohibition offence, but there are seven offences. I find this fact invites the same \\nsentence as I impose on Mr. James, that is, 1 year consecutive, in both cases, as requested \\nby Crown counsel. \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[88] \\nTurning now to the more complex and difficult question of sentence relating to the \\nprincipal offences, dealing first with Mr. Patten, I recognize that Crown counsel’s \\nposition of 12 years has already been reduced from 14 based on totality principles. \\nHowever, I do not accept that in all the circumstances of this case, a sentence of twelve \\nyears is called for in Mr. Patten’s case. In my view, this overemphasizes denunciation, \\ngeneral deterrence, and the need to separate Mr. Patten from society.  \\n[89] \\nCrown counsel references Justice Kelly’s sentence in R. v. Owusu-Sarpong, [2021] \\nO.J. No. 5362 at para 41, but that is at the highest level because of the victims, and the \\nparticular circumstances. I do not think Mr. Fernando can be characterized as a \\nvulnerable victim, and, as I have noted elsewhere, he appeared to know something was \\nup that night. That was why he got his own firearm out of his car and made the phone \\ncalls that appeared to precipitate the arrival of the BMW and its shooters, there plainly to \\nhave a shootout with these four co-conspirators. The 16 shell casings located on the \\nstreets and nearby shows that is what happened.  \\n[90] \\nI also realize that Mr. Patten does not get the benefit of a plea at an early date, \\nThat is not the case here but given the sentence imposed upon Mr. Taitt, whose \\ncircumstances are otherwise similar if not the same as Mr. Patten’s at least with respect to \\nthe offence, the additional 5 years consecutive seems punitive and excessively harsh.  \\n[91] \\nWhile I fully accept that Mr. Patten has committed very serious crimes, I also \\naccept he is very remorseful, and tuned into the different channel his life needs to take \\ngoing forward, that his risk of reoffending is at most in the low range, if that, and that as a \\nfirst time offender, with very good rehabilitation prospects, I am required to impose the \\nminimum sentence appropriate in the circumstances. I am also required to factor in his \\nsocial context.  \\n[92] \\nIn these circumstances. I believe a sentence in the range of 9-11 years would be a \\nmore appropriate starting point before applying Morris factors and before other credits. I \\nbase this in large measure on the Court of Appeal’s decision in R. v. Brown, above, which \\nis different, but where the Court dealt with a sentence appeal by a youthful first offender \\ninvolved in a very violent home invasion and varied it down from nine years to seven \\nyears. and noting that the range for home invasions is 4 to 5 years at the low end, and up \\nto 11 to 13 years at the high end.  \\n[93] \\nIn the case of Mr. James, I believe and find the range applicable to him should also \\nbe lower than the nine-year sentence requested by Crown counsel. Despite his prior \\nfirearm related offence, I find that the quality of Mr. James’s moral culpability is just not \\nthe same as Mr. Patten’s, or Mr. Taitt’s. It is lower, in my view, in the range of 7 to 9 \\nyears, but again, before applying Morris factors and before other credits.  \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n(ii) Aggravating and Mitigating Factors \\n[94] \\nCounsel for both offenders contend they were motivated solely by greed, but \\nCrown counsel contends, correctly in my view, that there was more to it than simply \\ngreed. It makes no sense that greed was the sole motivator given that this developed as a \\nplanned and deliberate hit on this particular house in Etobicoke, with Mr. Fernando \\npresent inside, far from where the co-accused were resident in Brampton. The offence \\nwas not because of what was inside that was of value, it was that it was Mr. Fernando \\ninside, and he was their specific target. Indeed, his time on the phone outside the house \\nlooking around furtively, and his actions arming himself with his own firearm from one \\nof the cars in the driveway, certainly suggests he was apprehensive of something \\nhappening. Moreover, as noted, only Mr. Fernando could have called for the appearance \\nof his friends in the BMW who arrive in the middle of the melee and started shooting at \\nthese co-conspirators, themselves. That was not mere coincidence.  \\n[95] \\nI accept the most likely story was that Mr. Fernando was their target, in what was \\nobviously some sort of revenge action, instigated by the elusive rap man, Killa Da Crook, \\nto remedy an insult or some perceived lack of respect. Mr. Fernando indicated that he and \\nthis Mr. Crook individual had some sort of issue, and it was his belief, at least, that Mr. \\nPatten, Mr. James, and Mr. Taitt came at his behest. The parties obviously had conflict \\nenough that these offenders who do not appear to have known Mr. Fernando before, \\nwould drive from Brampton to this specific home in Etobicoke to pistol whip this man. \\nAs well, however, it appears the plan would not have and did not originate from them, \\nbut rather at the instance of Mr. Crook. He had the goal and they tried to implement it on \\nhis behalf, and I expect with his instruction.  \\n[96] \\nWhile I accept this reasoning, much more logical than mere greed, I do not make \\nthat finding as an aggravating feature because it is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. \\nBut the involvement and prompting of Mr. Crook is mitigating, and in my view, meets \\nthe required level of proof on a balance of probabilities. As such, in my view, modified \\nby these findings, the aggravating circumstances in this case applicable to both offenders, \\ninclude the following: \\n(i) \\nThe victim was viciously attacked in his own home. \\n(ii) \\nThere was planning and deliberation involved. \\n(iii) \\nA getaway car was used to assist in a quick exit. \\n(iv) \\nThere were four people involved in this plan. One was already inside, and \\ntwo more entered the home, outnumbering the victim. \\n(v) \\nMultiple firearms were used. \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n(vi) \\nThe impact on the victim. \\n(vii) The impact on the neighbourhood has been overwhelming and is highly \\naggravating, with numerous residents, too fearful to identify themselves, \\nidentifying a constant sense of fear and continuing sleeplessness. \\n(viii) Mr. Patten and Mr. Taitt used gratuitous violence in beating Mr. Fernando \\nwith a firearm. \\n(ix) \\nMr. Patten was breaching three different bails at the time. \\n(x) \\nMr. James’ has a criminal record. He was breaching a firearms prohibition at \\nthe time of these events. \\n[97] \\nOn the other hand, the mitigating circumstances in this case include the following: \\n(i) \\nAt the time of these offences Mr. Patten did not have criminal record (and \\nobviously no prior firearm related offences). \\n(ii) \\nAt 27, Mr. Patten is a relatively youthful, first time (in the circumstances) \\noffender. \\n(iii) \\nMr. Patten has already served approximately 24 months in custody on the \\nBrampton matters. He has had a full taste of the imprisonment experience, \\nas reflected in his remorseful and thoughtful letter to the court. \\n(iv) \\nSince Mr. Patten has been subjected to systemic racism as well as other \\nextremely negative, life altering events and disadvantages throughout most \\nof his life, his circumstances call on the court to show restraint by applying \\nthe Morris principles in mitigation.  \\n(v) \\nMr. Patten's prospects for rehabilitation remain very strong, as the EPSR \\nindicates. He has used his time in custody well and wisely. Rehabilitation \\nfor such a relatively young man is mandated to be a significant \\nconsideration, and not only deterrence and denunciation. The principles of \\ntotality and proportionality must also be considered. \\n(vi) \\nMr. Patten has done exceptionally well in moving in a rehabilitative \\ndirection while in custody. He has completed high school with very high \\ngrades, illustrative of diligence and determination. \\n(vii) Both offenders have clearly accepted responsibility, and both have \\nexpressed remorse for their actions, not only to the authors of the ESPR’s, \\nbut also directly to me in this court at the end of the sentencing hearing. \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n(viii) Mr. James also has done very well before and since the trial while \\nremaining in the community, with ankle monitoring. In particular, he has \\nbeen a caring father for a very young child, and has been working, without \\nincident, to provide for his wife and child, and her other children.  \\n(ix) \\nIn each of the two ESPR’s, one for each offender, there are factors of \\nsystemic and anti-black racism that R. v. Morris calls upon to be considered \\nin mitigation, not to excuse conduct but rather to create an understanding of \\nthe painful and systemic issues both offenders have experienced, each in his \\nown way, and the context that creates within which these offences should \\nbe viewed. In my view, as I outline below, the Morris factors apply to both \\noffenders, for reasons I will explain.  \\n(iii) Conclusions on the fit sentences for these offenders \\n[98] \\nTurning then to the evidence in this case, I find that the social context evidence \\nelaborated on in both Mr. Patten’s and Mr. James’s EPSR’s does provide me with a more \\ninformed and accurate assessment of the background, character, and potential of each of \\nthese offenders when choosing from among available sentencing sanctions.  \\n[99] \\nMr. Patten was subjected to assumptions, rooted in anti-Black racism, about his \\nalleged inability to speak English because of his Jamaican accent, yet Jamaica was a \\nBritish island and English remains the primary language that is spoken. The research \\nshows Black students with accents are often assessed to have English-learning needs (see \\nJames and Turner, 2017, p. 46). His first and only experience of belonging and \\nacceptance in education came from the Black teacher that he had in Grade 11, but that \\ncame at a stage too late to stop his exit from education altogether. The combination of \\nthese factors contributes to the so-called “school to prison pipeline”, a form of social \\nexclusion that results in Black students being disproportionately pushed out of the \\neducation system and turning to crime (see James and Turner, 2017, p. 9). \\n[100] Mr. Patten’s experience of anti-Black racism within the education system does not \\nsuggest he bears no accountability for his actions, past or present. He is responsible for \\nhis actions. He has plainly accepted responsibility for those actions. Rather, the \\ninformation provides context on the impact of systemic factors in the life of Mr. Patten, \\nand his response to them. \\n[101] In his EPSR, Ms. Richards concluded from her experience of working with \\nindividuals involved in the criminal system that this data highlights why crime is a more \\nlucrative option for people seeking to reintegrate post-incarceration, especially since \\nearnings typically may not exceed the minimum wage income that no longer supports \\ndaily living for many. Mr. Patten must contend with these realities if he is serious about \\nexiting the cycle of crime and incarceration, but he has expressed willingness to take any \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nemployment he can access as he has determined that it would be easier than risking his \\nlife and freedom again. Ideally, the process of rehabilitation will provide Mr. Patten with \\nappropriate education and training that will enable him to achieve his goals. This \\nsentence is the first step on that road. \\n[102] For Mr. James, his social history shows that loss, separation, and financial \\nstruggles have factored into his circumstances. His changed family dynamic altered his \\nlife from early childhood. The separation from his mother was damaging to him and has \\nbeen identified as the primary factor that set him on a path of criminality. \\n[103] His EPSR shows that the issue of absent fathers is also a risk factor for youth to \\nengage in crime. Ms. Pemberton reports from the research that an increased presence of \\nBlack fathers could influence Black youth to stay away from criminal behaviour. \\nHowever, Mr. James’ contact with his father was infrequent or at least irregular and by \\nthe time he moved back with him, he had already started to follow a negative path \\nthrough his associations with peers.  \\n[104] Numerous systemic influences may have impacted Mr. James’s trajectory and \\nexperiences. Income inequality, poverty and unemployment disproportionately affect \\nBlack residents and have been linked to choices of violence and criminality as a means to \\nsupport the financial needs of vulnerable populations. The EPSR author notes this \\nresonates with this offender’s circumstances, as he sought illegal ways to make money \\nonce he began to encounter barriers to secure legitimate employment. \\n[105]  A further negative in his case relates to systemic racism from police. The different \\ntreatment accorded by police to blacks and white counterparts demonstrated to him the \\nracial bias that exists within law enforcement. Mr. James experienced this as a child. His \\nencounters with the police began at the age of 11 in his Toronto neighbourhood, and \\nincreased as he grew older and relocated to Brampton. He incurred criminal charges as a \\nyouth that heightened the contact he had with the police and the profiling he experienced. \\nResearch on the impacts of policing on Black, Indigenous and racialized youth note that \\nracial profiling and over-policing are overt forms of racism that develop “tough \\ndemeanours” in young people, which can lead to increased conflict as they age.  \\n[106] Both authors, eminently qualified, explained that Anti-Black racism within \\npolicing has been well researched and continues to cause 80% of Black Ontarians to feel \\ntargeted because of their Black identity. As well, the frequency of interaction of Black \\nyouth with law enforcement is an antecedent of racial profiling that subsequently leads to \\ntheir over-representation in the criminal justice system. Mr. James’s EPSR refers to \\nToronto Police Service (TPS) research from 2022 that revealed that Black men were \\noverrepresented in “use of force” incidents when they encountered the police and were \\n2.3 times more likely to have a firearm pointed at them for no apparent reason. \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[107] In my view, while recognizing the effects of their respective backgrounds on their \\nmoral culpability, and in the balance of specific deterrence, and rehabilitation, Mr. \\nPatten’s background was somewhat more difficult than that of Mr. James. Mr. James’ \\ncircumstance of having his mother deported at the age of six was certainly traumatic, but \\nin my perception, even so, he had more supports available to him than Mr. Patten had. In \\nthe result, the combined effect of being a first-time offender for these purposes, and his \\nMorris factors results in me recognizing those mitigating factors somewhat more than in \\nMr. James’ case. \\n[108] Like P. Campbell J. in R. v. Tabnor, 2021 ONSC 8548, altered for these \\ndefendants, I find that the extensive evidence above, which I have accepted, supports a \\nconclusion that the offences that both offenders have been convicted of “are deserving of \\nsomewhat less moral opprobrium than similarly bad choices by a person who grew up in \\ncircumstances less shaped by racial bias and its consequences than [Mr. Patten’s and Mr. \\nJames.]” As in that case, I adopt Justice Campbell’s thoughtful conclusions, adapted to \\nthis case, as follows: \\nUltimately, knowing what I know of [Mr. Patten and Mr. James], [their] conduct, \\nand the milieu in which [each of them] came of age, I cannot reach any \\nconclusion but that the position [they]now [find themselves] in is the product of \\nmany antecedents. [Their own individual choices], which are major moral \\nfailings, are prominent among them but the blame to be assigned cannot be \\nwholly separated from the setting in which [each of them] made those choices and \\nthat setting cannot be separated from the history of systemic racism which has \\nplayed a part in shaping it [for both of them]. \\n \\n(iiv) Pre-sentence custody credit \\n[109] Chaves Patten was arrested on May 19, 2020, and charged accordingly. He was \\nreleased on bail on June 16, 2020.  On December 29, 2022, Mr. Patten was convicted \\non two Brampton charges and sentenced to 24 months in custody (in addition to pretrial \\ncustody since February 2022). He has remained in custody at Maplehurst Corrections \\nCentre in Milton since then. Based on serving two-thirds, the sentence on the two \\nBrampton charges would have allowed for a release date of approximately June of \\n2024. \\n \\n[110] Mr. Patten’s counsel and Crown counsel have agreed that Mr. Patten had 29 \\ndays of PTC at 1.5 credit for 44 days, plus 6 months credit for when he was on bail: a \\ntotal of 7 ½ months pre-trial credit. \\n \\n[111] The time that had been spent in pre-trial custody for Mr. James was a total of 97 \\ndays. Lockdown reports showed approximately 70% of his time in custody was spent on \\nlockdown. That would result in approximately 180 days being attributed to time spent in \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\ncustody for Mr. James. In addition, Crown counsel and counsel for Mr. James agree that \\nhe spent two years out of custody while on an ankle monitor and during that time – \\ninitially he was released on rather stringent conditions – total house arrest. Ultimately, he \\nwas able to do some work still on an ankle monitor, but the parties agree that six months \\nshould be credited for that time. In short, it appears, and I find that Mr. James is entitled \\nto have one year deducted from the sentence which I must soon impose upon him.  \\n7. Conclusions and ancillary orders \\n[112] As I have emphasized, sentencing is an individualized process, and my duty is to \\nimpose a sentence on Mr. Patten and a sentence on Mr. James that is just and appropriate \\nin each of their respective circumstances. After much thought, and before taking into \\naccount Summers or Downes credit, but after taking account of the circumstances of both \\nthe offence and both of these offenders, and the aggravating and mitigating circumstances \\nfor each of these offenders including Morris factors, I have concluded on the appropriate \\nsentences for each of them. \\n[113] Mr. Patten, please stand up.  \\n[114] Mr. Patten, I impose a sentence on you of a total of nine-years imprisonment. In \\nimposing this sentence of nine years I am following the decision in R. v. Brown and am \\naddressing individual deterrence and your good prospects for rehabilitation by imposing \\nthe shortest term of imprisonment that I find is proportionate to the crime and to your \\nresponsibility. \\nCount \\nOffence \\nSentence \\n2 \\nConspiracy to Commit Robbery (s. 465(1)) \\nStayed: R. v.

Mr. Patten, to serve a remaining sentence of eight years and four and one-\\nhalf months.  \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[116] Mr. James, please stand up.  \\n[117] Mr. James, you do not get the benefit of the principles that apply to a first-time \\noffender sentence. However, I am recognizing the difference in your participation in this \\noffence, your lesser moral culpability. That said, frankly, you should have been the one, \\nolder, and taking account of your prior record, and what you knew that entailed, who \\nshould have intervened and persuaded the others to abandon a silly plan, regardless of at \\nwhose instigation, Killa da Crook or whoever. \\n[118] You should have stood up as a person with a record to tell the others this was \\nfoolish and senseless. I do not know what the pressures were that you experienced at that \\ntime, but you failed your partner and your son by being the getaway driver in a plan that \\nyou knew better than to permit yourself to be involved in. I am unable to accept any \\nreasons for that failure, and none were offered. Had you had that moment of correct \\njudgment, based upon your own prior criminal experience, I venture that despite the \\nravings of Killa da Crook, none of this would have happened.   \\n[119] So, despite what I accept are your good prospects for rehabilitation, I have felt a \\nneed to impose a sentence higher than advocated for by your counsel. While less than the \\nCrown asks for, for all of these reasons, I have determined the fit global sentence to be \\n7.5 years.  \\nCount \\nOffence \\nCriminal Code Section \\n1 \\nConspiracy to Commit Robbery (465(1)) \\nStayed: R. v.

Pursuant to s. 487.051(1), I authorize the taking of the number of bodily \\nsamples reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis and historical \\nrecording. \\n \\n[123] Finally, were it not for the significant social context evidence of the very difficult \\nlife circumstances you have both experienced, and the very strong rehabilitation \\nprospects that the EPSR authors describe in their reports, I would have been less inclined \\nthan I have been in setting these sentences for you.  \\n \\n[124] I am thinking for you Mr. Patten, of the tragic loss of your father and the \\nexceptional hardships you and your mother had to bear in migrating to this country. \\nHopefully, the steps you have already taken in the process of rehabilitation will provide \\nyou with appropriate education and training that will enable you to achieve your goals. \\nThis sentence is the first step on that road. I am very hopeful for your future, but it is up \\nto you. \\n \\n[125] For you, Mr. James, I am thinking of your experience in being ripped away from \\nyour mother at six years of age. And neither of you had a strong male father figure in \\nyour lives, which the research shows likely contributed significantly to each of you taking \\nthe wrong path and ending out here in front of me today for sentencing.  \\n  \\n[126] Yet, your family and support group see great promise for you, for the potential to \\nbe a good person who can make the changes to your life that will be needed to keep you \\non the better path and away from criminal trouble. Once your sentence is completed, I as \\nwell hope you will be able to rebuild your life and become a greater man.  \\n \\nThank you. Those are my reasons for sentence. \\n \\n \\nOrder accordingly. \\n \\n \\nMichael G. Quigley \\nReleased:  \\nApril 2, 2024 \\n2024 ONSC 1737 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nCITATION: R v.

Section 14(3) and the Reverse Onus Provision .............................................................. 86 \\nConclusion and Disposition ...................................................................................................... 87 \\n \\n \\nOVERVIEW \\n \\n[1] \\nThe applicants and intervenors are animal rights activists.   They ask the court to \\nfind that a number of sections of the  Security from Trespass and Protecting Food \\nSafety Act,1(the “Act”) and the Regulation2  passed under it (the “Regulation”) \\nviolate their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,  and are \\nof no force or effect. \\n[2] \\nThe Act requires the consent of the owner or occupier for anyone to be  on certain \\ntypes of premises where animals are kept, raised or slaughtered (the “ agricultural \\npremises”).     \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020, SO 2020, c 9. \\n2 General, O Reg 701/20 \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n[3] \\nSection 5(6) of the Act provides that any consent to be on agricultural premises is \\nvoided if it was obtained under false pretences “in the prescribed circumstances.”  \\nSection 5(6) does not violate the applicants’ Charter rights.  There is nothing \\nunconstitutional as such about a provision that voids a consent that has been \\npreviously given.  The real issue is not so much about the fact that consents has \\nbeen voided as it is about the “prescribed circumstances” in which the consent is \\nvoided.  Those circumstances are set out in ss 9 and 10 of the Regulation.  \\n[4] \\nSection 9  of the Regulation, in effect,  makes it an offence to make any sort of \\nfalse statement to gain access to agricultural premises.  Section 10 makes it an \\noffence to claim one has qualifications one does not have to get a job on \\nagricultural premises.   \\n[5] \\nThe applicants say that s. 5(6) of the Act and ss 9 and 10 of the Regulation are \\ntargeted at animal rights activists who  obtain jobs at agricultural premises in order \\nto make videos showing how animals are treated.  Those videos are then posted \\nonline or shared with journalists.   \\n[6] \\nCandidates for jobs at such premises are asked questions during job interviews \\nthat are aimed at determining whether the person is affiliated with an animal rights \\ngroup.  Common questions are whether the candidate has a university degree or \\nis affiliated with an animal rights group.  To get the job, the activist must give a \\nfalse answer.  As a result, if they get the job, they have obtained consent to be on \\nthe premises by false pretences which voids the consent, turns them into \\ntrespassers and makes them subject to penalties under the Act.   The applicants \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nsubmit that this violates their right to freedom of expression under s. 2(b) of the \\nCharter.  \\n[7] \\nOntario submits that the Act is aimed at protecting animal safety, biosecurity, and \\nthe safety of farmers as well as preventing economic harm that can arise from \\nthreats to animal safety and biosecurity.  \\n[8] \\nOntario argues as well that the expression at issue is not protected by the Charter \\nbecause it occurs on private property and the Charter does not apply to private \\nproperty or private actors.  That misses an important nuance.  Although the right \\nof a property owner to remove someone from their property is not subject to review \\nunder the Charter, government restrictions on and penalties for expressing oneself \\nare.  Although the applicants do not have a positive right to use the property of \\nothers as a platform for their freedom of expression, that does not necessarily \\nmean that the state should be able to penalize people for saying certain things \\nwithout attracting Charter scrutiny.  Both ss 9 and 10 of the Regulation are \\ngovernment actions that limit freedom of expression.  Both are subject to review \\nunder the Charter.   \\n[9] \\nIn my view, s. 9 of the Regulation is overly broad and disproportionate.  It penalizes \\nmisstatements like denying affiliation with an animal rights group or having a \\nuniversity degree.  Those sorts of misstatements have no bearing on objectives \\nlike animal safety or food security.  Section 9 turns a person into an offender under \\nthe Act even though they are on the property with the owner’s consent and are \\ncarrying out the owner’s instructions on the property.  They are turned into an \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\noffender simply because, to use the example the applicants did, they denied \\nhaving a university degree or denied being associated with an animal rights \\norganization.  In addition, as a practical matter, a person would be charged under \\nthe act only if they tried to communicate what they saw on the agricultural \\npremises.  It is highly unlikely that anyone who got a job by making a false \\nstatement but who then was a model employee for the rest of their career and \\nnever communicated what they saw would be charged under the Act. \\n[10] \\nIn my view, s. 9 of the Regulation is not saved by s. 1 of the Charter.   \\n[11] \\nSection 10 of the Regulation is, in my view,  saved by s. 1 of the Charter.   Section \\n10 intrudes on freedom of expression only minimally.  It prohibits a person only \\nfrom claiming to have qualifications they do not in fact have.  That is a proportionate \\nresponse to the risks the Act seeks to control.  Exaggerating one’s qualifications \\ncan lead to serious harm for biosecurity and animal safety.   \\n[12] \\nThe applicants  also challenge ss 11 and 12 of the Regulation.  Those provisions \\nexempt journalists and whistleblowers from the application of ss 9 and 10 of the \\nRegulation.  The applicants say they should be struck out because they impose a \\nnumber of limitations on who is a whistleblower or journalist.  I find that some, but \\nnot all, of the provisions of ss 11 and 12 violate the Charter.   \\n[13] \\nThe second principal focus of the applicants’ challenge is to ss  5(4), 6(2) and 6(4) \\nof the Act.  Section  5(4) prohibits any person from interfering or interacting with a \\nfarm animal on agricultural premises without consent of the owner or occupier.  \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nSection 6(2) prohibits any person from interfering or interacting with a farm animal \\nbeing transported by a motor vehicle without the prior consent of the driver.  The \\napplicants submit that ss 5(4) and 6(2) infringe on their rights to freedom of \\nexpression under the Charter and that s. 6(2) also infringes on the applicants \\nfreedom of assembly under the Charter.   \\n[14] \\nI find that ss 5(4) and 6(2) do not violate freedom of expression or assembly as the \\napplicants submit.  Although interaction with animals is a form of expression, it is \\nnot protected by the Charter.  The Charter was never intended to give one person \\nthe right to physically interact with another person’s property without the other’s \\nconsent under the guise of freedom of expression.   \\n[15] \\nSection 6(4) of the Act voids  any consent given to interact with animals if such \\nconsent was obtained by false pretences in prescribed circumstances. Section 6(4) \\nof the Act does not infringe on the applicants’ Charter rights.  First, because the \\napplicants have no right to interact with another person’s property without the \\nowner’s consent.  Second, because  as with s. 5(6), the issue is not so much \\nvoiding consent as it is the circumstances in which consent is voided.  Those \\ncircumstances are addressed in ss 9-12 of the Regulation which have been \\naddressed above.    \\n[16] \\nFinally, the applicants challenge the powers of arrest and the reverse onus \\nprovisions in the Act as infringing on their right to life, liberty and security of the \\nperson, and their right to be presumed innocent under the Charter.  I am unable to \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\naccept that submission.  Similar provisions have been upheld in a long line of cases \\nby which I am bound and which it would be inappropriate to reverse. \\n[17] \\nIn the result, I declare s. 9  and certain provisions of ss 11 and 12 of the Regulation \\nto violate the right to freedom of expression under the Charter and that, subject to \\nthe comments in the conclusion of these reasons, I declare them to have no force \\nor effect.   \\nI. \\nBackground \\nA. The Parties \\n \\n[18] \\nThe applicant, Animal Justice, describes itself as Canada’s leading animal law \\norganization that works to strengthen animal protection laws, alert authorities to \\nanimal abuse, and inform the public about the treatment of animals used for food, \\nfashion, entertainment, and scientific research. Animal Justice relies on \\ninformation and footage obtained covertly about practices involving animal abuse.     \\n[19] \\nThe applicant Jessica Scott-Reid is a freelance journalist who reports regularly on \\nissues related to animal rights and welfare in Canada.  To report on how farmed \\nanimals are raised, slaughtered, and transported, she relies on firsthand \\ninformation and footage from others, such as employee whistleblowers, animal \\nadvocates, and individuals engaged in what the applicants and interveners refer \\nto as “bearing witness” near transport trucks outside of slaughterhouses.  \\n[20] \\nThe applicant Louise Jorgensen is a graphic artist and social media content creator \\nwith the Animal Save Movement. She endeavours to show the public how farmed \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nanimals are treated by documenting the animals themselves and the conditions in \\nwhich they are transported.  \\n[21] \\nThe applicants’ Charter challenge is supported by a number of interveners who \\nwere granted standing3 to make submissions.  They are the Centre for Free \\nExpression, Animal Alliance of Canada and the Regan Russell Foundation. \\n[22] \\nThe Centre for Free Expression describes itself as “a non-partisan research, public \\neducation, and advocacy centre” that advances the public’s right to see, receive \\nand share information. It is particularly involved in issues concerning the protection \\nand promotion of whistleblower rights.4   \\n[23] \\n The Animal Alliance of Canada describes itself as “a federally incorporated non-\\nprofit organization committed to the protection of all animals and to the promotion \\nof a harmonious relationship among humans, non-humans and the environment.5 \\n[24] \\nThe Regan Russell Foundation describes itself as a foundation that fosters \\npeaceful protest, freedom of speech, freedom of association, and public education, \\nparticularly regarding animal rights activism.6  It is named after Regan Russell, an \\nanimal rights activist who died on June 19, 2020 after being struck by a truck \\ntransporting livestock while she was protesting  outside a slaughterhouse.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n3 See Animal Justice et al v Attorney General of Ontario, 2023 ONSC 3147 \\n4 Animal Justice et al v Attorney General of Ontario, 2023 ONSC 3147 at para. 19. \\n5 Animal Justice et al v Attorney General of Ontario, 2023 ONSC 3147 at para. 28. \\n6 Animal Justice et al v Attorney General of Ontario, 2023 ONSC 3147 at para. 34. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\n[25] \\nFor ease of reference, I will refer to the applicants and the interveners collectively \\nas the applicants unless the context demands otherwise. \\nB. Factual Background \\n \\n[26] \\nThe Act was passed in 2020 in response to demands from the agricultural industry \\nand approximately 120 municipal resolutions calling on government to do more to \\ncontrol trespass onto agricultural properties. \\n[27] \\nThe application arises out of a debate about acceptable animal husbandry \\npractices.  That debate involves four contextual factors that have been raised in \\nthis application:  the increasing industrialization of animal husbandry, the nature of \\nanimal husbandry standards in Canada, the nature of accepted practices in \\nCanada, and the usefulness of undercover exposés. \\n[28] \\nTurning first to industrialization. The trend over the last few decades has been to \\nconsolidate animal husbandry into a smaller number of farms producing a larger \\nnumber of animals with fewer employees.  By way of example, in 1976 there were \\n18,622 pig farms in Canada.  In 2016 there were 2,760.  The average number of \\npigs on those farms has increased from 103 in 1976 to 1,280 in 2016.  The \\napplicants point to examples of farms with 1,200 pigs being run with seven \\nemployees and to farms with 10,000 turkeys being run with 15 employees.     The \\napplicants argue that raising animals is no longer about bucolic family farms but \\nabout highly mechanized industrial operations.  They note, for example, that at \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\npresent, approximately 240 million animals are slaughtered annually in Ontario.  \\nThe applicants say this proceeding has little, if anything to do with “family farms.”  \\nIn support of this they point to the evidence of Eric Schwindt, one of the \\nrespondent’s affiants and a former Chair of the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing \\nBoard, who, during cross-examination,  described a “family farm” as any farm that \\nis privately owned.   Thus, a family farm would include the farms owned by the \\nDutch multinational corporation that raises 90% of turkeys in Canada.  The \\napplicants submit that increased industrialization has led to increased production \\npressures which has led to a deterioration of animal welfare, all the more so given \\nthat staff at these facilities tend to be unskilled, entry-level positions with little \\ntraining. \\n[29] \\nThe second contextual factor is the nature and source of regulation of the livestock \\nindustry.  The current regulation for treatment of any animal in Ontario is the \\nProvincial Animal Welfare Services Act.7   Although one provision of that act makes \\nit an offence to cause an animal to be in distress, that provision does not apply to \\nanimal husbandry carried out in accordance with administrative requirements, or, \\nin the absence of administrative requirements,  carried out in accordance with \\nreasonable and generally accepted practices of agricultural animal care, \\nmanagement or husbandry.8  The applicants submit that this regime is ineffective \\nfor two reasons.  First, because those standards that do exist are voluntary and \\n                                                 \\n \\n7 Provincial Animal Welfare Services Act, 2019, S.O. 2019, c. 13. \\n8 Provincial Animal Welfare Services Act, 2019, S.O. 2019, c. 13 s. 15(1) and 15(4). \\n   \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nare developed primarily by industry representatives.  Second, because inspections \\noccur only in response to specific complaints.  There are no random, unannounced \\ninspections to ensure that relevant standards are being adhered to.  Even in the \\nface of a complaint, the target receives advance notice of any inspection as does \\nthe relevant commodity group, representatives of which are invited to attend the \\ninspection.  \\n[30] \\nThe third contextual factor involves the standards themselves.  The applicants \\npoint out that certain accepted practices in Canada would be illegal if applied to a \\npet and include practices that have been banned in jurisdictions like the U.K. and \\nthe EU.  These practices include castrating, docking tails and removing teeth of \\npiglets all without anaesthetic or analgesic; keeping chickens in cages so small \\nthat they cannot spread their wings; throwing live male chicks into meat grinders \\nto kill them; and keeping sows in gestation and farrowing crates that do not allow \\nthem to turn around. \\n[31] \\nOntario submits that such practices are necessary to reduce damage to livestock.  \\nIt says, for example, that piglet castration is required to avoid aggression in males \\nthat causes them to harm other pigs and to avoid an unpleasant taste known as \\nboar taint from affecting the meat.  Piglets’ tails are docked because pigs bite and \\nchew on each other’s tails causing infection.  Piglets’ teeth are removed to avoid \\ninjury to other pigs in cases of aggression.  Male chicks are killed because they \\nare not economically productive and become aggressive as they mature.  Sows \\nare kept in gestation crates because they are aggressive and hierarchical.  They \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\nfight and injure each other if not separated.  Sows are kept in farrowing crates to \\nprevent them from killing newborn piglets by inadvertently stepping or lying on \\nthem and to prevent more deliberate savaging behaviour by sows towards piglets.   \\n[32] \\nThe applicants reply that aggressive behaviours in animals can be reduced if they \\nare given adequate space and feeding arrangements that do not have them \\ncompete for food. \\n[33] \\nThe fourth contextual factor involves undercover exposés.  The applicants submit \\nthat the only way of bringing the conditions in which animals are raised to the public \\neye is through covert exposés; for the most part by individuals who seek \\nemployment for the purpose of recording the conditions in which animals are \\nraised.  The applicants submit that ordinary employees are not realistic sources of \\nsuch exposés because they are unskilled, entry-level employees, often immigrants \\nor migrants who are economically vulnerable and who cannot take the risk of \\nexposing the conditions they see. \\n[34] \\nThe applicants introduced several videos made by animal-rights groups at various \\nlivestock producers.  Some have been shown on news programs such as W5 and \\nthe CBC. Some have led to convictions against the livestock producers involved.  \\nThe applicants submit that the public exposure of even legal practices to which \\nanimals are subject fuels public debate, influences purchasing decisions and \\ncontributes to improvement in animal husbandry. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\n[35] \\nOntario argues that some of the applicants and interveners object to the use of \\nanimals for any purpose in the service of humans.  Ontario also submits that \\nagricultural practices are studied by academics and institutions around the world.  \\nThose studies involve determining what best practices are and how to improve \\nexisting practices.  As a result, argues Ontario, undercover exposés about \\nstandard practices are not necessary and are not conducive to informed public \\ndebate. \\n[36] \\nThat, however, does not necessarily end the discussion.  Studies by academics \\nand agricultural institutes are carried out in controlled environments, usually by \\nhighly trained technicians or scientists.  In day-to-day operations, the practices are \\nimplemented by unskilled, entry-level employees who receive relatively little \\ntraining.  A practice that may be humane in an academic environment when carried \\nout by scientists can be inhumane when implemented by untrained, unskilled \\nemployees who may be subject to pressures to process a certain number of \\nanimals in a certain period of time.   \\n[37] \\nBy way of example, “piglet thumping” arose as a practice in one of the videos \\nbefore me.  It is unclear on the record before me whether it is deemed to be an \\nacceptable practice.  In theory, it involves euthanizing a sick piglet by striking its \\nhead against a concrete surface.  One can envisage circumstances in which that \\nmay be humane if it is carried out to ensure that death is instant and that the animal \\nfeels no pain.  One can also envisage a myriad of circumstances in which it is \\ninhumane and causes needless suffering.  How, for example, does one ensure \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nthat an unskilled worker carries out the practice so the point of impact is precisely \\nwhere it leads to instant death?   How does one ensure that repeated efforts are \\nnot required to euthanize a particular animal?  The video of “piglet thumping” in the \\nrecord shows a piglet being picked up and thrown repeatedly onto a concrete floor \\nwithout any effort to ensure that the point of contact leads to instant death.    \\n[38] \\nIt may well be that the practices to which the applicants object are acceptable \\ngeneral practices.  Whether that is the case ultimately depends on social \\nconsensus around the issue.  The applicants argue that freedom of speech is \\ndesigned to bring issues like this into the open so that social consensus can \\ndevelop and evolve.   \\nC. Preliminary Issues \\n[39] \\nThere are two preliminary issues to address before turning to the applicants’ \\nchallenges. The first concerns the participation of the intervener, Regan Russell \\nFoundation.  Regan Russell was a protester who participated in demonstrations \\noutside slaughterhouses. She was killed in an accident involving a truck while \\ndoing so.  The Regan Russell Foundation was granted intervener status to make \\nsubmissions “on the issues defined in the application”.9  Some of its submissions \\nrelated to the circumstances of her death and the propriety of Ontario using her \\ndeath as the reason for bringing certain provisions of the Act into force earlier than \\ninitially anticipated.  Those submissions go beyond the issues defined in the \\n                                                 \\n \\n9 Animal Justice et al v Attorney General of Ontario, 2023 ONSC 3147 at para. 38. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\napplication and therefore go beyond the terms of the intervention.  As a result, I \\nwill not address those submissions or make any findings in that regard.  I note as \\nwell that the circumstances of Ms. Russell’s tragic death are the subject of other \\njudicial proceedings into which it would not be appropriate for me to stray.   \\n[40] \\nThe second preliminary issue concerns the admissibility of an affidavit that Ontario \\nfiled.  The affidavit is from Susan Fitzgerald.  It addresses biosecurity, safety \\nconcerns, animal welfare issues and the regulation of livestock transportation.  The \\napplicants object to the admissibility of her affidavit as that of an expert because \\nthey argue she lacks both expertise and independence.  The applicants note that \\nMs. Fitzgerald has no formal credentials or research papers with respect to the \\nissues to which she opines and has worked for agricultural associations for 35 \\nyears.  She is currently the Executive Director of the Ontario Livestock \\nTransporters Alliance. \\n[41] \\nThe evidence from Ms. Fitzgerald’s affidavit of which Ontario asks the court to take \\nnote is not controversial.  It consists of two points and two documents.  The two \\npoints are: the special importance of biosecurity and that the interior floors of trucks \\ncan become slippery if water is sprayed on them.  The two documents are a \\npublication of the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs entitled \\nBiosecurity Fundamentals for Visitors to Livestock Facilities and a report of the \\nStanding Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food of the House of Commons \\nentitled Mental Health: A Priority For Our Farmers.    No one contested the \\nauthenticity of those documents. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\n[42] \\nThe threshold for admissibility of an expert is low.10  The fact that an expert has \\nengaged in prior advocacy does not necessarily prevent admission of the report.11 \\nAn expert need not have obtained her expertise through formal credentials or \\npublications and can have achieved it through experience.  Ms. Fitzgerald appears \\nto have acquired her knowledge through experience, albeit through a particular \\nlens.  Whether the lens through which an expert views an issue deprives her of \\nindependence is better gauged through admission of the report and consideration \\nof the issue of independence in the context of the record as a whole rather than by \\nexcluding the report from the outset.   I therefore admit the report.  Given that the \\ntwo factual points on which Ms. Fitzgerald opines are not controversial and given \\nthat the reports she attaches are government documents the authenticity of which \\nis not contested, I accept those points and documents and need not make any \\nfurther findings about Ms. Fitzgerald’s alleged lack of independence. \\nII. \\nFreedom of Expression and False Pretences  \\nA. The Statutory Provision \\n[43] \\nSubsections 5(1) - (3) of the Act prohibit anyone from entering an “animal \\nprotection zone” of a farm, animal processing facility or other prescribed premises \\nwithout the prior consent of the owner or occupier of the premises.  “Animal \\n                                                 \\n \\n10 White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co., 2015 SCC 23, [2015] 2 SCR 182 at paras. 48-49. \\n11 Affleck v. The Attorney General of Ontario, 2021 ONSC 1108 at paras. 26-29. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\nProtection” zone is defined as, among other things, any area on which farm \\nanimals may be kept or located.12   \\n[44] \\nSubsection 5(6) provides:  \\n(6) For the purposes of subsections(1), (2), (3) and (4), \\nconsent to entering in or on an animal protection zone, \\nto interfering or interacting with farm animals or to carrying \\nout prescribed activities is invalid if it is obtained from the \\nowner or occupier of the relevant farm, animal processing \\nfacility or prescribed premises using duress or under false \\npretences in the prescribed circumstances or for the \\nprescribed reasons and a consent so obtained shall be \\ndeemed not to have been given. (Emphasis added) \\n \\n \\n[45] \\nI digress here momentarily to consider the Regulations under the Act.  As noted, \\ns. 5(6) of the Act vitiates consent obtained under false pretences “in the prescribed \\ncircumstances.”  The prescribed circumstances are contained in ss.  9 and 10 of \\nthe Regulation.  They will be discussed in greater detail later in these reasons.   \\nFor present purposes they can be summarized as follows:  Section 9 of the \\nRegulation considers consent to have been obtained under false pretences if a \\nperson makes a false statement to an owner or occupier of a facility as a result of \\nwhich the person receives consent to carry out an act that, without consent, would \\nbe prohibited under subsections 5(1) - (4) (i.e. entering an Animal Protection Zone \\nor interacting with animals in such a zone).  Section 10 of the Regulation deems \\n                                                 \\n \\n12 Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020, SO 2020, c 9, (the “Act”) s. 2. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\nconsent to have been given under false pretences if a person makes a false \\nstatement which suggests that they have qualifications that they do not have. \\n[46] \\nSections 11 and 12 of the Regulation exempt journalists and whistleblowers from \\nss 9 and 10 of the of the Regulation.  Ontario submits that the journalists and \\nwhistleblowers exemptions demonstrate that the Act is minimally impairing.  The \\napplicants submit that the journalists and whistleblower exemptions have \\nsignificant limitations which not only fail to make the Act minimally impairing but \\nwhich further infringe on freedom of expression.  Those provisions will be \\nconsidered in further detail when considering the concept of minimal impairment \\nlater in these reasons. \\n[47] \\nReturning to the Act, Section 14(1) makes it an offence to contravene specifically \\nenumerated sections of the Act including subsection 5(1) - (4).  The Act sets out \\nfines for a first offence of up to $15,000 and up to $25,000 for any subsequent \\noffences.13   \\n[48] \\nOntario first submits that obtaining consent by false pretences is not an offence \\nbecause s. 5(6) is not one of the sections the breach of which is listed as an offence \\nin s. 14(1).   In my view, Ontario has stopped reading too soon.   Section 14(2), in \\neffect, makes it an offence to have obtained access to the property by false \\npretences.  It provides: \\n                                                 \\n \\n13 Act s.  15(1) \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\nAny person who uses duress or false pretences in the \\nprescribed circumstances or for the prescribed reasons to \\nobtain the consent of the owner or occupier of a farm, \\nanimal processing facility or prescribed premises or the \\ndriver of a motor vehicle transporting farm animals, to do \\nanything that would otherwise be prohibited under \\nsubsection 5(1), (2), (3) or (4) or 6(2) is guilty of an \\noffence.  (Emphasis added) \\n \\n \\nIn essence, that means if one obtains consent by way of s.  5 (6) one is guilty of \\nan offence. \\n[49] \\nOntario then submits that if gaining access by false pretences is punishable under \\ns. 14(2), it is subject to a maximum fine of only $5,000 because the Act does not \\nprovide a penalty for using false pretences.  If no penalty for an offence is set out \\nin an Ontario statute, the offence is governed by the Provincial Offences Act14  \\nwhich limits fines to $5,000. \\n[50] \\nI do not entirely agree with that submission either.  Given that the owner’s consent \\nhas been vitiated by the false pretences, the person would be in violation of ss. \\n5(1) to 5(4).   If anything, the person could be subject to two fines: one of up to \\n$5,000 for the false pretence and another of up to $25,000 for being on premises \\nwithout consent.  \\n[51] \\nThe applicants say these provisions will put an end to undercover exposés \\nbecause the people who seek jobs to expose abuses must usually misrepresent \\nthemselves during a job interview in order to be hired.  Employment candidates \\n                                                 \\n \\n14 Provincial Offences Act, RSO 1990, c P.33 \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\nwould typically be asked questions during an interview to determine whether they \\nare affiliated with animal rights organizations.  The question can be as direct as \\nwhether they are affiliated with any such organization or as oblique as whether \\nthey have a university degree, the assumption apparently being that no one with a \\nuniversity degree would want such a job unless they intended to conduct an \\nundercover exposé.  The applicants further submit that most people who conduct \\nexposés are of modest means and could not afford the risk of being found liable \\nunder the Act as a result of which such exposés would end.   \\n[52] \\nOf the statutory provisions related to s.  5 of the Act, the applicants seek a \\ndeclaration that ss 5(4), 5(6),  and 14(2) of the Act and ss 9 – 12 of the Regulation \\ninfringe one or both of ss 2(b) and 2(c) of the  Charter in a manner that cannot be \\nsaved under s.  1 of the Charter and are therefore of no force and effect. \\nB. Does Section 5 Restrain Freedom of Expression? \\n \\n[53] \\nTo determine whether government action infringes on freedom of expression under \\ns. 2(b) of the Charter the court must ask itself three questions: \\ni. Does the communication have expressive content? \\nii. If so, does the method or location of this expression remove the \\nprotection? \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\niii. If the expression is protected by s. 2(b), does the government action \\ninfringe on that protection either in purpose or effect?15 \\ni. \\nExpressive Content \\n[54] \\nAll expressive activity is presumptively protected by s.  2(b).16  Whether the \\nexpressive content has sufficient merit to warrant protection is usually decided in \\nthe s. 1 inquiry, if one is needed, and not when determining whether the \\ncommunication has expressive content.  The false pretence is clearly expressive \\nactivity.   \\n[55] \\nOntario tries to avoid the expressive content  branch of the test by characterizing \\nthe applicants’ challenge as a “positive rights” claim in which the applicants seek \\na right to access private property to conduct undercover exposés; a right they do \\nnot otherwise have.  In support of that submission, Ontario cites the Supreme \\nCourt of Canada’s distinction between a positive or negative rights claim in the \\nToronto v. Ontario17 as follows: \\nFurther, and of particular significance to this appeal, s. 2(b) \\nhas been interpreted as “generally impos[ing] a negative \\nobligation . . . rather than a positive obligation of protection \\nor assistance”.   A claim is properly characterized as \\nnegative where the claimant seeks “freedom from \\ngovernment legislation or action suppressing an expressive \\nactivity in which people would otherwise be free to \\nengage”.18 \\n \\n                                                 \\n \\n15 Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc., 2005 SCC 62, [2005] 3 SCR 141 at para. 56. \\n16 Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc., 2005 SCC 62, [2005] 3 SCR 141 at para. 58. \\n17 Toronto (City) v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2021 SCC 34 \\n18 Toronto (City) v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2021 SCC 34 at para. 16. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\n[56] \\nOntario argues that the applicants are not otherwise free to engage in trespass or \\ninterfere with private property, as a result of which, punishing those activities does \\nnot infringe on freedom of expression.   \\n[57] \\nOntario also characterizes the application as a claim for a right to information and \\nargues that government conduct that makes it more difficult to obtain information \\ndoes not necessarily violate freedom of expression.  In addition, Ontario argues \\nthat any right to information is restricted to information from government and does \\nnot extend to information from private parties.19 \\n[58] \\nI do not accept those characterizations.  In my view, Ontario’s argument in this \\nregard conflates the concept of trespass that is prohibited in s. 5(1) to 5(3) with the \\nprohibition on false pretences in s. 5(6).  The applicants do not challenge ss. 5(1) \\nto 5(3).  They do not challenge an owner or occupier’s right to prevent someone \\nfrom accessing their property without consent.  What the applicants challenge is \\nthe prohibition on seeking employment by false pretences.  \\n[59] \\nTo use the language of City of Toronto, while people are not “otherwise free to \\nengage in” trespass, they are otherwise free to gain entry to other premises by \\nusing false pretences without punishment by the state. The state does not penalize \\nor brand as trespassers people who exaggerate their passion for a particular \\n                                                 \\n \\n19 Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers\\' Association, 2010 SCC 23 at para. 30-31. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\nindustry in a job interview or who get into a bar by claiming to be 19 when they are \\nnot.  It is the penalization of the false pretence the applicants object to.   \\n \\n \\nii. \\nDoes the Location of the Expression Remove Charter Protection \\n \\n[60] \\nOntario submits that the expression at issue here occurs on private property and \\nis therefore immune from Charter protection.  In support, Ontario points to the \\nSupreme Court of Canada’s statement in Committee for the Commonwealth of \\nCanada v. Canada20 that: \\nFreedom of expression does not, historically, imply freedom \\nto express oneself wherever one pleases.  Freedom of \\nexpression does not automatically comport freedom of \\nforum.  For example, it has not historically conferred a right \\nto use another\\'s private property as a forum for expression.   \\nA proprietor has had the right to determine who uses his or \\nher property and for what purpose.   Moreover, the Charter \\ndoes not extend to private actions.  It is therefore clear that \\ns. 2(b) confers no right to use private property as a forum for \\nexpression.21 \\n \\n \\n[61] \\nOntario notes that the Supreme Court more recently affirmed the same proposition \\nin Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc. 22 when it directed courts to consider \\nwhether the location of the expression removes it from the protection of s.  2(b) of \\nthe Charter.   \\n                                                 \\n \\n20 Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v.

The Supreme \\nCourt added an important nuance in this regard in City of Montreal (City) v. 2952-\\n1366 Québec Inc., when it said: \\nSection 2(b) protection does not extend to all places.  Private \\nproperty, for example, will fall outside the protected sphere \\nof s. 2(b) absent state-imposed limits on expression, \\nsince state action is necessary to implicate the Canadian \\nCharter.23 (emphasis added) \\n \\n[63] \\nIt is the state-imposed limit on expression that is at issue here.  The applicants do \\nnot assert a right to compel the agricultural industry to allow them to use their \\nproperty as a forum from which to speak.  They challenge the “state imposed limit \\non expression” in s. 5(6) and the penalization of that expression in 14(2) of the act. \\n[64] \\nThe Act penalizes a private statement made by one person to another.  The simple \\nfact that the statement is made on private property should not excuse the \\ngovernment’s penal sanction from Charter scrutiny.  If it did, it would just as easily \\nenable the state to penalize what private citizens say to each other on any private \\nproperty, including their own homes.  I was not taken to any other circumstance in \\nwhich the state punishes people for what they tell others in a private conversation \\nabsent criminal conduct like fraud, assault, harassment, hate speech or the like. \\n                                                 \\n \\n23 Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc., 2005 SCC 62, [2005] 3 SCR 141 at para. 62 \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 26 \\n \\n \\n[65] \\nIn City of Montreal, the Supreme Court held that courts should ask themselves two \\nquestions to determine whether the location of the expression removes it from the \\nprotection of s.  2(b): (i) Are the actual or historical functions of the place ones that \\nattract freedom of expression? (ii) Would freedom of expression in the place at \\nissue undermine the values the guarantee is designed to promote,\" namely \\ndemocratic discourse, truth finding and self-fulfillment.24  With the second question \\nbeing the “ultimate question.”25 \\n[66] \\nAlthough it is not the function of a workplace to act as a forum for free expression, \\nall that means is that the speaker could not object if the employer/owner had the \\nspeaker removed from the premises if the employer/owner did not agree to the \\nexpression at issue.  It has also, however, never been the historical function of a \\nworkplace to be the subject of state restrictions about what one can or cannot say \\nthere, save, as noted, for criminal or quasi-criminal conduct.   \\n[67] \\nThe fact that an animal rights activist wants to obtain a job in a particular facility to \\ndescribe to the public the conditions to which animals are subject in that facility \\ndoes not undermine the values that freedom of expression is designed to promote.  \\nIf anything, it provides the public with information on an issue of interest to at least \\nsome members of the public.  Although the applicants have no positive right to use \\nagricultural facilities as a platform for their freedom of speech that does not \\n                                                 \\n \\n24 Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc., 2005 SCC 62, [2005] 3 SCR 141 at paras. 74-77. \\n25 Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc., 2005 SCC 62, [2005] 3 SCR 141 at para. 77. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 27 \\n \\n \\nnecessarily mean that the state should be able to penalize individuals for making \\ncertain types of statements without attracting Charter scrutiny. \\n[68] \\nOntario argues that it is not legal to obtain employment with one employer in order \\nto spy on that employer on behalf of a different employer.    Ontario points out that \\nsuch conduct can amount to breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, deceit, \\ntrespass and intrusion on seclusion.  This, says Ontario, is what undercover \\nemployees are doing.  They are employees of an animal rights group using \\ndeception to be hired by the facility in order to spy on the facility for the benefit of \\nthe animal rights group.  Once again, the difference is that those torts do not \\ninvolve government action restraining freedom of expression.  They involve private \\ncivil conduct to which the Charter does not apply. \\n[69] \\nOntario notes as well that any property owner has an absolute right to decide who \\nis allowed to remain on his or her property without regard to natural justice or being \\nobliged to give any reason for asking the intruder to leave.26  That too, is not at \\nissue here.  The employer of an undercover activist has the right to terminate \\nperson’s employment and has the right to ask the person to leave the premises \\nimmediately just as an employer has that right with any other employee. \\n[70] \\nPutting a slightly different characterization on the owner’s right to control access \\nto premises, Ontario argues that the Act prohibits unlawful trespass, and is not \\ntargeted at speech.  That is a somewhat circular argument though.  The speaker’s \\n                                                 \\n \\n26 Russo v. Ontario Jockey Club (Ont. H.C.J.), 1987 CanLII 4356.   \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 28 \\n \\n \\npresence on the property only becomes unlawful because the Act makes it so by \\nvirtue of the statement the person made.  In the scenario under discussion, the \\nemployee is on the property with the owner’s consent.  The employer wants the \\nemployee to be there every day to carry out their job duties.  Except for \\nsurreptitious recordings or other communications about what the employee sees, \\neverything the employee does, including interaction with animals, is with the \\nemployer’s consent.  Indeed it is at the employer’s direction.  The employee only \\nbecomes a trespasser because they have denied receiving a university degree or \\nhave denied affiliation with an animal rights group.  It is that expression that makes \\nthem a trespasser. \\n[71] \\nFinally, Ontario argues that extending s. 2(b) protection here would allow others to \\nuse deception to gain access to other private property to record what occurs there, \\nincluding venues like abortion clinics, retirement homes and hospitals.  Ontario \\nnotes that American courts have rejected such claims.27  I do not find that argument \\npersuasive.   \\n[72] \\nAs the Supreme Court noted in City of Montreal, the separation between spaces \\nwhere free speech is permitted and where it is not permitted will inevitably be \\nsubject to some imprecision that must be resolved case by case.28  Just where to \\n                                                 \\n \\n27 Armes v City of Philadelphia, 706 F Supp 1156 (1989) (US District Ct, ED Penn); Madsen v Women’s Health \\nCentre, Inc, 512 US 753 (1994) (USSC); Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v Newman (Court of \\nAppeals, 9th Circuit, 2022 \\n28 Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc., 2005 SCC 62 , [2005] 3 SCR 141 at para. 78. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 29 \\n \\n \\ndraw the line in any individual case may be influenced by factors such as the nature \\nof:  the restriction, the place and the expression. \\n[73] \\nAt least at the first level of analysis, the restriction here is the government’s \\npenalization of a statement that one person makes to another in private.   Even if \\none extends the analysis beyond the initial misrepresentation that helped get the \\njob to the activist recording the way animals are raised or slaughtered; that \\nrecording does not give rise to privacy interests of the same nature or degree as \\nwould recording the internal operations of abortion clinics, hospitals or retirement \\nhomes.   \\n[74] \\nFinally, the interpretive tendency in Canadian jurisprudence has been to give \\nCharter rights a large and liberal interpretation29  and to analyse the legitimacy of \\nany limitations when considering whether the infringement is demonstrably \\njustified in a free and democratic society under s 1 of the Charter.  Although that \\ndoes not relieve the court of the obligation to determine whether the location of the \\nexpression attracts the protection of s.  2(b), it does suggest courts should not be \\noverly hasty to exclude Charter protection  when dealing with more ambiguous \\ncases.   \\n \\n                                                 \\n \\n29 See for example Irwin Toy Ltd. v.

They seek to tell the public about the conditions in which animals are \\nraised and slaughtered.  They do so to bring about social and political change.  \\nThey do so in the pursuit of self-fulfillment. \\n                                                 \\n \\n30 Irwin Toy Ltd. v.

It is also important to take into account in this \\nregard that Scott Duff, the civil servant charged with passage of the Act and the \\nRegulation, agreed on cross-examination that the impetus behind s. 5(6) of the Act \\nwas to limit undercover investigations.35     \\n                                                 \\n \\n32 R v National Post, 2010 SCC 16, at para. 28. \\n33 R v National Post, 2010 SCC 16, at para 28. \\n34 Irwin Toy Ltd. v.

If the government\\'s purpose is to restrict a form \\nof expression in order to control access by others to the \\nmeaning being conveyed or to control the ability of the one \\nconveying the meaning to do so, it also limits the \\nguarantee.36   \\n  \\n[82] \\nThe Act penalizes misrepresentations that lead to access to certain premises.  \\nThat singles out meanings that are not to be conveyed.  If one accepts the \\nevidence of Scott Duff, the Act also seeks to restrict a form of expression by \\neliminating undercover exposés.  That singles out a further meaning that is not to \\nbe conveyed and controls the ability to convey a meaning. \\n[83] \\nQuite apart from the purpose of the Act, s. 5(6) and 14(2) have the effect of limiting \\nfreedom of expression in two ways.  First, they restrict what a potential employee \\ncan tell an employer without being penalized.  Second, the applicants have testified \\nthat they will no longer carry out undercover exposés in light of the penalties \\nassociated with them.    Both effects restrict expression.      \\n[84] \\n Ontario submits that these effects do not limit the applicants’ freedom of \\nexpression.  They remain free to advocate about animal husbandry practices as \\nthey wish without making false statements to owners or occupiers of agricultural \\npremises.  While that may be the case, courts have recognized that some modes \\n                                                 \\n \\n36 Irwin Toy Ltd. v.

Niagara \\nParks Police,37 the Ontario Court of Appeal noted: \\n… Over some range of cases at least, the medium is the \\nmessage. Tone of voice, volume, facial expressions and \\nbody language all convey meaning that cannot necessarily \\nbe conveyed effectively in words. The exercise of free \\nexpression is diminished by restrictions on the means that \\nmake it effective. So, it is no answer for the respondent to \\nsay there is no limit on one\\'s exercise of freedom of \\nexpression -- that everyone is free to convey whatever ideas \\nthey want -- provided they use appropriately temperate \\nlanguage. To take a familiar example from U.S. First \\nAmendment case law, the meaning conveyed by shouting \\n\"fuck the draft\" does not translate, without significant loss of \\nmeaning, to the quiet declaration, \"I am implacably opposed \\nto the draft\": Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15(1971).38 \\n \\n \\n[85] \\nSimilarly, here, the Act limits the mode of expression by preventing undercover \\nexposés or even eyewitness descriptions of the conditions in which animals are \\nraised or slaughtered if the person providing the description gained access to \\npremises using false pretences.   \\n[86] \\nIn light of the foregoing, I find that one of the purposes and one of the effects of \\nthe Act and the Regulation is to infringe on the applicants’ freedom of expression.   \\n  \\n                                                 \\n \\n37 Bracken v.

Is Section 5(6) Saved by Section 1 of the Charter? \\n \\n[87] \\nSection 1 of the Charter provides that its rights and freedoms are “subject only to \\nsuch reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free \\nand democratic society.”  This requires the government to demonstrate that the \\nAct and the Regulation: (i) further a pressing and substantial objective; (ii) are \\nrationally connected to the objective; (iii) minimally impair the right at issue; and \\n(iv) are proportionate in that they result in benefits that outweigh their deleterious \\neffects.39 \\ni. Pressing and Substantial Objective \\n[88] \\nSection 1 of the Act sets out its purposes as follows: \\nThe purposes of this Act are to prohibit trespassing on farms \\nand other properties on which farm animals are located and \\nto prohibit other interferences with farm animals in order to,  \\n \\n(a) eliminate or reduce the unique risks that are created \\nwhen individuals trespass on those properties or interfere \\nwith farm animals, including the risk of exposing farm \\nanimals to disease and stress as well as the risk of \\nintroducing contaminants into the food supply; \\n \\n(b) protect farm animals and the food supply chain from the \\nrisks described in clause (a);  \\n \\n(c) protect the safety of farmers, their families and persons \\nworking in or on farms, animal processing facilities and \\nprescribed premises as well as the safety of drivers of motor \\nvehicles transporting farm animals; and  \\n \\n                                                 \\n \\n39 R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 35 \\n \\n \\n(d) prevent any adverse effects the risks described in clause \\n(a) may have on Ontario\\'s overall economy. \\n \\n \\n[89] \\nThe objectives then are preventing trespass, protecting animal safety,  protecting \\nbiosecurity of the food supply chain, protecting those working with animals and \\npreventing the adverse economic effects that these risks can create.  \\n[90] \\nI accept that those are pressing and substantial objectives of government.    \\n \\nii.   \\nRational Connection \\n \\n[91] \\nUnder this branch of the test the government must demonstrate that there is a \\nrational connection between the impugned provisions and the purposes of the Act.   \\n[92] \\nThe onus is on the government to demonstrate rational connection.  It has been \\ndescribed as a “not particularly onerous” burden.40 \\n[93] \\nOntario points to the potentially devastating impact of biosecurity threats on \\nlivestock and the economy.  Ontario notes that a single case of mad cow disease \\nin Alberta led to a 33% plunge in Canadian farm cash receipts from cattle in 2003.  \\nIntroduction of a disease can require quarantine or culling an entire herd or flock.  \\nA spread of the disease from one farm to another can cause an entire region of \\n                                                 \\n \\n40 Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v Canada (Minister of Justice), 2000 SCC 69, at para.228.  \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 36 \\n \\n \\nfarms to be shut down.   Recent outbreaks of Avian Flu, for example, have affected \\nmillions of Canadian poultry flocks.   \\n[94] \\nIn addition to massive herd losses, disease can cause export markets to close and \\nresult in substantial losses.  By way of example, Ontario notes that its pork industry \\nmarkets 5.8 million hogs yearly, has created over 15,000 full-time equivalent jobs \\nand generates economic value of $2.7 billion per year.  Approximately 60% of pork \\nsales are to foreign markets.    \\n[95] \\nOntario argues that trespassers on farms or people who interact with animals in \\ntransport trucks do not understand and do not follow biosecurity protocols.   Videos \\nto which I was directed show trespassers not wearing (or constantly removing) \\nmasks, not wearing farm-dedicated clothing or shoes, and not changing their \\nclothes and shoes when moving from one area to another (as is often required by \\nbiosecurity protocols).  In one example, trespassers took close-range photos of \\ndeadstock bins before moving to other areas of the farm. This poses a significant \\nrisk of pathogen spread. Deadstock is legally required to be segregated.  In this \\ncontext I am using the term trespasser in the sense of someone who has broken \\ninto an animal protection zone without colour of right and not to people who have \\nbeen hired as employees but who have the personal objective of conducting an \\nundercover exposé.  \\n[96] \\nIn my view there is a rational connection between the purposes the Act is designed \\nto further and at least some of the situations to which ss 5(6) and 14(2) of the Act \\nare designed to apply.   \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 37 \\n \\n \\niii.  \\nMinimal Impairment  \\n \\n \\n[97] \\nThe third branch of the test to determine whether government conduct falls within \\ns. 1 of the Charter requires the government to demonstrate that the means adopted \\nto further the objective infringe rights as little as possible.  The minimal impairment \\nstage calls on the court to ask “whether the limit on the right is reasonably tailored \\nto the pressing and substantial goal put forward to justify the limit.”41  Under this \\nbranch of the test, the court must be satisfied that there is no alternative method \\nthat would advance the Act’s objectives that restricts rights less than the Act does.   \\n \\n[98] \\nLegislatures are not held to a standard of perfection, but rather are accorded \\nleeway in the tailoring process.42   Legislatures must, however, adopt  measures \\nthat fall within a range of reasonable alternatives.”43 \\n \\n[99] \\nOntario argues that the Act is reasonably tailored and impairs rights minimally \\nbecause it protects the rights of bona fide employees who act as whistleblowers \\nand because it protects the rights of journalists.   \\n \\n                                                 \\n \\n41 Alberta v Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37 at para. 53.   \\n42 RJR-MacDonald Inc v Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 SCR 199 at para. 160.; Alberta v Hutterian Brethren \\nof Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37 at para. 54.  \\n43 Mounted Police Association of Ontario v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 1 at para. 149.   \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 38 \\n \\n \\n[100] In my view Ontario has not satisfied the minimal impairment test.  I arrive at this \\nconclusion for three reasons.   First, the restrictions on expression are not \\nreasonably tailored when compared to the purposes of the Act.  Second, and third, \\nthe whistleblower and journalist exceptions are defined in an unnecessarily narrow \\nfashion which restrict freedom of expression more than necessary. \\n \\na. Restrictions are Not Reasonably Tailored to Objectives \\n \\n[101] Ontario says it introduced the Act in response to over 900 letters from farmers, \\nagricultural businesses and agricultural organizations and approximately 120 \\nmunicipal council resolutions requesting the government to better protect the \\nagricultural industry from “agricultural based trespass.”44   \\n[102] The evidence to which Ontario took me to justify the Act did not relate to people \\nwho gained access to agricultural facilities under false pretences, but related to \\nthose who gained access by breaking and entering into premises, accessed \\nanimals and in some cases released or stole animals.  Neither the applicants nor \\nthe interveners participate in such conduct, nor do they defend it.   The Act’s \\nprovisions that address this sort of conduct are not at issue in this proceeding.   \\n[103] The main provision that is being impugned is s.  5(6).  I repeat it here for \\nconvenience: \\n                                                 \\n \\n44 Affidavit of Scott Duff affirmed December 6, 2021, at para. 5-7. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 39 \\n \\n \\nFor the purposes of subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4), consent \\nto entering in or on an animal protection zone, to interfering \\nor interacting with farm animals or to carrying out prescribed \\nactivities is invalid if it is obtained from the owner or occupier \\nof the relevant farm, animal processing facility or prescribed \\npremises using duress or under false pretences in the \\nprescribed circumstances or for the prescribed reasons and \\na consent so obtained shall be deemed not to have been \\ngiven.   \\n \\n[104] There are three triggers that activate s. 5(6).  The first is entry into an animal \\nprotection zone.  Animal protections zone is broadly  defined to include an \\nenclosure for farm animals, whether or not it is marked as an animal protection \\nzone.45  The second trigger is that consent to enter an animal protection zone is \\ninvalid if it is obtained from the owner or occupier of the prescribed premises under \\nfalse pretences.  Prescribed premises is broadly defined in the Regulation to \\ninclude premises on which farm animals “are ordinarily bought and sold” and \\n“premises at which farm animals are displayed for public viewing.”46  The third \\ntrigger is that consent is deemed not to have been given if it was be obtained under \\nfalse pretences in the “prescribed circumstances or for the prescribed reasons.”  \\nThose prescriptions are found in the ss 9 and 10 of the Regulation.   \\n[105] I turn first to s.  10 of the Regulation which is, in my view, minimally impairing.  \\nSection 10 provides that a consent is considered to have been given under false \\npretences for the purposes of s. 5(6) of the Act if the false statement “expresses \\nor implies that the person possesses the qualifications necessary to carry out the \\n                                                 \\n \\n45 Act s. 2. \\n46 Regulation, s.  6.1 and 6.2 \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 40 \\n \\n \\nemployment in a manner that would not cause harm to” animals, food safety or to \\nan individual “when in fact the person does not possess those qualifications.”   \\nSection 10 focuses on misstatements that are directly related to the articulated \\npurposes of the Act of protecting animal safety,  protecting biosecurity, protecting \\nthose working with animals and preventing adverse economic effects that these \\nrisks can cause.  Pretending to have qualifications one does not have creates a \\npotential threat with respect to these concerns.  As a result, s. 10 of the Regulation \\nis reasonably tailored to the Act’s objectives.  \\n[106] Section 9 of the Regulation is, in my view, not minimally impairing and goes further \\nthan necessary to advance the avowed purposes of the Act.  It provides: \\nFalse statement resulting in contravention of Act \\n \\n9.  A person who gives a false statement to the owner or \\noccupier of a farm, animal processing facility or prescribed \\npremises or to the driver of a motor vehicle transporting farm \\nanimals and who obtains the consent of the owner, occupier \\nor driver to carry out an act that, without the consent, is \\nprohibited under subsection 5(1), (2), (3) or (4) or 6(2) of \\nthe Act, is considered to have obtained the consent under \\nfalse pretences for the purposes of subsections \\n5(6), 6(4) and 14(2) of the Act if, \\n \\n(a) the statement is made either orally or in writing; \\n \\n(b) the false statement is given for the purpose of obtaining \\nthe consent; \\n \\n(c) the owner, occupier or driver provides the consent in \\nreliance on the false statement; and \\n \\n(d) as a result of the consent being given, the person making \\nthe statement carries out an act that would otherwise be \\nprohibited under the Act. \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 41 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[107] In other words, if a person makes any sort of false statement to gain entry onto a \\nfarm, animal processing facility or prescribed premises, the person turns into a \\ntrespasser even though the owner or occupier was otherwise content to have the \\nperson on the premises.  This occurs by virtue of s. 5(6) which deems consent not \\nto have been given in those circumstances.    \\n[108] Thus, an undercover activist who obtains a job at a farm, animal processing facility \\nor prescribed premises by denying any affiliation with an animal rights group or by \\nunderstating their qualifications and denying that they have a university degree \\nautomatically becomes a trespasser although they have done nothing to increase \\nany of the risks that the Act is aimed at reducing.  The person could in fact be a \\nmodel employee who has adhered to all biosecurity protocols, treated animals with \\nthe highest degree of care and ensured the safety of their co-workers.       \\n[109] Recall also that “prescribed premises” is defined as including places where \\nanimals are ordinarily bought and sold, or places in which animals are displayed \\nfor public viewing.  This would include petting zoos, rodeos, fairs and circuses.  \\nThere was no evidence or explanation led about how a false statement to gain \\nentry into an auction, petting zoo, rodeo or circus creates a risk to food security, \\nanimal safety or human safety any more than does the presence of people who \\ndid not make a false statement to gain entry.   In these contexts, s.  9 of the \\nRegulation is not reasonably tailored or minimally impairing.  It turns into \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 42 \\n \\n \\ntrespassers a broad swath of individuals who create no risk in relation to any of the \\nAct’s avowed objectives.  \\n  \\nb.  The Whistleblower Exception \\n[110] Ontario submits that the Act and Regulation are minimally impairing and \\nreasonably tailored to its objectives because s.  12 of the Regulation creates an \\nexemption for whistleblowers.  Section 12 of the Regulation provides that, despite \\nss 9 and 10 of the Regulation, a person who gave a false statement shall not be \\nconsidered to have obtained consent under false pretences if the circumstances \\nset out in s. 12 of the Regulation apply.   \\n[111] The applicants submit that s. 12 of the Regulation contains four provisions that not \\nonly do not make the Act minimally impairing but which further contribute to the \\nAct’s infringement on freedom of expression.    \\n[112] The first limitation is found in s. 12(1)(c) of the Regulation which restricts the \\nwhistleblower exemption to a person who, as a result of the false statement:  \\nwas able to obtain information or evidence of harm to a farm \\nanimal, harm with respect to food safety or harm to an \\nindividual,  or another illegal activity, being carried out on a \\nfarm, animal processing facility or prescribed premises … \\n(emphasis added) \\n \\n \\n[113] The qualifier “or another illegal activity” in this clause suggests that the evidence \\nof harm to a farm animal that the whistleblower finds must amount to “illegal \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 43 \\n \\n \\nactivity” to fall within the exemption.  Thus, if the whistleblower were to find \\nevidence of piglet thumping,47 castration without anaesthetic or analgesic or \\nthrowing live chicks into a meat grinder, those would not amount to illegal activities \\nand the person would not enjoy the benefit of the whistleblower exemption.  Put \\nanother way, the provision has the effect of allowing communication about illegal \\nactivity but not allowing communication about legal activity.  This has further \\nrestrictive consequences for freedom of expression. \\n[114] The provision requires each individual to determine in advance whether the \\npractice about which they are communicating is illegal.  This means that the \\nwhistleblower will now be required to engage in a legal analysis about what is \\nclearly a highly nuanced issue before knowing whether their exercise of speech \\nwill be punishable by law.  By way of example, although I heard three days of \\nargument, I am unclear whether piglet thumping is a generally accepted practice \\nand therefore legal, or not.    In addition, the uninitiated layperson may well believe \\nthat throwing a live chick into a meat grinder amounts to illegal conduct when in \\nfact it appears to be legal.  I hasten to add that I am not saying that throwing live \\nchicks into a grinder is necessarily cruel or that it should be illegal.  Although it \\nsounds cruel at first blush, it may well be a form of euthanizing chicks that is instant \\nand painless.  That issue is not before me.  I use these examples only to \\ndemonstrate how nuanced the issue of legality is in the circumstances that the Act \\naddresses.  The Regulation puts employees into an untenable position by requiring \\n                                                 \\n \\n47 Assuming it is a generally accepted practice. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 44 \\n \\n \\ninstant and correct decisions about legality before they communicate something \\nwhen the circumstances in which they find themselves are fraught with nuance and \\nlack of guidance. \\n \\n[115] The second limitation is found in s.  12(1)(d) of the Regulation which provides that \\nthe whistleblower exemption only applies if the person who gave the false \\nstatement discloses the information they found to a police officer or other authority \\n“as soon as practicable after obtaining the information or evidence.”  In other \\nwords, any delay in providing the information to a police officer or other authority \\nremoves the whistleblower exemption.  As a result, any whistleblower would be \\nrestricted to recording and disclosing only a single act or perhaps a single day of \\nacts or risk being subject to prosecution.  This prevents whistleblowers from \\nrecording systemic patterns of abuse or wrongdoing.  The applicants argue that \\nthis makes it relatively easy for an individual facility to dismiss a whistleblowing \\nincident as a one time, unfortunate mishap involving a single bad actor when in \\nfact it may disclose a regular practice or systemic weaknesses in the facility’s \\ntraining or oversight of employees.    \\n \\n[116] This second limitation also compels disclosure to a governmental authority.  Rather \\nthan being minimally impairing, this provision creates a further infringement on \\nfreedom of expression because s. 2(b) of the Charter protects the right to say \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 45 \\n \\n \\nnothing.48 In McAteer v Canada (Attorney General),49 the Ontario Court of Appeal \\nposed three questions to determine if government action amounts to compelled \\nspeech contrary to s. 2(b) of the Charter: \\na. Is the compelled activity expression? \\nb. Is the purpose of the law aimed at controlling expression? If it is, then it is \\nautomatically held to be a violation of s. 2(b).  \\nc. If the purpose is not aimed at controlling expression, then the applicant must \\nshow the law has an adverse effect on expression, and that effect is worthy \\nof constitutional disapprobation.50 \\n[117] Answering these three questions, both sides agree that reporting to the police \\namounts to expression.  The stated purpose of the Act, on its face, does not relate \\nto the control of expression.  Mr. Duff’s evidence suggests that one purpose of the \\nAct is to control undercover exposés.  Regardless of the potential dispute over \\npurpose, the Act does have an adverse effect on expression.  The Act controls \\nboth the nature of the expression by compelling reporting to police or governmental \\nauthority and the timing of that expression by compelling disclosure as soon as \\npracticable after obtaining the information.  Both have an adverse effect on \\nexpression.  People may be reluctant to report given that doing so may subject \\nthem to prosecution if they do not disclose illegal conduct.  The requirement that \\n                                                 \\n \\n48  CCLA v Attorney General of Ontario, 2020 ONSC 4838 [\"CCLA\"] at para 42; citing Slaight Communications Inc \\nv Davidson, [1989] 1 SCR 1038 at para 95.  \\n49 McAteer v.

In my view, that \\neffect on expression is worthy of constitutional disapprobation.  The expression \\nbeing affected is expression that goes to the heart of the reason we protect \\nfreedom of expression which the Supreme Court of Canada described as follows \\nin R.  v. Keegstra: \\nAt the core of freedom of expression lies the need to ensure \\nthat truth and the common good are attained, whether in \\nscientific and artistic endeavors or in the process of \\ndetermining the best course to take in our political affairs.  \\nSince truth and the ideal form of political and social \\norganization can rarely, if at all, be identified with absolute \\ncertainty, it is difficult to prohibit expression without impeding \\nthe free exchange of potentially valuable information.51   \\n \\n \\n[118] Although many will disagree with the applicants’ views, their expression is aimed \\nat truth seeking and aimed at promoting social and political dialogue about a matter \\nof public policy.  In my view, s. 12(1)(d) of the Regulation does amount to \\ncompelled speech of the sort that infringes s.  2(b) of the Charter. \\n[119] The third limitation arises out of s. 12(2)(a)(i) and (ii)  of the Regulation which \\nremoves the whistleblower exemption if the person “directly or indirectly”: \\n(i) \\ncaused or contributed to the disclosed harm to a farm \\nanimal, … or illegal activity, or \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n \\n51 R v Keegstra, [1990] 3 SCR 697 at p 762. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 47 \\n \\n \\n(ii) \\ncaused any harm to a farm animal … to obtain the \\ninformation that is disclosed to the police officer or the \\nauthority.   \\n \\n \\nSection 12(2)(a)(i) appears to cover harm or illegal activity unrelated to the \\ncommunication the whistleblower is making.  Section 12(2)(a)(ii) is limited to \\ncausing harm in order to obtain the information the whistleblower is disclosing to \\nthe governmental authority.   \\n[120] These provisions do not exclude from their ambit harm caused by generally \\naccepted practices of animal husbandry.  The applicants submit that, as a result, \\nan employee who docked tails, castrated piglets without anaesthesia or threw live \\nchicks into a grinder would potentially lose the whistleblower exemption because \\nthey had caused harm to an animal.   \\n[121] Ontario submits that this concern is unfounded because courts will first interpret \\nthe statute properly and then determine whether it involves a breach of Charter \\nrights.  In doing so, courts will presume that legislatures do not create meaningless \\nexemptions and that courts will read down legislative instruments that purport to \\ndo so.  It relies on Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc.52 and Canada \\n(Attorney General) v. JTI-Macdonald Corp. for this proposition.53  In JTI,  the court \\nwas confronted with a provision that it described as ambiguous and held at \\nparagraph 55:  \\n                                                 \\n \\n52 Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc., 2005 SCC 62 , [2005] 3 SCR 141 at paras. 18-35. \\n53 Canada (Attorney General) v. JTI-Macdonald Corp., 2007 SCC 30 , [2007] 2 SCR 610; \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 48 \\n \\n \\nConfronted with a statutory provision that, read literally, \\nseems to make no sense, the court should ask whether the \\nsection can be interpreted in a manner that fits the context \\nand achieves a rational result.54 \\n \\n \\n[122] Applying this principle, Ontario submits that a court would never conclude that \\nharming an animal using generally accepted practices of animal husbandry \\namounts to harm to an animal for purposes of the Regulation.  \\n[123] The words of the Regulation make sense in the context of provisions that were \\nimplemented to reduce or eliminate undercover exposés.  In that context, the broad \\nlanguage of the Regulation can be seen to have a chilling effect.  If the purpose is \\nto reduce undercover exposés,  a chilling effect would in fact be the intention.  That \\nchilling effect could easily be removed by carving out from ss 12(2)(a)(i) and (ii) \\nharm that results from generally accepted practices of animal husbandry.   \\n[124] This third limitation also removes the whistleblower exemption if the person \\nengaged in illegal activity.  On the face of the Regulation this includes illegal \\nconduct that the employee was directed to engage in by their employer.  As with \\nearlier provisions, this requires a whistleblower to make an instant and correct \\ndistinction between generally accepted practices of animal husbandry and illegal \\nactivity in circumstances that are, as noted, fraught with ambiguity.  The regulation \\ncould also have been drafted to exclude harm that results from a task that the \\nemployee was required to perform as part of their employment duties.   \\n                                                 \\n \\n54 Canada (Attorney General) v. JTI-Macdonald Corp., 2007 SCC 30 , [2007] 2 SCR 610 at para. 55. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 49 \\n \\n \\n[125] Finally on this third limitation, it is no answer to an allegation of a Charter breach \\nto say that courts will read down the statute when charges are laid as a result of \\nwhich the court should not trouble itself with the issue on an application for a \\ndeclaration such as this.  \\n[126] I am mindful that the concept of minimal impairment does not require the \\ngovernment to show that the method it has chosen is the least drastic means of \\nachieving its objective.  Courts must accord some deference to the legislature by \\ngiving it a certain latitude.  If the law falls within a range of reasonable alternatives, \\ncourts will not find it overbroad simply because they can think of an alternative \\nwhich might impair rights less.55   \\n[127] In circumstances where one of the concerns is the chilling effect of the Regulation \\non expression and where the respondent’s chief witness agrees that the impetus \\nbehind s. 5(6) of the Act was eliminate undercover exposés, the failure of the \\nRegulation to protect conduct carried out in accordance with generally accepted \\npractices of animal husbandry or conduct that an employee was directed to engage \\nin as part of their employment duties removes s. 9 of the Regulation from a range \\nof reasonable alternatives.   \\n[128] The fourth limitation arises out of s.  12(2)(c) of the Regulation which removes the \\nwhistleblower exemption if: \\n                                                 \\n \\n55 Mounted Police Association of Ontario v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 1, at para.149 \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 50 \\n \\n \\nbefore the person completed gathering information, the \\nowner or occupier of the farm, animal processing facility or \\nthe prescribed premises or the driver of the motor vehicle, as \\nthe case may be, asks the person to leave the farm, facility \\nor premises or the area where the motor vehicle is located, \\nor to stop interfering or interacting with farm animals. \\n \\n \\n[129] In other words, if the whistleblower is caught before completing his or her \\ninformation gathering, they lose the whistleblower exemption.  This risks creating \\nan offence retroactively.  That is to say, when the whistleblower begins gathering \\ninformation, there is no offence but if the whistleblower is caught in the act of \\ngathering information, their past conduct becomes an offence because, if they are \\ncaught while gathering information, they have, by definition, not “completed \\ngathering information.”  In those circumstances, no one would ever know, while \\ngathering information, if they were committing an offence because the penal nature \\nof the activity would turn on whether the person is caught in the act, something \\nthat could never be determined in advance.   \\n[130] Ontario submits that s. 12(2)(c) of the Regulation means simply that the person \\nhas no right to remain on the premises under the whistleblower exemption if they \\nhave been asked to leave.  I do not accept that submission.  That is simply not \\nwhat the provision says.  It does not refer to the whistleblower having to leave the \\npremises if asked to do so.  It removes the whistleblower exemption which in turn \\nwould remove the consent that the whistleblower had to be on the property which \\nturns them into a trespasser and renders them liable to punishment under the Act.  \\nThe respondent’s interpretation is entirely unnecessary because any individual is \\nrequired to leave premises at the request of an owner or occupier.  The Trespass \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 51 \\n \\n \\nto Property Act56  already makes that clear.  If the objection to that analysis is that \\nfines in the Trespass to Property Act are too low, one could simply have taken the \\nlanguage from the Trespass to Property Act that requires someone to leave \\npremises immediately when asked and put it in into s. 12(2)(c) of the Regulation. \\n[131] As a result of the foregoing, I conclude that ss 12(1)(c) and (d); 12(2)(a)(i) and (ii); \\nand 12(2)(c) of the regulation are not minimally impairing or reasonably tailored to \\nthe Act’s avowed objectives but instead, further the restriction on freedom of \\nexpression. \\n \\nc. Journalism Exemption \\n \\n[132] Ontario submits that the Act and its Regulation are minimally impairing because s.  \\n11 of the Regulation contains an exemption for journalists.  It is similar to the \\nwhistleblower exemption.  It provides that, despite ss 9 and 10 of the Regulation, \\na person who gave a false statement shall not be considered to have obtained \\nconsent under false pretences if the person is a journalist.   \\n[133] Like the whistleblower exemption the journalism exemption only applies if the \\njournalist does not cause or contribute to harm to a farm animal (s. 11(1)(d) of the \\n                                                 \\n \\n56 Trespass to Property Act, RSO 1990, c T.21, s. 2(1)(b) \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 52 \\n \\n \\nRegulation) and the owner does not ask the journalist to leave before the journalist \\nhas completed gathering information (s. 11(1)(e) of the Regulation).   \\n[134] A journalist in this context is most likely to be acting as an undercover employee, \\nas a result of which  the same analysis applies to these provisions here as applied \\nin the context of whistleblowers.  If the journalist was following the direction of the \\nowner or occupier of the agricultural premises, the requirement in s. 11(1)(d) \\nshould not apply.     \\n[135] The provision that makes the journalists exception applicable only if the owner or \\noccupier does not ask the journalist to leave the premises before the journalist has \\ncompleted gathering information in s. 11(1)(e) of the Regulation fails to make the \\nRegulation minimally impairing and furthers the restriction on freedom of \\nexpression for the same reasons as set out in the discussion of the parallel \\nprovision in the whistleblower exemption. \\n[136] In addition, the journalism exemption is further limited by s. 11(2) of the Regulation \\nwhich defines a “journalist” to mean a person who: \\n(a) is employed or hired by, or works in connection with, the news media, \\na press association, news agency, wire service or post-secondary \\njournalism course or program, and  \\n \\n(b) contributes directly to the collection, writing or production of \\ninformation for dissemination by the news media or other entity \\nreferred to in clause (a) to the public in the public interest;  \\n \\n “news media” means corporations or entities whose primary function is to \\ndisseminate information to the general public on a regular basis, whether \\nin writing or by radio, television or similar electronic means. \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 53 \\n \\n \\n[137] The applicants argue that the journalists’ exemption is of no practical use because \\nit is limited to traditional news media which would rarely, if ever, conduct \\ninvestigations that require them to obtain employment under false pretences.   \\n[138] The respondent argues that the narrower definition is required in s.  11(2) of the \\nRegulation because true journalists follow proper journalistic methods when \\ngathering information and verify such information to ensure that it is accurate.  True \\njournalists also give the other side a chance to respond; undercover operatives do \\nnot. \\n[139] Both sides filed experts reports.  The applicants from Robert Cribb; the respondent \\nfrom Ivor Shapiro.  Both are highly qualified experts.  Their reports are thoughtful \\nand impartial.  Both reports point to the difficulty of defining journalism at today’s \\njuncture because society’s conception of journalism is   in flux.  Traditionally, a \\njournalist was readily identifiable as someone working for an accredited media \\norganization or perhaps someone who was a full-time freelance journalist who \\ncontributed to accredited news organizations.  The advent of social media has \\ndisrupted that traditional understanding.  Journalism has historically acted as a \\ngatekeeper of information.  It served a curatorial function which allowed the public \\nto have a degree of confidence in what was published in reputable media.  That \\ndegree of confidence may be less justified in uncurated media.   \\n[140] The applicants ask me to strike s. 11 of the Regulation as unconstitutional, \\nbecause its more limited definition of journalism does not take into account the \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 54 \\n \\n \\nmany reputable journalists now working through social media as a result of \\nmassive layoffs from traditional media over the last few years. \\n[141] A definition of journalism has always been difficult.  It is even more difficult today \\nfor the reasons outlined above.   To some degree, the definition may depend on \\nits purpose.  A tax definition of journalist may differ from one used for confidentiality \\nof sources or freedom of expression.  That said, I note that the Supreme Court of \\nCanada recognized the importance of newer, non-traditional media in facilitating \\nbroader discussions of matters of public interest in Grant v. Torstar Corp.57   In that \\ncase the court modified the law of defamation to recognize the defence of \\nresponsible communication on matters of public interest.  In doing so the court \\nnoted:  \\n… However, the traditional media are rapidly being \\ncomplemented by new ways of communicating on matters of \\npublic interest, many of them online, which do not involve \\njournalists.  These new disseminators of news and \\ninformation should, absent good reasons for exclusion, be \\nsubject to the same laws as established media outlets.  I \\nagree with Lord Hoffmann that the new defence is “available \\nto anyone who publishes material of public interest in any \\nmedium.58 (Citations omitted). \\n \\n \\n[142] The only concerns Ontario advanced to support its limitation of journalism to \\ntraditional media and limited types of freelancers is that they follow certain methods \\nand verify information.  Those concerns, however, also applied to the \\n                                                 \\n \\n57 Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 SCR 640 \\n58 Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 SCR 640 at para. 96. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 55 \\n \\n \\ndisseminators of information that the Supreme Court held should be subject to the \\nsame laws as media outlets.  Moreover, Ontario did not take me to any exposés \\nof undercover activists that it alleged were inaccurate.  I was, however, taken to \\nexamples of exposé videos created by undercover activists that were then \\npublished by established media such as CTV and CBC.   \\n[143] Given the limited amount of space and time devoted to this issue in the factums \\nand oral argument, this is not the case in which to embark on a judicial definition \\nof “journalism.”     While I do not use Grant as a basis for striking the definition of \\njournalism in s. 11 (2) of the Regulation as unconstitutional, I do find that the more \\nlimited definition of journalism is s. 11 is one that prevents the provision from being \\nminimally impairing for purposes of the s. 1 analysis.   \\n \\n \\niv. \\nProportionality \\n[144] The final stage of the s. 1 analysis requires the court to balance the salutary and \\ndeleterious effects of the government conduct.  This balancing exercise “allows for \\na broader assessment of whether the benefits of the impugned law are worth the \\ncost of the rights limitation.”59  The Supreme Court of Canada has described the \\nproportionality test as follows: \\nThe final question is whether there is proportionality between \\nthe effects of the measure that limits the right and the \\nlaw’s objective. This inquiry focuses on the practical impact \\nof the law.  What benefits will the measure yield in terms of \\n                                                 \\n \\n59 Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009] 2 SCR 567 at para. 77. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 56 \\n \\n \\nthe collective good sought to be achieved?  How important is \\nthe limitation on the right?  When one is weighed against the \\nother, is the limitation justified? 60 \\n \\n[145] The salutary effect of the legislation is said to be to deter unlawful trespass, protect \\nbiosecurity, and avoid harm to animals, farmers and the economy.  I agree that \\nthose are all valuable, legitimate, salutary effects of the legislation. \\n[146] In my view, however, the deleterious effect of some provisions of the Act and \\nRegulation are disproportionately large when one balances them against the \\nlimitations on freedom of expression.   \\n[147] I turn first to the effects that are proportionate.  \\n[148] The restrictions that the Act imposes on more traditional trespass in the sense of \\nbeing on a property without any colour of right or in the sense of breaking and \\nentering onto properties are proportionate.  Individuals simply do not have the right \\nto break into or enter onto property without any colour of right in the purported \\nexercise of freedom of expression.  In this light, the prohibitions in the Act are no \\ndifferent than breaking into a residential property or checking for unlocked doors \\nand entering an unlocked residential property without any invitation from its owner \\nor occupant. \\n[149] Similarly, s. 10 of the Regulation which characterizes someone who has overstated \\ntheir qualifications as a trespasser is also proportionate.  The prohibition on \\n                                                 \\n \\n60 Canada (Attorney General) v. JTI-Macdonald Corp., 2007 SCC 30, [2007] 2 SCR 610 \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 57 \\n \\n \\noverstatement is directly related to the Act’s objectives relating to biosecurity and \\nsafety of animals.  For someone to claim qualifications in for example, biosecurity \\nor veterinary care, when they have no such credentials can imperil biosecurity and \\nanimal safety.  The limits on freedom of expression that s.  10 imposes are \\nproportionate in that they are tightly aligned with the Act’s objectives in this regard.  \\nIn addition, the importance of biosecurity and animal health outweigh the freedom \\nto overstate one’s qualifications.  In this light, s. 10 of the Regulation is more in line \\nwith traditionally accepted limitations on freedom of speech involving fraud or \\nmisrepresentation.  \\n[150] Section 9 of the Regulation is more troublesome.  It targets false statements more \\ngenerally.  The practical effect of that restriction is to target people who understate \\ntheir qualifications or deny affiliations with animal rights groups to get jobs in places \\nwhere animals are raised or slaughtered.  The language of the Act and Regulation, \\nhowever, go even further and turn into trespassers people who have gained \\naccess to otherwise public or quasi public places like animal auctions, petting zoos, \\nfairs and circuses by, for example, denying affiliation with any animal rights groups.  \\n[151] I consider the proportionality of this restriction against the following factors: the \\nvalue of the expression at issue, biosecurity and animal safety, farmer safety, the \\neconomy and the applicants’ long-term goals. \\nValue of the Expression \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 58 \\n \\n \\n[152] The freedom and the value of the expression at issue here can be assessed at two \\nlevels.  The first level penalizes the misrepresentation made to gain entry to the \\nagricultural premises no matter how unrelated to the purposes of the Act.  The \\nsecond level, in effect, penalizes a person for communicating what they see  on \\nthe premises after having gained entry. \\n[153] Turning to the first level of expression.  As noted, the most immediate concern for \\nthe applicants is the undercover activist who obtains a job by denying that they \\nhave a university degree or by denying any association with an animal rights group.  \\nOntario also asks me to take into account the low social and constitutional value \\nof lying in the proportionality analysis.   \\n[154] The Supreme Court of Canada has held that misrepresentations and lies are \\nconstitutionally protected speech.    In R. v. Zundel,61 a notorious Holocaust denier \\nwas convicted at trial under s. 181 of the Criminal Code which provided:  \\nEveryone who wilfully publishes a statement, tale or news \\nthat he knows is false and that causes or is likely to cause \\ninjury or mischief to a public interest is guilty of an indictable \\noffence …  \\n \\n \\n[155] The Supreme Court reversed the conviction and found that s.  181 of the Criminal \\nCode amounted to an infringement of freedom of expression under s.  2(b) of the \\nCharter which was not justified under s. 1.  In response to the Crown’s argument \\n                                                 \\n \\n61 R. v. Zundel, 1992 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1992] 2 SCR 731 \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 59 \\n \\n \\nthat the Zundel’s speech served none of the values underlying freedom of \\nexpression, the Supreme Court noted: \\n… A deliberate lie, it is said, does not promote truth, political \\nor social participation, or self-fulfilment.  Therefore, it is not \\ndeserving of protection.  \\n \\nApart from the fact that acceptance of this argument would \\nrequire this Court to depart from its view that the content of a \\nstatement should not determine whether it falls within s. 2(b), \\nthe submission presents two difficulties which are, in my \\nview, insurmountable. The first stems from the difficulty of \\nconcluding categorically that all deliberate lies are entirely \\nunrelated to the values underlying s. 2(b) of the Charter.  \\nThe second lies in the difficulty of determining the meaning \\nof a statement and whether it is false. \\n \\n  \\nThe first difficulty results from the premise that deliberate lies \\ncan never have value.  Exaggeration -- even clear \\nfalsification -- may arguably serve useful social purposes \\nlinked to the values underlying freedom of expression.  A \\nperson fighting cruelty against animals may knowingly cite \\nfalse statistics in pursuit of his or her beliefs and with the \\npurpose of communicating a more fundamental message, \\ne.g., `cruelty to animals is increasing and must be stopped\\'.  \\nA doctor, in order to persuade people to be inoculated \\nagainst a burgeoning epidemic, may exaggerate the number \\nor geographical location of persons potentially infected with \\nthe virus.  An artist, for artistic purposes, may make a \\nstatement that a particular society considers both an \\nassertion of fact and a manifestly deliberate lie; consider the \\ncase of Salman Rushdie\\'s Satanic Verses, viewed by many \\nMuslim societies as perpetrating deliberate lies against the \\nProphet.62 \\n \\n \\n[156] If lies can amount to protected speech in a context as odious as Holocaust denial, \\nthey should be equally protected when someone denies having a university degree \\n                                                 \\n \\n62 R. v. Zundel, 1992 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1992] 2 SCR 731at 754-755. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 60 \\n \\n \\nor being affiliated with an animal rights group to obtain employment at or entry to \\nan animal auction, petting zoo, rodeo, fair or circus. \\n[157] I turn now to the second level of analysis which I have described as,  in effect, \\npenalizing a person for communicating what they see  on the premises after having \\ngained entry. \\n[158] On its face, the Act does not purport to penalize the communication of what a \\nperson sees on the premises.  As a practical matter, however, no one is likely to \\nbe charged for making a false statement during a job interview if they then work \\non the premises as a diligent employee for the rest of their careers.  A charge and \\npenalty for the false statement is likely to arise only if the person communicates \\nwhat they see on the premises or if the person is caught while trying to \\ncommunicate what they see by, for example, recording a video.   \\n[159] This becomes even clearer from the whistleblower  exemption which relieves a \\nwhistleblower of liability if they disclose illegal activity but does not relieve them of \\nliability if they disclose legal activity.  In that instance it is the nature of the second \\ncommunication that determines liability. \\n[160] In my view the value of the first and second communications is high.  The \\nmisrepresentation to gain access is made in order to communicate what the person \\nsees on the premises.  The second form of expression communicates what the \\nperson sees.   \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 61 \\n \\n \\n[161] The expression is of public interest.  Publicizing the way in which animals are \\ntreated is an issue of interest to at least some members of the public.  It is an issue \\nabout which the public is entitled to be informed if they want to be.  It will then be \\nfor the public to determine whether they find the conditions acceptable when \\nbalanced against the consequences, if any, of changing those conditions. \\n[162] This is all the more so in light of the Supreme Court’s direction to consider the \\nvalue of the expression in the context of “the diversity in forms of individual self-\\nfulfillment and human flourishing [which] ought to be cultivated in an essentially \\ntolerant, indeed welcoming, environment not only for the sake of those who convey \\na meaning, but also for the sake of those to whom it is conveyed.”63 \\nBiosecurity and Animal Safety \\n[163] In justifying the Act and the Regulation, Ontario relies heavily on threats to \\nbiosecurity, contamination of the food supply chain and the safety of farm animals.  \\nAs noted earlier, Ontario points to the ease with which herds or flocks can be \\ninfected and the serious consequences such infections can have on animals and \\nthe economy.  Those are important concerns.   \\n[164] However, for a potential employee to deny any association with animal-rights \\ngroups in a job interview does not threaten biosecurity, the food supply chain or \\n                                                 \\n \\n63 Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 87 (SCC), [1989] 1 SCR 927 at p. 278. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 62 \\n \\n \\nanimal safety.  Nor does the follow-up act of such an activist communicating what \\nthey see in an agricultural facility.   \\n[165] Ontario’s affiant, Scott Duff suggests in para. 37 of his affidavit that the Act is also \\naimed at undercover operatives who obtain employment and fail to follow \\nbiosecurity protocols. Ontario asked in oral argument how do we know whether \\nundercover employees observe biosecurity protocols?  That, however, is not the \\nquestion.  The question should be whether there is any greater risk of undercover \\nemployees failing to follow biosecurity protocols than there is of ordinary \\nemployees failing to follow them. \\n[166] There was no evidence put to me which suggests that undercover employees \\ncreate any overall greater risk to biosecurity or animal safety than that caused by \\nany other employee.  Nor was there any evidence put to me of an undercover \\nemployee importing a biosecurity hazard into a facility.   \\n[167] The respondent’s fact witness, Eric Schwindt, a career hog producer and former \\nChair of the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board, agreed on cross-\\nexamination that an under cover employee poses no greater biosecurity risk than \\nany other employee.64   Both the undercover operative and the ordinary employee \\nreceive the same level of training on biosecurity hazards and procedures, both \\nreceive the same level of supervision and both receive the same level of discipline \\nfor failure to follow protocols.  If anything, an undercover employee has as much \\n                                                 \\n \\n64 Cross-examination of Eric Schwindt q.162,   \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 63 \\n \\n \\nor greater incentive to comply with protocols as a regular employee because the \\nunder cover employee wants to remain on site until they have the information they \\nwould like.  Harming animals by wilfully introducing diseases would also appear to \\ncontradict the overall goal of animal rights activists to improve animal welfare. \\n[168] The respondent’s swine health expert, Dr. Robert Friendship explained that the \\ngreatest risk to biosecurity comes from an infected animal being brought to a \\nfacility or being moved from one contained area in a facility to another area in the \\nsame facility.  Dr. Friendship also agreed that some of the abuses shown on \\nundercover videos such as bodies of dead animals lying exposed next to living \\nanimals, feeding mouldy food to animals or employees leaving a facility during a \\nbreak and re-entering without sanitizing themselves, all amount to biosecurity \\nhazards. \\n[169] Moreover, despite the concern for biosecurity, there are no mandatory biosecurity \\nstandards or requirements in Ontario.   While certain industry organizations have \\ndeveloped best practices for biosecurity, it is left to each facility to decide what \\nprotocols to apply and how to apply them.   \\n[170] The government’s affiant, Scott Duff, agreed on cross-examination that any \\nconcern about biosecurity would be at least as well addressed as it is under the \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 64 \\n \\n \\nAct if all individuals in Animal Protection Zones were required to follow biosecurity \\nprotocols.65 \\n[171] To highlight concerns about animal safety, Ontario took me to two affidavits in \\nwhich livestock producers complained about two animal rights activists that they \\nhad inadvertently hired.  One is alleged to have failed to report health issues about \\nminks under her care.  The other is alleged to have failed to milk goats thereby \\ncausing them discomfort.  There are no doubt people on both sides of the debate \\nwho occasionally neglect animals.  That is inevitable when dealing with a group of \\npeople of a certain size.  That should not, however, limit the freedom of expression \\nof the larger group.   There is also contrary evidence in the record which suggests \\nthat animal rights activists are more likely to be attentive to livestock health \\nbecause of their concern for animals.   \\n[172] Although the Act’s concerns about biosecurity and animal safety are valid, a \\nmisrepresentation that understates one’s qualifications or that denies association \\nwith an animal rights group  and the subsequent communication of what the person \\nsaw has no bearing on biosecurity or animal safety.   \\nFarmer Safety \\n[173] A further goal of the Act is the safety of farmers, their families and persons working \\nin or on farms, animal processing facilities and prescribed premises.   \\n                                                 \\n \\n65 Cross-examination of Scott Duff at q. 269. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 65 \\n \\n \\n[174] Ontario took me to evidence of farmers who had been intimidated and harassed \\nby activists.  The House of Commons report attached to Ms. Fitzgerald’s affidavit \\nspoke of cyber bullying.  There is, however, no evidence before me that individuals \\nwho, for example,  gain employment by deceptive means are the ones who harass \\nfarmers.  I accept, however, that the publication of videos showing the conditions \\nin which animals are kept can lead certain types of people to become overly \\naggressive and can lead them to harass those that they believe are mistreating \\nanimals.  To that extent, the communication by animal rights activists of what they \\nsaw on certain premises can have an adverse effect on the psychological health \\nof the victims of the harassment.  \\n[175] The House of Commons report attached to Ms. Fitzgerald’s affidavit sets out the \\ncommon stressors to farmers.66  They are: finances, volatile markets, long hours, \\nfamily disagreements, lack of sleep, unreasonable personal goals, weather, \\nadministrative burden, machinery breakdowns, injury, dangerous goods and \\nlivestock well-being.  Harassment is not identified as one of the key stressors.  That \\nsaid, the report does speak about the stigmatization of farming as follows:   \\nMs. Connery said that some of the stress farmers feel stems \\nfrom \"the difference between the public perception of what a \\nfarm is and the reality of what a farm is, including how we \\ntreat our animals, our land, our water supplies, and all of the \\nresources we use. \\n \\nThis lack of understanding of farmers\\' work can sometimes \\ncause distress, especially when individuals question the \\nintegrity of certain farmers. Some witnesses told the \\n                                                 \\n \\n66 See CaseLines p. B-1-4740 \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 66 \\n \\n \\nCommittee that activist groups use social media to put \\npressure on livestock producers. Ms. Desrosiers argued that \\n\"animal rights activists\" are \"a growing threat\" to livestock \\nproducers. \\n \\nMr. Campbell described to the Committee how he has been \\ncyberbullied: \"I\\'ve been told online that I\\'m a murderer. My \\nwife has been asked why she would ever be with someone \\nwho rapes animals.\" Mr. Skinner had a similar experience: \\n\"there is also a small minority of people who attack my \\nintegrity and question my morality because I raise animals \\nfor food.\"   He admitted that being targeted in this way has \\nhad a serious impact on his mental health. \\n \\n[176] The Committee’s recommendation in this respect was as follows: \\nRecommendation 3  \\n \\nGiven the prevalence of government initiatives, studies, and \\nprograms to combat cyber bullying and other forms of \\nintimidation and coercion targeted at students and \\nvulnerable Canadians, the Government should engage with \\nfarmers and agricultural stakeholder groups to develop \\npublic awareness campaigns and strategies to combat the \\ngrowing incidence of cyber bullying, intimidation, and threats \\ntargeted at Canada\\'s agricultural workers which results in a \\nsignificant increase in stress. In addition, the Committee \\nrecommends that the Government of Canada consider \\nincluding any form of intimidation or cyberbullying targeted at \\nany group of Canadians based on their occupation or place \\nof residence as a Criminal Code offence. \\n \\n[177] In other words, the Committee recognized that harassment was not unique to \\nagricultural workers but was a wider problem within society.  The Committee’s \\nrecommendation to develop public awareness campaigns is far more consistent \\nwith freedom of expression and proportionality than penalizing representations that \\ndo not, in and of themselves, harass farmers.  \\n[178] Freedom of expression is not without cost.  Some will be offended by the \\nexpression itself.  Others will take a communication which may not be harmful in \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 67 \\n \\n \\nand of itself and use it as a springboard for offensive conduct like harassment.  \\nRather than punishing the expression, the more proportionate response is counter \\nspeech that explains the practices at issue and why they are necessary.  It will \\nthen be up to social consensus to determine whether the practice should continue \\nor be modified.  An alternative proportionate measure would be sanctions that \\ntarget harassment.  Targeting those who engage in truthful communication \\nbecause those communications incite others into inappropriate conduct, strikes me \\nas disproportionate. \\nAvoiding Economic Harm \\n[179] Section 1(d) of the Act articulates one of its purposes as preventing “any adverse \\neffects the risks described in clause (a) may have on Ontario’s overall economy.”  \\nThe risks in clause (a) are those “that are created when individuals trespass on \\nfarm property or interfere with animals including the risk of exposing farm animals \\nto disease and stress as well as the risk of introducing contaminants into the food \\nsupply.”   \\n[180] If economic harm in this regard refers to harm caused by biosecurity threats or \\ncontamination of the food supply, the provisions of the Act that prohibit trespass in \\nthe traditional sense of someone being on a property without colour of right and \\nthat penalize those who purport to have qualifications that they do not actually have \\nare valid and proportionate. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 68 \\n \\n \\n[181] The simple fact that an undercover activist obtains a job by understating their \\nqualifications does not create economic harm.  If the intention, however, is to \\nprotect the economy from harm that may be done by people who record or describe \\nwhat they have seen in an animal protection zone, then the measure is \\ndisproportionate.  Indeed, penalizing truthful statements because they might harm \\nthe economy would seem to strike at the very heart of freedom of expression. \\nApplicants’ Long Term Goals \\n[182] Ontario submits that the application puts the court at the edge of a slippery slope \\nbecause the political goal of some of the interveners is not to improve animal \\nwelfare but to eliminate the use of animals in the service of humans for any \\npurpose.67  The fact that particular views may be outside of the mainstream does \\nnot mean that their expression should be constrained any more than views that \\nare within the mainstream.  It is, in fact, usually the opposite.  Those who find \\nthemselves in the mainstream of social consensus rarely need to invoke freedom \\nof expression because their speech gives rise to little, if any, opposition.  It is the \\nvery fact that certain views lie outside of the general social consensus that makes \\nfreedom of expression important to protect. \\n[183] In light of the foregoing I find that general prohibition on misstatements is not saved \\nby s. 1 of the Charter.   \\n                                                 \\n \\n67 See for example  q. 195 on the cross-examination of Cindy Beals from Last Chance for Animals. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 69 \\n \\n \\nD. Conclusion on False Pretences and Freedom of Expression \\n \\n[184] Bringing these various strands of analysis together, I find that ss 5(6) and 14(2) of \\nthe Act do not infringe on the applicants’ Charter rights.   Those sections are more \\nenabling provisions than they are operative provisions.  That is to say, neither of \\nthem does the actual infringing.   Section 5(6) merely says that consent to enter \\ncertain premises is vitiated in prescribed circumstances.  Section 14(2) makes it \\nan offence for a person to use false pretences in prescribed circumstances to do \\ncertain things on certain premises.  \\n[185] More critical are the prescribed circumstances themselves.  Those are found in the \\nRegulation. \\n[186] For the reasons set out above, I find that s. 9 of the Regulation infringes on freedom \\nof expression and is not saved by s. 1 of the Charter.   \\n[187] The applicants ask me to find that ss. 11 and 12 of the Regulation infringe on \\nfreedom of expression in their entirety.  I decline to do so.   While those provisions \\nmay not be perfect, they may, in some circumstances, protect freedom of \\nexpression.  The preferable course of action is to make findings about those \\nspecific provisions that infringe on freedom of expression and are not saved by s. \\n1 of the Charter.  As a result, for the reasons set out above I find that ss 11(1)(d) \\nand (e); ss 12(1)(c) and (d); 12(2)(a)(i) and (ii) and 12(2)(c) of the Regulation \\ninfringe on freedom of expression and are not saved by s. 1 of the Charter. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 70 \\n \\n \\n[188] Although s. 10 of the Regulation infringes on freedom of expression, it is saved by \\ns. 1 of the Charter. \\n[189] While I find that the definition of journalist in s. 11(2) of the Regulation is \\ncontroversial, this is not the appropriate case in which to embark on a judicial \\ndefinition of journalist or journalism given the more limited role that issue played in \\nthe application.  Moreover, given my striking of s. 9 of the Regulation and certain \\nprovisions of ss 11 and 12 of the Regulation, the definition of journalism becomes \\nmore of an academic issue for purposes of this application.  \\nIII. \\nFreedom of Expression and Interaction with Animals \\n \\nA.  The Statutory Provisions \\n[190] The second principal challenge the applicants mount to the Act concerns the \\nprovisions that limit the applicants’ ability to interact with animals. \\n[191] Section 5(4) prohibits anyone from interfering or interacting with a farm animal in \\nan animal protection zone without the prior consent of the owner or occupier of the \\npremises. Section 5(6) of the Act vitiates any consent to interact with such animals \\nif the consent was obtained under false pretences.  \\n[192] Section 6(2) provides:   \\nNo person shall interfere or interact with a farm animal being \\ntransported by a motor vehicle without the prior consent of \\nthe driver of the motor vehicle. \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 71 \\n \\n \\n[193] Section 6(4) of the Act provides that any consent to interacting with a farm animal \\nis invalid if it was obtained using false pretences in the prescribed circumstances.  \\nAs with s. 5 of the Act, the prescribed circumstances are found in ss. 9 and 10 of \\nthe Regulation. \\n[194] Although the applicants do not challenge it, s. 6(1) is relevant to the challenge to \\ns. 6(2).  Section 6(1) provides: \\nNo person shall stop, hinder, obstruct or otherwise interfere \\nwith a motor vehicle transporting farm animals. \\n \\n \\n[195] Section 14 makes it an offence to breach ss. 5(4), 6(1) or (2) and makes infractions \\nof those sub-sections punishable by fines of up to $15,000 for the first offence and \\nup to $25,000 for subsequent offences.   \\n \\nB.   Do Limits on Interacting with Animals Restrain Freedom of \\nExpression? \\n \\n[196] The applicants submit that the limits on interacting with animals contained in  ss \\n5(4), 5(6), 6(2) and (4) of the Act infringe on their freedom of expression under s. \\n2(b) of the Charter because interacting with animals is integral to their self-\\nfulfillment.   \\n[197] In addition, the applicants submit that the limitations that ss 6(2) and (4) of the Act \\nimpose  on their ability to interact with animals being transported infringe on their \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 72 \\n \\n \\nright to freedom of assembly under s. 2(c) of the Charter.  The applicants say this \\ninfringes on what they refer to as “bearing witness.”  Bearing witness involves   the \\nholding of a vigil or protest outside of a slaughterhouse and observing trucks \\ntransporting livestock as they enter the facility.  As part of that exercise, protesters \\nsometimes stop trucks and interact with animals by putting their faces close to \\nvents in the truck, or giving animals water through the vents.  As described in the \\napplicants’ factum, the object of such interactions is to “show kindness and \\ncompassion to [animals] in their final moments, including by petting animals who \\nseek affection.”68 The applicants submit that this interaction is an integral part of \\ntheir self-fulfillment.   \\n[198] I agree that the conduct that ss 5(4) and 6(2) prohibit is a form of expression.   \\n[199] The purpose of ss 5(4) and 6(2) is not to restrain speech but to protect animal \\nsafety and biosecurity.  In addition, s. 6(2) seeks to protect the safety of protesters.  \\nThe Regan Russell Foundation submits that protester safety is not an avowed \\npurpose of the Act but that only biosecurity and animal safety are.  I do not agree \\nwith that characterization. Section 1(a) of the Act defines one of its purposes as \\nbeing to “eliminate or reduce the unique risks that are created when individuals… \\ninterfere with farm animals…” One of those risks is physical danger to protesters. \\n                                                 \\n \\n68 Applicants\\' factum para. 93. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 73 \\n \\n \\n[200] Although the purpose of ss 5(4) and 6(2) is not to limit freedom of expression, their \\neffect is to do so insofar as they limit the ability of people to interact with livestock \\nin trucks or more generally.  \\n[201] Interacting with livestock is not, however, in my view, expressive content that is \\nprotected by the Charter.  As noted in the analysis dealing with s. 5(6), one of the \\nquestions the court must ask itself in considering whether government conduct \\ninfringes on freedom of expression is whether the location of the expression \\nremoves it from the protection of s. 2(b).   \\n \\n[202] I am satisfied that the location and mode of the expression that ss 5(4) and 6(2) of \\nthe Act address, removes the expression from s. 2(b) of the Charter.  The \\nprotection the applicants seek is to interact with animals.  In other words, the \\napplicants want to use physical contact with the private property of another person \\nas a means to their self-fulfillment.  I was not directed to any authority that extends \\nCharter protection to that degree nor would it, in my view, be appropriate to do so.  \\nThe purpose of protecting freedom of expression is to do just that, allow people to \\nexpress themselves.  It does not allow people to appropriate, even momentarily, \\nthe property of others as a means for that expression.   \\n[203] The Regan Russell Foundation analogizes the limitation under s. 6(2) to being free \\nto attend a demonstration but being prohibited from having incidental contact with \\nanother demonstrator or being free to walk down the street with a child but being \\npenalized if the child touches someone’s lawn.  I do not find those to be helpful \\nanalogies.  In those analogies, the contact with another’s private property or \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 74 \\n \\n \\nperson is an insignificant, incidental, and accidental consequence of the \\nexpression.  The physical contact the applicants want with someone else’s \\nproperty is the expression.   \\n[204] The Act does not infringe on freedom of assembly.  It does not prohibit protesting \\nin the immediate vicinity of slaughterhouses or trucks that transport animals.  \\nProtesters are free to continue to hold vigils outside of slaughterhouses, display \\nsigns, hand out pamphlets and photograph the interior of the transport trucks to \\ndocument the conditions in which animals are being transported.   \\nC. \\nAre ss 5(4) and  6(2)  of the Act Saved by s. 1 of the Charter?   \\n[205] Although I have found that ss 5(4) and  6(2) do not infringe on Charter protected \\nrights, I will nevertheless proceed to consider whether those subsections would be \\nsaved by s. 1 of the Charter in the event I am wrong in my analysis of the Charter \\ninfringement.  \\n[206] As noted earlier, to justify an infringement of a Charter right under s. 1, the \\ngovernment must demonstrate that the measure: (i) furthers a pressing and \\nsubstantial objective; (ii) is rationally connected to the objective; (iii) minimally \\nimpairs the right at issue; and (iv) is proportionate in that its benefits outweigh its \\ndeleterious effects.69  I am satisfied that s. 6 meets all four of these requirements.   \\nPressing and Substantial Objective \\n                                                 \\n \\n69 R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 75 \\n \\n \\n[207] As noted, the purpose of ss  5(4) and 6(2) as articulated in s. 1(h) of the Act is to \\n“eliminate or reduce the unique risks that are created when individuals…  interfere \\nwith farm animals…”  \\n[208] Two such risks are biosecurity and animal safety.  I have already identified those \\nas pressing and substantial objectives.     \\n[209] A further risk is the safety of protesters if they interact with animals in large \\ntransport trucks.  The Court of Appeal has held that regulating the interaction of \\npedestrians and vehicles on roadways is a pressing and substantial government \\nobjective.70 \\nRational Connection \\n[210] There is a rational connection between biosecurity, animal safety and protester \\nsafety on the one hand and the restriction on interacting with animals. \\n[211] Protesters who bear witness often give water to animals.  Although giving water to \\nanimals is not, in and of itself a threat to biosecurity, giving other sorts of \\nsubstances to animals may well create a threat to biosecurity and animal safety.  \\nEnsuring that noxious substances are not given to animals in transport is one way \\nof meeting the objective of both biosecurity and animal safety. \\n                                                 \\n \\n70 R. v. Banks, 2007 ONCA 19 at para. 129. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 76 \\n \\n \\n[212] In addition, protesters will sometimes spray water into the truck in the belief that \\nthey are helping cool down animals on hot days.  That water makes its way to the \\nfloor of the truck.  When it mixes with excrement on the floor, it creates slippery \\nconditions that can lead to animals falling.  The cramped conditions on the trucks \\nthen make it difficult for a fallen animal to get back up on its feet and creates the \\nrisk of the fallen animal being walked or stomped on by other animals.   \\n[213] In R. v. Banks,71 the Court of Appeal for Ontario accepted that there was a rational \\nconnection between regulating pedestrians approaching vehicles on a roadway \\nand traffic safety.  Quite apart from any finding in Banks, I am satisfied that the \\nlimitations in s. 6 have a rational connection to the safety of protesters.  \\n[214] The videos in the record show the dangers that protester interaction with animals \\ncan create.  They show protesters putting their hands through ventilation holes in \\ntrucks.  If a truck began moving while someone’s hand was in the ventilation gap, \\nit could cause serious injury.  Those dangers would be exacerbated in slippery \\nconditions caused by rain, ice or snow.   \\n[215] Danger to protester safety is further exacerbated by the characteristics of the \\ntrucks.  They are large and have substantial blind spots.  The evidence before me \\nindicated that in the middle of a right turn, a driver can see only approximately 25% \\nof the right side of the trailer.   Similarly, the trucks offer only limited visibility to \\nwhat is immediately in front of them because of the large size and height of the \\n                                                 \\n \\n71 R. v. Banks, 2007 ONCA 19 at para. 130. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 77 \\n \\n \\nfront hood.  Protesters tend not to be familiar with the limitations of trucks this large \\nor how their performance differs from automobiles.  These various factors create \\nconsiderable risks for protesters who interact with animals on the trucks.   \\n[216] If the operator of the truck consents to the interaction between protesters and \\nanimals, these dangers to protester safety are unlikely to arise because, in those \\ncircumstances, the truck is unlikely to move during the interaction. \\n[217] In the foregoing circumstances, I am satisfied that prohibiting protester interaction \\nwith animals in trucks without the operator’s consent is rationally connected to \\nprotester safety. \\n \\nMinimal Impairment \\n[218] I am equally satisfied that ss 5(4) and  6(2) of the Act minimally impair freedom of \\nexpression and freedom of assembly.   \\n[219] Both subsections minimally impair freedom of expression.  They simply control \\naccess of one person to another person’s private property. \\n[220] With respect to freedom of assembly, the evidence demonstrates that protests at \\nslaughterhouses have continued since the Act came into force.  \\n[221] The legislation does not prohibit protesting in the immediate vicinity of \\nslaughterhouses or trucks that transport animals. The legislation does not require \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 78 \\n \\n \\nprotesters to keep a certain distance from trucks.  The provision at issue simply \\nprohibits interaction with animals on the trucks.   \\n \\nProportionality \\n[222] In my view ss 5(4) and 6(2) impose limitations that are proportional to the \\nobjectives of biosecurity, animal safety and protester safety.  I am equally satisfied \\nthat their benefits outweigh their deleterious effects.   \\n[223] The limitations of both subsections are directly connected to animal safety and \\nbiosecurity.  Their deleterious effect is merely to restrain behaviour that the person \\nwho seeks to interact with animals has no right to in the first place.  Upholding the \\nconstitutionality of ss 5(4) and 6(2) would not have any adverse effect on the \\nfreedom of expression that I have found to be protected by the Charter when \\ndiscussing s.  5(6) of the Act and s. 9 of the Regulation.  A person who receives \\nan owner’s consent to interact with animals by virtue of a false statement that does \\nnot overstate the person’s qualifications would not run afoul of s. 5(4) or 6(2) based \\non my earlier analysis.  That person would have the owner’s (or driver’s) consent \\nto interact.  That consent is not vitiated by virtue of a statement that understated \\nthe person’s qualifications. \\n[224] With respect to the limit on interacting with animals in transport trucks in s. 6(2), \\nthe Regan Russell Foundation submits that a level of risk to public or personal \\nsafety is tolerable to ensure that democratic freedoms are maintained.  It argues \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 79 \\n \\n \\nthat some risk is tolerable and that s. 1 cannot be invoked to justify limits on \\nfreedom of expression simply because the expression involves risk.  I accept that \\nproposition insofar as it goes.  However, the risk and the limitation on freedom \\nmust be balanced against each other.  Ontario is not seeking to limit freedom of \\nexpression broadly in the face of minimal risk.  The opposite is the case.  Section \\n6(2) imposes minimal limitations on expression to prevent serious harm that has a \\nhigh risk of occurring. \\n[225] The Foundation notes that in the context of police powers, courts have identified \\n“a real risk of imminent harm,” as the point at which proactive measures to maintain \\nthe peace justify interference with liberty.72 I do not agree that this is the relevant \\ntest here.   That is the test for the exercise of police powers.   Those are \\ndiscretionary powers exercised on the spur of the moment without an express \\nstatutory foundation.  Legislation is a more deliberative act developed through \\ngreater consensus building than is a police officer’s decision to take action.  \\n[226] Even, however if the proper test were “a real risk of imminent harm,” I am satisfied \\nthat protesters do face a real risk of imminent harm if they interact with livestock \\non transport trucks given the visibility limitations associated with those trucks.  One \\nprotester, Regan Russell, has already died as a result of those risks.  That strikes \\nme as sufficient evidence of a real risk of imminent harm to others.   \\n                                                 \\n \\n72 Brown v Regional Municipality of Durham Police Service Board, [1998] OJ No 5274 (ON CA) at PDF p. 36; see \\nalso, Figueiras v Toronto(Police Services Board), 2015 ONCA 208. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 80 \\n \\n \\n[227] If the question is one of line drawing as the Regan Russell foundation submits, I \\nam satisfied that prohibiting protesters from interacting with animals on large \\ntransport trucks whose drivers have limited visibility, minimally impairs freedom of \\nexpression (assuming that such contact is constitutionally protected in the first \\nplace). As noted, protesters continue to be able to protest at slaughterhouse sites \\nand continue to be able to photograph the interiors of trucks.  They simply cannot \\ninteract with animals on the trucks.   \\n[228] In   R. v. Banks,73 the Ontario Court of Appeal found that directionally similar \\nprovisions which prohibited squeegeeing and solicitation of people in vehicles on \\nroadways were justified under s. 1 of the Charter.  There, the court held that \\nregulating the interaction of pedestrians and vehicles on roadways was sufficiently \\nimportant to warrant infringing on freedom of expression. \\n[229]  The applicants try to distinguish Banks by arguing that the value of the expression \\nin that case, squeegeeing or asking for change, was lower than the value of their \\nexpression.  To me the issue here turns not so much on the value of the expression \\nas on the value of lives.  The applicants’ lives are no less valuable than those of \\nsqueegeers.  The state has the same responsibility to legislate to protect them.  \\n \\n                                                 \\n \\n73 R. v. Banks, 2007 ONCA 19  \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 81 \\n \\n \\n[230] In the foregoing circumstances I am more than satisfied that the benefits of s. 6(2) \\nof the Act outweigh its deleterious effects and that it would amount to a proportional \\nlimitation on s. 2(b) rights if those rights were triggered here. \\n \\n[231] I turn then to s. 6(4) which vitiates consent to interact with an animal if the consent \\nwas obtained under false pretences in the prescribed circumstances.  The \\napplicants submit that this provision breaches their Charter rights.  Here, as with \\ns. 5(6), the prescribed circumstances that vitiate consent are found in ss 9 and 10 \\nof the Regulation.   As with s. 5(6), the Charter issue here is not so much that a \\nlegislative provision vitiates consent as it is about the circumstances that vitiate \\nconsent.  As with s. 5(6)  of the Act, I uphold s. 6(4) and focus instead on the \\nprescribed circumstances that vitiate consent. The reasons for striking s. 9 and \\nupholding s. 10 of the Regulation apply here with respect to s. 6(4) in the same \\nway as they do with respect to s. 5(6). \\n \\n[232] As a result of the foregoing, I decline the relief the applicants seek with respect to \\nss 5(4),  6(2) and 6(4) of the Act.  \\n  \\nE. Section 8 of the Regulation \\n[233] In a similar vein, the applicants seek a declaration that s.  8 of the Regulation \\nviolates their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly under ss \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 82 \\n \\n \\n2(b) and (c) of the Charter which cannot be saved under s.  1 and are therefore of \\nno force and effect. \\n[234] Section 8 of the Regulation defines interference with and interaction with farm \\nanimals.  I decline to award the applicants the relief they seek for the same reasons \\nthat I have declined to grant the relief they seek with respect to s.  6 of the Act.  \\nSection 8 of the Regulation deals with one person’s ability to interact with another \\nperson’s property.  As noted earlier in these reasons, that is not a right that is \\nsubject to Charter protection. \\nIV. Section 7 and the Power of Arrest \\n \\n[235] Section 8(1)(d) of the Act gives the owner or occupier of the facility the power to \\narrest someone who is on premises in contravention of ss 5(1) - (4) and (7).74  The \\napplicants argue that this violates their right to life, liberty and security of the person \\nand the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of \\nfundamental justice under s.  7 of the Charter and their right not to be arbitrarily \\ndetained or imprisoned under s.  9 of the Charter.  \\n[236] Ontario submits that the power of arrest does not apply to false pretences because \\nthe power to arrest applies only to breaches of enumerated sections of the Act \\nwhich sections do not include the false pretences provision in s. 5(6) of the Act.  I \\ndo not agree with that interpretation.  The arrest power applies where someone is \\n                                                 \\n \\n74 Section 5(7) deals with defacing or removing signs delineating an animal protection zone. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 83 \\n \\n \\non premises without the prior consent of the owner.  The false pretences provision \\nvitiates consent.  As a result, someone who is on premises by virtue of false \\npretences is by definition there without consent. \\n[237] The applicants submit that the private power of arrest breaches their Charter rights \\nbecause the power can be exercised based on only the subjective belief of the \\nowner that there are reasonable and probable grounds for arrest.  The applicants \\nbase this argument on s. 15 of the Regulation which provides that an owner or \\noccupier can exercise powers of arrest only “if the owner or occupier believes there \\nare reasonable and probable grounds for carrying out the arrest…” \\n[238]  The Ontario Court of Appeal has,  however, rejected the applicants’ argument \\nwhen dealing with similar arrest powers contained in the Trespass to Property \\nAct.75  In addition, the Supreme Court has held that where legislation speaks of a \\nbelief about having “reasonable and probable grounds,” that state of belief \\nimplicitly includes both subjective and objective components.76  In other words, a \\nbelief in reasonable and probable grounds requires not only that the person making \\nthe arrest believe that there are such grounds but also that a reasonable person in \\nthe shoes of the person making the arrest would believe that reasonable and \\nprobable grounds exist.77  That constitutes a complete answer to the applicants’ \\nobjections. \\n                                                 \\n \\n75 R. v. Asante-Mensah, 2001 CanLII 7279 (ON CA) at paras. 32-33. \\n76 Assante-Mensah, at para.33; Storrey v The Queen, 1990 CanLII 125 (SCC), p250-51 \\n77 Storrey v The Queen, 1990 CanLII 125 (SCC), p250-51 \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 84 \\n \\n \\n[239] Moreover, given my findings with respect to s.  9 of the Regulation, the arrest power \\nwould now be applicable only with respect to true trespassers who are on property \\nwithout colour of right or to people who have obtained access to property by \\noverstating their qualifications. \\n[240] The applicants also challenged the constitutionality of s. 8(4) of the Act which \\nstates that no person shall provide false or misleading information in response to \\na request for the person’s name and address made under s. 8(1)(a).  Section \\n8(1)(a) provides that an owner or occupier of premises who finds a person in an \\nanimal protection zone in contravention of subsection 5(1) - (4) or (7) may request \\nthat the person provide his or her name and address.   \\n[241] The applicants submit that this provision violates their freedom of expression under \\ns. 2(b) of the Charter.  Neither the applicants nor the respondent spent much time \\non this submission.  I therefore feel myself slightly disadvantaged by having to \\nanalyse the provision in somewhat of a vacuum.  Although the provision infringes \\non freedom of speech, I find the infringement to be saved by s. 1 of the Charter. \\n[242] In light of my earlier findings which have the effect of striking out s.  9 of the \\nRegulation,  the person in the animal protection zone in contravention of \\nsubsections 5(1) – (4) and (7) of the Act are true trespassers or those who have \\ngained access by exaggerating their qualifications.  Those are persons who do \\npose a potential risk to animal safety and biosecurity.   \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 85 \\n \\n \\n[243] The prohibition on false information here is rationally connected to the Act’s \\npurpose of protecting animal safety and biosecurity.  The owner and the state have \\na right to identify a person who may have caused a risk to animal safety and \\nbiosecurity.  Receiving false information in this regard could lead an investigation \\ndown a false road in circumstances where speed can be important.   \\n[244] The impairment is minimal.  It simply prohibits false information; it does not compel \\na response.  The person has the complete right to remain silent.  Although that \\nmay subject them to arrest, that is the risk one runs by trespassing on and \\ninteracting with another’s property without colour of right. \\n[245] The impairment is proportional.  The benefit of the provision is that it avoids \\ninvestigators having to follow false leads in an investigation that may be urgent.  \\nThe deleterious effect is that it deprives the person being asked from leading \\ninvestigations down a false path.  I note that there are directionally analogous \\nprovisions in other areas of the law such as s. 403 of the Criminal Code78 which \\nmakes it an offence to fraudulently impersonate another person with intent to gain \\nadvantage or obstructing a police officer under s. 129 of the Criminal Code.79 \\n[246] For the foregoing reasons I decline the relief the applicants seek with respect to s. \\n8(4) of the Act. \\n \\n                                                 \\n \\n78 Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, as amended. \\n79 Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, as amended. \\n2024 ONSC 1753 (CanLII)\\nPage: 86 \\n \\n \\nV.  Section 14(3) and the Reverse Onus Provision \\n \\n[247] Section 14(3) of the Act provides that the consent of an owner is presumed not to \\nhave been given and places the onus on the person charged to prove on the \\nbalance of probabilities that they obtained consent before engaging in the conduct \\nthey did. \\n[248] The applicants and, in particular, the intervenor Animal Alliance of Canada argues \\nthat this provision violates the presumption of innocence under s. 11(d) of the \\nCharter.  The applicants submit that the issue is particularly sensitive because \\neven a small misunderstanding can result in a conviction where the onus is based \\non a balance of probabilities rather than on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \\n[249] Reverse onus provisions have been upheld where the accused is in the best \\nposition to resolve the issue and prove the existence of an exemption.80  Here, it \\nis substantially easier for an accused to indicate who provided consent than it is \\nfor the Crown to check with and call as witnesses, every possible individual \\n(including former employees) to prove the absence of consent.81 \\n[250] The reverse onus provision is also consistent with s.  47(3) of the Provincial \\nOffences Act82 which provides: \\n                                                 \\n \\n80 R v Schwartz, [1988] 2 SCR 443, at para.80, 84; see also Regina v.

Lee\\'s Poultry Ltd,83 as a long-standing and broadly recognized exception to the \\nburden of proof as being justified under s. 1 of the Charter.  That holding has never \\nbeen reversed84  and is binding on me.   \\nConclusion and Disposition \\n[252] For the reasons set out above I declare that ss 9, 11(d) - (e); 12(1)(c) - (d); \\n12(2)(a)(i) - (ii); and 12(2)(c) of the Regulation infringe on the right to freedom of \\nexpression guaranteed under s. 2(b) of the Charter in a manner that is not saved \\nby s. 1 of the Charter and that those provisions are therefore of no force and effect.   \\n[253] During oral argument Ontario asked that,  in the event any elements of the Act \\nwere found to be unconstitutional, I suspend my ruling pending a hearing on  the \\npoint.

Morris and Blake Bochinski, for the Defendants/Responding \\nParties  \\nHEARD: \\nMarch 20, 2024 \\nENDORSEMENT \\n \\nOverview \\n[1] \\nThis is a motion by the plaintiff, Gay Reardon, for an order for disclosure of documents \\ncontained in the solicitor’s file for the estate of Margaret Reardon or, in the alternative, production \\nto the court for inspection to determine the validity of the claim of privilege. The defendants, Mark \\nand Francis Reardon, have produced three of the documents sought by Gay1 but they maintain that \\nthe remaining documents are covered by solicitor-client and/or litigation privilege. Mark and \\nFrancis say that the privileged nature of the remaining documents is readily apparent from the \\nsurrounding circumstances but if the court concludes otherwise, the documents ought to be \\nproduced for inspection by the court.     \\n[2] \\nFor the following reasons, I order that certain documents are to be produced to the court \\nfor inspection in order to determine the validity of the claim of privilege. The balance of the motion \\nis dismissed. \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 I have used first names in this endorsement for clarity. \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nBackground facts \\n[3] \\nMargaret had five children: Christopher, Mark, Francis, Peter, and Moninna. Gay was \\nChristopher’s wife. \\n[4] \\nMargaret died on June 28, 1992. Christopher was appointed as the trustee of her estate. \\nUnder the terms of Margaret’s will, each of her children was to share equally in her estate. \\n[5] \\nChristopher died on February 12, 2015. When Gay was appointed estate trustee of \\nChristopher’s estate, she learned that Christopher had not completed the administration of \\nMargaret’s estate. In May 2015, Gay retained Nicol & Lazier LLP to assist her with the \\nadministration of Christopher and Margaret’s estates. \\n[6] \\nIn August 2015, Gay consented to Mark and Peter taking over as succeeding estate trustees \\nof Margaret’s estate and she agreed to Nicol & Lazier representing Mark and Peter going forward. \\nOn August 18, 2015, Gay sent a letter to Mark, Francis, Peter, and Moninna, detailing \\nChristopher’s administration of the estate and providing the documents she had located. In \\nSeptember 2015, the siblings consented to Francis becoming a succeeding estate trustee of \\nMargaret’s estate instead of Peter. Mark and Francis were appointed succeeding estate trustees of \\nMargaret’s estate in October 2015. \\n[7] \\nAs the estate trustees, Mark and Francis continued to be represented by Nicol & Lazier \\nuntil June 2018 when they retained Perley-Robertson, Hill & McDougall LLP.   \\n[8] \\nOn January 26, 2019, Mark wrote to the other beneficiaries proposing a distribution of 50 \\nper cent of the residue of the estate in one-fifth equal shares. The next day, Gay wrote to Mark \\nadvising that he should account for the past distributions to the other beneficiaries before \\nconcluding that a distribution of equal one-fifth shares would result in an equal distribution in \\naccordance with Margaret’s wishes. \\n[9] \\nOn February 27, 2019, Mark and Francis wrote to Gay to advise that based on their review, \\nthere had been almost $260,000 in “unaccounted for” withdrawals and cash transactions between \\n1992 to 2000. Mark and Francis asked Gay if she had copies of Christopher’s personal bank \\nrecords for this period of time to see whether any “estate business” had been conducted through \\nthese personal records. Gay responded that she had no such records. \\n[10] \\nOn May 27, 2019, Mark and Francis wrote to the other beneficiaries, including \\nChristopher’s estate, regarding their distribution of the residue of Margaret’s estate. In their letter, \\nthey stated: \\n\\uf0b7 there had been $259,961.86 in “unaccounted for” debits and withdrawals made by \\nChristopher over the years 1992 to 2000; \\n\\uf0b7 after reducing the “unaccounted for” debits and withdrawals to account for funeral \\nexpenses, undocumented distributions, and an executor fee, they considered the \\ncurrent value of “unaccounted for” withdrawals credited to Christopher to be \\n$97,025.60; \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Margaret’s estate would “forgive” Christopher this amount; \\n\\uf0b7 they had distributed $1,142996.48 in equal shares to themselves, Peter, and \\nMoninna; and  \\n\\uf0b7 no distribution would be made to Christopher’s estate.  \\n[11] \\nOn July 26, 2019, Gay’s counsel sent a demand letter to Mark and Francis’ counsel seeking \\nan immediate distribution to Christopher’s estate of the amount previously distributed to the other \\nbeneficiaries. \\n[12] \\nGay’s statement of claim was issued on February 10, 2021.2 In her capacity as estate trustee \\nof Christopher’s estate, Gay seeks an order that all property and assets forming part of Margaret’s \\nestate be vested pending final resolution of the litigation, an order that Mark and Francis pass their \\naccounts as estate trustees from September 16, 2015 to date, a declaration that they have breached \\ntheir fiduciary duties, damages for breach of trust, and payment of the amount found to be due to \\nher on taking the accounts. \\n[13] \\nMark and Francis delivered their statement of defence and counterclaim on April 6, 2021.3 \\nIn their counterclaim, Mark and Francis as estate trustees for Margaret’s estate, claim against Gay \\nin her personal capacity and as estate trustee for Christopher’s estate, an order for equitable tracing \\nand production of all of Margaret, Christopher, and Gay’s banking and financial records for the \\nperiod June 28, 1992 to September 18, 2015, and damages for negligence, breach of trust, breach \\nof fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment in respect of Christopher and Gay’s actions in the \\nadministration of Margaret’s estate.  \\nThe disputed documents \\n[14] \\nWith three exceptions, the defendants maintain that the documents listed in Schedule B to \\ntheir affidavit of documents are protected by solicitor-client privilege and litigation privilege. The \\ndefendants have produced document nos. 171, 172, and 179 of Schedule B to their affidavit of \\ndocuments. Each of these documents is from the Nicol & Lazier file. Document nos. 171 and 172 \\nare solicitor’s notes of two phone calls received from Gay in May 2015 regarding some potential \\nestate work. Document no. 179 is an email from Matthew Reardon (Mark’s son who, at the time, \\nwas a lawyer at Nicol & Lazier and later moved to Perley-Robertson) to all the beneficiaries of \\nMargaret’s estate. \\n[15] \\nThe disputed documents fall into two broad categories: (i) those that Gay says are from the \\ntime period when she was the client of Nicol & Lazier (document nos. 173-177); and (ii) document \\nnos. 1-170 and 178-205 in respect of which Gay says the defendants “have not differentiated \\nbetween those documents pertaining to the administration of Margaret’s estate and those pertaining \\nto the litigation involving Margaret’s estate.” \\n                                                 \\n \\n2 Amended on November 26, 2021. \\n3 Amended on February 15, 2022. \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nApplicable legal principles   \\n[16] \\nThe applicable legal principles are not in dispute. \\nSolicitor-client privilege  \\n[17] \\nSolicitor-client privilege attaches to communications between a lawyer and their client for \\nthe purpose of seeking or giving legal advice which is intended to be confidential: Sky Solar \\n(Canada) Ltd. v. Economical Mutual Insurance Co., at para. 78.4 Solicitor-client privilege is \\nfundamental to the proper functioning of the legal system and should only be set aside when \\nabsolutely necessary: Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. University of Calgary, \\nat paras. 26 and 34.5 The party asserting the privilege bears the onus of establishing an evidentiary \\nbasis for the claim of privilege on a balance of probabilities: Sky Solar, at para. 73. \\n[18] \\nA trustee cannot claim solicitor-client privilege as against a beneficiary over any \\ndocuments related to advice sought and obtained with respect to the administration of the trust: \\nBallard Estate (Re),6 cited in Whitell v. Whitell, at para. 19.7 This is because a trustee and a \\nbeneficiary have a joint interest in the administration of the trust and the legal advice sought by \\nthe trustee furthers the interest of the beneficiary: Ballard Estate. As Lederman J. explained in \\nBallard Estate: \\nThus, there is no need to protect the solicitor-client communication from \\ndisclosure to those very persons who are claiming under the estate. The \\ncommunications remain privileged as against third parties who are \\nstrangers or are in conflict with the estate but as was stated in Stewart v. \\nWalker, supra, not those who are claiming under the estate. And that is \\nbecause the trustee and beneficiary have a joint interest in the advice as \\nPhipson has suggested: \\nNo privilege attaches to communications between solicitor and \\nclient as against persons having a joint interest with the client \\nin the subject matter of the communication, e.g. as between … \\ntrustee and cestui que trust. (Phipson on Evidence, 14th ed. \\n(London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1990)).   \\n[19] \\nHowever, a beneficiary’s entitlement to obtain communications between a trustee and the \\ntrustee’s counsel is not unlimited: Whitell, at para. 20. The court will not allow the production of \\nany documents related to “a separate and distinct estate matter in which the parties [are] adverse”: \\nWhitell, at para. 20, citing Wells (Estate) v. The Society for Pastoral Counselling Research, at \\n                                                 \\n \\n4 2015 ONSC 4714. \\n5 2016 SCC 53. \\n6 (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 50 (Gen. Div.). \\n7 2020 ONSC 2310. \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nparas. 15-16;8 Chang v. Lai Estate, at para. 17.9 This is because where the beneficiary and the \\ntrustee are adverse in interest, there is no joint interest that compels the disclosure of \\ncommunications that would normally be protected by solicitor-client privilege: Ballard Estate; \\nChang, at para. 17. \\n[20] \\nA second exception to a beneficiary’s entitlement to obtain communications between a \\ntrustee and the trustee’s counsel was identified by Lederman J. in Ballard Estate: where trustees \\nare given discretionary trusts which involve a decision on matters between beneficiaries. The \\nparties agree that this exception has no application to this case. \\n[21] \\nA further qualification, relied upon by Gay, was identified by Lederman J. in Ballard \\nEstate: \\nMoreover the cases have stated that, whatever approach to the claim of \\nprivilege is taken, in actions where the beneficiary is alleging lack of good \\nfaith or breach of fiduciary duty, this information is to be made available \\nto him or her. In Froese v. Montreal Trust Co. of Canada … the Master put \\nit this way at para. 27: \\nI am of the opinion that in the context of litigation in which the \\nplaintiff alleges breach of duty in the administration of a trust \\nand the documents which are sought to be examined are \\nrelevant to that issue the plaintiff may succeed on the basis of \\nproprietary right if he makes out a prima facie case that he is a \\nbeneficiary of the trust and establishes that the documents are \\ndocuments prepared by the trustee in the administration of the \\ntrust and in the course of the trustee carrying out his duties as \\ntrustee.  \\n[22] \\nGay alleges that the defendants’ decision on May 5, 2019 to distribute $1,142,496.48 to \\nthemselves, Peter, and Moninna, but not to Christopher’s estate, was a breach of trust.   \\nLitigation privilege \\n[23] \\nThe defendants also claim litigation privilege over the disputed documents. A party \\nasserting litigation privilege over a document must establish that litigation was contemplated at \\nthe time the document was created and the document for which privilege is claimed was created \\nfor the dominant purpose of the litigation: Sky Solar, at para. 80.10   \\nApplication of the legal principles to the disputed documents  \\n                                                 \\n \\n8 2014 ONSC 347. \\n9 2014 BCSC 128. \\n10 2015 ONSC 4714. \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\n[24] \\nI have considered the disputed documents in the following order: (i) document nos. 1-148; \\n(ii) document nos. 150-170; (iii) document nos. 173-177; (iv) document nos. 149, 178, and 180-\\n200; and (v) document nos. 201-205. \\nDocument nos. 1-148 \\n[25] \\nDocument nos. 1-148 of Schedule B to the defendants’ affidavit of documents consist of \\nemails and correspondence between Perley-Robertson and the defendants from September 20, \\n2019 to October 6, 2023. Gay says that solicitor-client privilege does not apply based on the \\nprinciples discussed in Ballard Estate and there is no “separate and distinct matter” so as to engage \\nthe adverse in interest exception. \\n[26] \\nGay acknowledges that these documents “may” be covered by litigation privilege but says \\nthat based on the descriptions in Schedule B, “it is impossible to tell.” Gay says that these \\ndocuments should be produced to the court for inspection to determine the validity of the claim for \\nprivilege.  \\n[27] \\nThere is no need for the court to inspect these documents for privilege. I am satisfied that \\nthey relate to a matter, separate and distinct from the administration of the estate in general, in \\nwhich the parties are adverse in interest. In her written submissions, Gay acknowledges that on \\nFebruary 27, 2019, the defendants alleged there were unaccounted for withdrawals from \\nMargaret’s estate. In July 2019, Gay’s counsel sent a letter demanding an immediate distribution \\nto Christopher’s estate. As the defendants put it, this is the very “crux” of the litigation between \\nthe parties – the litigation stems from Gay’s dispute with respect to the distribution of the estate. \\nThe parties were clearly adverse in interest as at the date of these documents. There is no joint \\ninterest in the documents. \\n[28] \\nThese documents have been differentiated from those relating to the general administration \\nof the estate. This is evident from a review of Schedule A to the defendants’ affidavit of documents. \\nFor example, Schedule A includes the May 2, 2019 clearance certificate and the May 24, 2019 \\n“Transaction Record of CRA Rebate.pdf”, documents that, on their face relate to the general \\nadministration of the estate. \\n[29] \\nI conclude that document nos. 1-148 are protected by solicitor-client privilege.         \\nDocument nos. 150-170  \\n[30] \\nDocument nos. 150-170 of Schedule B to the defendants’ affidavit of documents consist of \\nemails and correspondence between Perley-Robertson and the defendants, and notes to file from \\nMay 8, 2019 to November 28, 2019. For the same reasons as for documents nos. 1-148, I conclude \\nthat document nos. 150-170 are protected by solicitor-client privilege.  \\n[31] \\nGay argues that document nos. 150-155 (from the time period May 8 to May 22, 2019) \\nlikely relate to the defendants’ decision to distribute funds in respect of which Gay has pleaded \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nbreach of trust and should be produced for this reason. I disagree. In Blanks v. Roberts,11 Lemay \\nJ. distinguished Whitell from the case before him, explaining, \\n74. Whitell stands for the proposition that, where a party in an estate \\nproceeding is alleging bad faith, the documents relating to that allegation \\nmust be produced. \\n75. However, Whitell is a decision in which there may actually have been \\nsome basis for the claims of bad faith. Whitell is distinguishable from this \\ncase because, in this case, there is no basis on the record before me for any \\nof Ms. Roberts’ claims of bad faith or fraud on the part of Mr. Blanks. In \\naddition, unlike in Whitell, Ms. Roberts is one of the Trustees as well as a \\nbeneficiary. She had access to all of the estate documentation throughout \\nthis case. \\n[32] \\n While Gay advances a claim for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of trust, there is no \\nbasis in the limited record before me on this motion to support Gay’s claims against either of the \\ndefendants. Document nos. 150-170 are protected by solicitor-client privilege and need not be \\nproduced. \\nDocument nos. 173-177 \\n[33] \\nDocument nos. 173-177 of Schedule B to the defendants’ affidavit of documents are from \\nthe Nicol & Lazier file. Document nos. 173-175 and 177 are notes to file dated June 9, August 4, \\nAugust 7, and August 14, 2015. Document no. 176 is described as a “memo from D. Lazier to \\nMatt Reardon regarding client call.” To place these notes and memo in context, on July 15, 2015, \\nafter she had retained Nicol & Lazier to assist her in the administration of Margaret’s estate, Gay \\nwrote to the other beneficiaries advising them what she had learned about the administration of \\nthe estate. Then, on August 9, 2015, Gay agreed that Mark and Peter could take over as estate \\ntrustees.    \\n[34] \\nGay maintains that these documents are not privileged and should be produced. The \\ndefendants say that these documents are protected by both solicitor-client privilege and litigation \\nprivilege. \\n[35] \\nThe claim for litigation privilege in these documents strikes me as dubious given that Gay’s \\ndemand letter was not sent until July 2019. The claim of solicitor-client privilege, including a \\ndetermination of whether the parties were adverse in interest in relation to a matter distinct from \\nthe general administration of the estate, cannot be properly assessed based only on the date and \\nbrief description of the documents set out in Schedule B. I also note that three of the documents \\npre-date Gay’s consent to Mark and Peter taking over as estate trustees and that document nos. \\n171 and 172 (from May 2015) have already been produced.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n11 2020 ONSC 7133. \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\n[36] \\nIn these circumstances, document nos. 173-177 are to be produced to the court for \\ninspection in order to determine the validity of the claim of privilege.    \\n \\n \\n \\nDocument nos. 149, 178, and 180-200  \\n[37] \\nDocument no. 149 is from Matt Reardon’s Perley-Robertson file and consists of emails \\nbetween Mark, Francis, D. Ho-Faloon, and Matt Reardon dated from September 28 to October 1, \\n2018. Given the dates of these emails, document no. 149 is to be produced to the court for \\ninspection in order to determine the validity of the claim of privilege. \\n[38] \\nDocument nos. 178 and 180-200 are from the Nicol & Lazier file. These documents include \\nemails, notes to file, and letter correspondence and are dated from August 18, 2015 to June 8, \\n2018. Given the dates of these documents, they are to be produced to the court for inspection in \\norder to determine the validity of the claim of privilege.     \\nDocument nos. 201-205  \\n[39] \\nDocument nos. 201-205 of Schedule B to the defendants’ affidavit of documents are \\nlitigation counsel’s notes to file, a memo to file re telephone conference, and litigation counsel’s \\ndictation. The documents are dated from September 16, 2019 to October 5, 2023. They post-date \\nGay’s demand letter in the summer of 2019 and document nos. 203-205 post-date the \\ncommencement of the action in February 2021. The parties were adverse in interest at the time \\nthese documents were created; there is no joint interest in the documents. They are protected by \\nsolicitor-client privilege. Litigation privilege is also properly claimed for these documents given \\nthat litigation was clearly contemplated (or underway) when these documents were created and the \\ninvolvement of litigation counsel makes plain that they were created for the dominant purpose of \\nlitigation.   \\nConclusion  \\n[40] \\nDocument nos. 149, 173-177, 178, and 180-200 are to be produced to the court for \\ninspection in order to determine the validity of the claim of privilege. The balance of the motion \\nis dismissed.  \\n[41] \\nFollowing my determination of the validity of the claim of privilege, the parties may \\nprovide me with their submissions on costs of the motion. \\n  \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nJustice Ryan Bell \\n \\nDate: April 2, 2024  \\n2024 ONSC 1851 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\nCITATION: Reardon v.

KRAFT, J. \\n[1] \\nThe parties were never married. The applicant, Matthew Christopher Periera (“the father”), \\nage 34, and the respondent, Kristina Berezonsky (“the mother”), age 35, are the parents of a girl, \\nA., age 5, who resides primarily with the mother.  \\n[2] \\nPursuant to the order of Akazaki, J., dated April 6, 2023, the father’s Application, dated \\nMay 21, 2021, and all of the claims contained within it, except for parenting, were struck. The \\nmother was granted permission to proceed with her claims by way of an uncontested trial. \\n[3] \\nWhen the father issued the within Application on May 21, 2021, he was represented by \\nHayley Dilazzaro. At that time, A. was 3 years of age. The mother had commenced an Application \\nin the Ontario Court of Justice in October 2020. Her Application was stayed when the father \\ncommenced this Application. The father sought, among other things, shared decision-making \\nresponsibility for A.; equal parenting time with A., including holidays; a right of first refusal if the \\nresident parent cannot look after A. overnight; an order that neither parent be permitted to relocate \\nwith A. outside of the City of Toronto without written consent; child support for A.; security for \\nchild support; an order requiring both parents to maintain A. as a beneficiary on any employer \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nprovider medical and dental benefits; and an equity claim for a constructive trust interest in the \\nmother’s condominium in Toronto, based on the doctrine of unjust enrichment. \\n[4] \\nAccording to the father, the parties began cohabiting in February 2017 and separated in \\nFebruary 2020. According to the mother, the parties never cohabited. \\n[5] \\nThe mother’s uncontested trial has been heard by me in writing. These reasons set out my \\nfindings and disposition of the matters at issue. \\nRelief Sought \\n[6] \\nThe mother seeks the following relief: \\na. An order that both parents have full access to records and information about A. \\nfrom all third-party professionals and service providers and the father be permitted \\nto obtain these records directly and not through the mother; \\nb. An order permitting the mother to travel with A. outside of Canada without the \\nfather’s consent; \\nc. An order permitting the mother to obtain and renew all government issued \\ndocumentation for A., without the father’s consent or signature; \\nd. An order that A. reside primarily in the mother’s care; \\ne. An order that the father have supervised parenting time with A. in the community \\non alternated Saturdays for up to six hours through a supervision service;  \\nf. In the alternative, the father to have regular parenting time with A. on alternate \\nweekends from Friday, at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday, at 6:00 p.m., with parenting \\nexchanges to take place at a police station; \\ng. An order that the father be responsible for all fees and costs associated with \\nsupervision; \\nh. An order that the mother have discretion to change the father’s regularly scheduled \\nparenting time if A. has another engagement at that time provided, she provides the \\nfather with make-up parenting time if his regularly scheduled time has to be \\nchanged; \\ni. An order that A. be with the mother every year on Mother’s Day, Christmas Eve, \\nChristmas Day, New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Dad, Easter Weekend (Friday \\nthrough Monday); and A.’s birthday; \\nj. An order that neither parent speak negatively about the other parent to the child; \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nk. An Order for police enforcement of the parenting order if necessary; \\nl. An order that the father pay the mother child support for the month of December \\n2022 in the sum of $502 based on his annual income of $55,266.24; \\nm. An order that the father pay the mother child support for the period January 1, 2022 \\nto and including October 1, 2023, in the sum of $530 a month based on his annual \\nincome of $57,300; \\nn. An order that the father pay the mother child support commencing November 1, \\n2023 and on the first day of each following month based on an imputed income of \\n$68,000 a year in the sum of $634 a month; \\no. An order that the father pay his proportionate share of the child’s day care and other \\ns.7 expenses at the ratio of 47% from January 1, 2023 to and including October 31, \\n2023; \\np. An order that the father pay his proportionate share of the child’s prospective s.7 \\nexpenses for the period starting November 1, 2023, at the ratio of 49%; \\nq. An order that the father pay the mother table child support arrears of $3,600, s.7 \\nexpense arrears of $6,194.44, and costs of $700, for a total of $10,494.44; and,  \\nr. An order that the father pay the mother costs of her motion to strike the father’s \\npleadings and this uncontested trial in the sum of $9,000. \\n[7] \\nThe manner in which the father has participated in this litigation is a relevant consideration \\nto be taken into account in considering the relief that is being sought by the mother, for reasons \\ndescribed below.  \\nBackground Information \\n[8] \\nThe parties met online on May 25, 2017. The mother became pregnant within 2 months of \\nthe parties meeting. According to the mother, the parties never cohabited. The mother describes \\nthe father as being dishonest, aggressive, jealous, having an alcohol and substance abuse problem \\nand stealing from her. She describes feeling unsafe around the father and the relationship as being \\nfraught with abuse. \\n[9] \\nSince the relationship ended, the mother deposes that the father’s anger and control issues \\nescalated, making co-parenting impossible. \\n[10] \\nThe mother started a proceeding in the Ontario Court of Justice on October 21, 2022. The \\nfather did not file an Answer but repeatedly threatened to start a proceeding in this court to pursue \\na constructive trust interest in her condominium by way of an unjust enrichment claim, even though \\naccording to the mother, he never lived in her condominium. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n[11] \\nThere were several first appearances in the OCJ where the father was granted, on consent, \\nmultiple extensions of time to file his Answer. Despite this, the father failed to do so, repeating his \\nintention to start a proceeding in this court. For seven months, he did not do so. He also did not \\nfile an Answer or any responding materials in the OCJ proceeding. \\n[12] \\nOn April 19, 2021, counsel for the mother wrote to the father’s counsel stating as follows: \\n“It seems your client’s only intention at this point is to control and delay. Despite \\nasking for filing extensions and adjournments since October 2020, your client \\nindicates that he will not file an Answer in the OCJ while simultaneously threatening \\nthat if Ms. Berezovsky requests that he be noted in default, he will seek costs. This \\nis simply not fair. Your client has been given 6 months to file pleadings. \\nRespectfully, if Ms. Berezovsky moves to note your client in default, it will be a \\nresult of his own conduct. \\n \\nYour client has also been threatening to bring emergency Motions for increased \\nparenting time since November 2020. Ms. Berezovsky offered in the last  \\ncorrespondence to set this matter down for the earliest possible Case Conference to \\naddress the parenting time that your client continues to complain about. However, \\nhe’s not interested in doing that either.” (Emphasis added) \\n \\n[13] \\nOn May 31, 2021, the father commenced this Application. Since then, the mother submits \\nthat he has continued to delay, making it very difficult for her obtain court orders. He is in breach \\nof multiple courts orders, including orders for child support, disclosure, and costs. He did not \\nappear at two court dates, including the mother’s motion to strike his pleadings. Further, he did \\nnot file materials for four case conferences. \\nLitigation History \\n[14] \\nThe first case conference in this court was conducted on January 31, 2022 before Sharma, \\nJ. The Endorsement indicates that the parties had exchanged Draft Minutes of Settlement, settling \\nall issues. The Minutes were to be signed and a consent order was to be sent to Sharma, J. for his \\nsignature. This never happened. The Minutes were not signed.  \\n[15] \\nOn May 2, 2022, the father’s solicitor, Dayna Shoot was removed as solicitor of record for \\nthe father by an order of Pinto, J. \\n[16] \\nOn May 30, 2022, the parties were scheduled to attend a Settlement Conference before \\nDiamond, J. The father sought an adjournment to enable him to retain counsel. The Endorsement \\nstates that the parties were following an agreement where the father would pay monthly child \\nsupport to the mother of $520 a month and as of May 30, 2022, the father owed the mother arrears \\nof child support for four months in the sum of $2,008. Diamond, J. adjourned the conference to \\nJuly 11, 2022, and required the father to serve and file a conference brief by July 6, 2022. Costs of \\nthe May 30, 2022 attendance were reserved to the judge hearing the July 11, 2022 conference. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n[17] \\nOn July 11, 2022, the case conference came back before Sharma, J. The father remained \\nunrepresented and did not file a  case conference brief. He asked for a further adjournment because \\nhe claimed he could not find counsel to represent him. Sharma, J. was not satisfied that the father \\nwas taking his obligations under the Family Law Rules seriously. He refused to grant the \\nadjournment and noted that that there was a wasted appearance on May 30, 2022 and no progress \\nsince that date. Sharma, J. made the following order: \\na. The parties are to communicate by email only and respond to each other’s \\ncommunications within 48 hours, in a civil and polite manner. If a party does not \\nrespond, then the other party was to exercise decision-making unilaterally; \\nb. The father’s parenting time of alternating weekends and one mid-week video \\nconference call was to continue, with the father being responsible for pick-ups and \\ndrop offs, until further court order; \\nc. The mother was to provide another weeknight video-conference call for the father \\nto call the child; \\nd. Neither party was to speak negatively about the other party; \\ne. The father was ordered to pay costs for this conference and the May 30 2022 \\nattendance in the sum of $700, payable forthwith; \\nf. The mother was to serve a Form 20-Request for Information on the father by July \\n29, 2022 and the father was to respond by August 26, 2022; \\ng. On a temporary, without prejudice basis, the father was to pay the mother $502 a \\nmonth in table child support starting August 1, 2022 for A., to be enforced by the \\nFRO; and \\nh. The issue of arrears of child support and/or s.7 expenses to be addressed at a later \\nSettlement Conference. \\n[18] \\nOn October 21, 2022, the parties attended a Settlement Conference (“SC”) before Pinto, J. \\nThe Endorsement states that the father was earned $57,300 at that time, and the issues discussed \\nincluded parenting time, disclosure, child support, s.7 expenses and decision-making. The father \\nindicated that he was prepared to drop his property related claim. Costs of the conference were \\nreserved to the motion to trial judge. \\n[19] \\nOn December 23, 2022, the parties had a further SC before Kristjanson, J. The \\nEndorsement states, among other things, that  \\na. this was the fourth successive conference where the father had failed to file any \\nmaterials;  \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nb. the father did not appear at the virtual conference despite the fact that the court \\ncalled him and he was advised of the date and zoom link prior to the conference; \\nc. the father is in breach of court orders and has an outstanding unpaid costs order;  \\nd. the father was given one last chance to comply with the outstanding orders by \\nJanuary 16, 2023, failing which the mother had leave to bring a motion pursuant to \\nRule 1(8) to proceed with an uncontested trial where the father would have no right \\nto participate;  \\ne. the father was to file an updated form 13.1 Financial Statement by January 16, \\n2023;  \\nf. costs of the October 21, 2022 conference of $1,500 were ordered to be paid by the \\nfather by January 16, 2023; and  \\ng. costs were to be enforced trough the FRO. \\n[20] \\nThe father did not meet the January 16, 2023 deadline. He never paid the costs. He never \\nfiled an updated sworn financial statement. Accordingly, on April 6, 2023, Akazaki, J. struck the \\nfather’s pleadings and all claims, other than parenting, and granted the mother permission to \\nproceed with her claims by way of an uncontested trial.  \\nIssues to be Decided \\n[21] \\nThe issues to be decided on this uncontested trial are as follows: \\nParenting Orders  \\na. Is it in A.’s best interests for the mother to have sole decision-making responsibility \\nover the major decisions that impact her? \\nb. Is it in A.’s bests interest to reside primarily with the mother and to have supervised \\nparenting time with the father, or to have parenting time with the father on alternate \\nweekends, from Fridays at 6:00 p.m. to Sundays, at 6:00 p.m.? \\nc. Is it in A.’s best interests for the mother to have permission to travel with her and \\nobtained all of her government issues documentation without the need for the \\nfather’s consent? \\nChild Support Orders  \\nd. Does the father owe the mother child support arrears and if so, in what amount? \\ne. Does the father owe the mother retroactive child support starting on November 1, \\n2022? \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nf. What is the father’s child support obligation on a prospective basis? \\nRestraining Order \\ng. Should a permanent restraining order against the father be granted? \\nCosts \\nh. What amount of costs should the mother be awarded for this uncontested trial and \\nfor her motion to strike the father’s pleadings?  \\nParenting Orders: \\n[22] \\nIn terms of A.’s parenting, the issues that need to be resolved include:  \\na. Is it in A.’s best interests for the mother to have sole decision-making responsibility \\nover the major decisions that impact her? \\nb. Is it in A.’s bests interest to reside primarily with the mother and to have supervised \\nparenting time with the father, or is in her best interests to maintain her regular \\nparenting time with her father on alternate weekends from Friday, at 6:00 p.m. to \\nSunday, at 6:00 p.m.? \\nc. Is it in A.’s best interests for the mother to have permission to travel with her and \\nobtained all of her government issues documentation without the need for the \\nfather’s consent? \\n[23] \\nSince the parents are not married, the Children’s Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12 \\n(“CLRA”) is the applicable statute that governs this matter. \\n[24] \\nIn making a parenting order with respect to A., the court shall only consider her best \\ninterests: s. 24(1).  \\n[25] \\nIn determining what is in A.’s best interests, I am required to consider all factors related to \\nA.’s circumstances and, in doing so, I am required to give primary consideration to her physical, \\nemotional, and psychological safety, security and well-being; s. 24(2). \\n[26] \\nThe best interests factors are set out in s.24(3) of the CLRA and reproduced below: \\n(a)  the child’s needs, given the child’s age and stage of development, such as \\nthe child’s need for stability; \\n(b)  the nature and strength of the child’s relationship with each parent, each of \\nthe child’s siblings and grandparents and any other person who plays an \\nimportant role in the child’s life; \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\n(c)  each parent’s willingness to support the development and maintenance of \\nthe child’s relationship with the other parent; \\n \\n(d)  the history of care of the child; \\n \\n(e)  the child’s views and preferences, giving due weight to the child’s age and \\nmaturity, unless they cannot be ascertained; \\n \\n(f)  the child’s cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and \\nheritage, including Indigenous upbringing and heritage; \\n \\n(g)  any plans for the child’s care; \\n \\n(h)  the ability and willingness of each person in respect of whom the order \\nwould apply to care for and meet the needs of the child; \\n \\n(i)  the ability and willingness of each person in respect of whom the order \\nwould apply to communicate and co-operate, in particular with one another, on \\nmatters affecting the child; \\n \\n(j)  any family violence and its impact on, among other things, \\n \\n(i)  the ability and willingness of any person who engaged in the family \\nviolence to care for and meet the needs of the child, and \\n(ii)  the appropriateness of making an order that would require persons in \\nrespect of whom the order would apply to co-operate on issues affecting the \\nchild; and \\n \\n(k)  any civil or criminal proceeding, order, condition or measure that is relevant \\nto the safety, security and well-being of the child. 2020, c. 25, Sched. 1, s. 6. \\n \\nFactors relating to family violence \\n \\n(4) In considering the impact of any family violence under clause (3) (j), the \\ncourt shall take into account, \\n \\ni. the nature, seriousness and frequency of the family violence and \\nwhen it occurred; \\nii. whether there is a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour in \\nrelation to a family member; \\n \\niii. whether the family violence is directed toward the child or whether \\nthe child is directly or indirectly exposed to the family violence; \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\niv. the physical, emotional and psychological harm or risk of harm to the \\nchild; \\n \\nv. any compromise to the safety of the child or other family member; \\n \\nvi. whether the family violence causes the child or other family member \\nto fear for their own safety or for that of another person; \\n \\nvii. any steps taken by the person engaging in the family violence to \\nprevent further family violence from occurring and improve the \\nperson’s ability to care for and meet the needs of the child; and \\n \\nviii. any other relevant factor. 2020, c. 25, Sched. 1, s. 6. \\n \\n[27] \\nI am able to consider the father’s past conduct only if it is relevant to the exercise of his \\ndecision-making responsibility, parenting time or contact with respect to A.: s. 24(5).  \\nIs it in A.’s bests interest to reside primarily with the mother and to have supervised \\nparenting time with the father, or is in her best interests to maintain her regular parenting \\ntime with her father on alternate weekends from Friday, at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday, at 6:00 \\np.m.? \\n[28] \\nIn making an order for parenting time, I am required to give effect to the principle that a \\nchild should have as much time with each parent as is consistent with the best interests of A.: s. \\n24(6). \\n[29] \\n The best interests of the child have been found to be met by having a loving relationship \\nwith both parents and that such a relationship should be interfered with only in demonstrated \\ncircumstances of danger to the child’s physical or mental well-being. Moreover, the child has a \\nright to have contact with both parents. See: Klymenko v. Klymenko, 2020 ONSC 5451. \\n[30] \\nThe party who seeks to reduce normal access will usually be required to provide a \\njustification for taking such a position. The greater the restriction sought, the more important it \\nbecomes to justify that restriction. M.A. v. J.D., 2003 CanLII 52807 (ON CJ), [2003] O.J. No. 2946 \\n(OCJ). \\n[31] \\nThe person seeking supervised access bears the burden of establishing that supervision is \\nnecessary. See: Klymenko v. Klymenko, supra. \\n[32] \\nCurrently, the father has parenting time with A. on alternating weekends from Fridays, at \\n6:00 p.m. to Sunday evenings, at 6:00 p.m., with the parenting exchanges taking place at the \\nmother’s home. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\n[33] \\nThe mother believes it is in A.’s best interests to continue to have a relationship with the \\nfather, however, she submits that A.’s parenting time ought to be supervised on an ongoing basis, \\nfor the following reasons: \\na. Prior to the court proceedings being commenced, the mother deposes that the father \\nhad a psychologist who had referred him to have a formal psychiatric assessment. \\nThe father’s psychologist advised the mother that the father had repeatedly stated \\nthat he would stop at nothing to destroy the mother’s quality of life and seek \\nrevenge. The psychologist passed away and was not able to write a letter in support \\nof the mother. The mother was doing individual therapy sessions with the \\npsychologist from September 2019 until she died in December 2021. \\nb. The father’s conduct during parenting exchanges demonstrates that he is regularly \\ncombative, uncooperative and abusive toward the mother. This conduct takes place \\nin front of A. without any regard for the impact this may have on her. \\nc. The father has sent paranoid, strange and threatening emails to the mother on a \\nregular basis. He has been unpredictable in terms of his caring for A. He has \\nregularly called the police during parenting exchanges. Some examples of these \\nincidents include the following: \\ni. On March 28, 2022, a police officer from 52 Division called the mother to \\nadvice that the father was potentially missing and inquired as to whether the \\nmother knew of his whereabouts because he had not shown up at work for \\n3 weeks; \\nii. On May 19, 2023, the mother wanted to take A. to her cousin’s birthday \\nparty during his weekend. The father responded that A would not be going \\nto her cousin’s birthday party. He threatened to call the police if the mother \\ndid not bring her to McDonalds for parenting exchange. \\niii. On October 6, 2023, when the father arrived at parenting exchange at he \\nmother’s home, the mother asked him to confirm that he would be dropping \\nA. off on Sunday at 6:00 p.m. as per the court order. The father became \\naggressive and insisted that he would not return A. until Monday because it \\nwas a long weekend. However, the court order did not give the father \\nadditional parenting time on long weekends. Once the father admitted his \\nintention to withhold A. the mother brought A. back into her home. The \\nfather called the police and waited for them in a parking lot for 2 hours. \\nWhen the mother tried to leave her home with A. to take her to McDonalds \\nto eat, the father drove back to the mother’s house and blocked her driveway \\nwith his car, so she could not leave. The police arrived and the father \\nconfirmed to the police that he would return A. on the Sunday.  \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n[34] \\nThe Court does not find that it is in A.’s best interests to supervise the father’s parenting \\ntime. That would adversely affect the amount and quality of A.’s parenting time with the father. \\nHowever, the court makes this finding with some reservation. The court is concerned about the \\nfather’s ability to separate his own emotional needs from those of A. If he undermines the security \\nof A.’s relationship with the mother or he exposes A. to conflict, a future court may have to revisit \\nthis issue.  \\n[35] \\nThe father has never had supervised parenting time with A. There was never a motion \\nbrought by the mother that his parenting time needed supervision either in the OCJ proceeding or \\nthis proceeding. Given the father’s refusal to participate in this proceeding, if a supervision order \\nis made, a review of that decision will be necessary and it is not likely that the father will participate \\nin that hearing.  \\n[36] \\nI note that the mother asked for alternative relief namely, that the father’s regular parenting \\nschedule with A. take place on alternate weekends from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. \\nwith parenting exchanges to take place at the Durham Regional Police Station. I find that it is in \\nA.’s best interests that the father’s regular parenting schedule continue on alternate weekends with \\nthe exchanges taking place at the Durham Police Station.  \\nHoliday Schedule \\n[37] \\nThe mother seeks to have A. in her care for every Mother’s Day. That order is granted. \\n[38] \\nThe mother seeks to have A. in care every Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, New Year’s \\nEve and New year’s Day. I decline to grant this order. The father shall have some time with A. on \\nChristmas Day or New Year’s day. To facilitate this, the father shall advise the mother in writing \\nby October 30th in each year, starting with October 30, 2024, what time he wishes to spend with \\nA. during Christmas Day and New Year’s Day for a maximum of 4 hours. The mother shall \\nrespond to the father within 48 hours of receiving his requested time as to whether the times \\nproposed are agreeable. In even-numbered years, starting with 2024, the mother shall have the first \\nchoice of the time the father has with A. on either Christmas Day or New Year’s Dad and in odd-\\nnumbered years, the father shall have the first choice of the time he has with A. on either Christmas \\nDay or New Year’s Day. \\nParenting Exchanges \\n[39] \\nGenerally, ordering parenting time exchanges to take place at a police station is not \\nsupporting. As set out in K.M. v. J.R., 2022 ONSC 111, the court articulated the following \\nproblems with doing so: \\na. It sends messaging to children that their world is not safe and the exchanges are \\ndangerous; \\nb. That someone love is dangerous or unsafe. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nc. Transitions become anxiety-provoking; \\nd. The police are not equipped for this. \\ne. It is adult-focused, not child focused. \\n[40] \\nDespite these problems, the court has considered that a starting point to assess a child’s \\nbest interests when making a parenting order is to ensure that a child will be physically and \\nemotionally safe: K.K.H. v. A.A.B., 2024 ONCH 113 (CanLII). It is also in a child’s best interests \\nwhen making a parenting time order that his or her caregiver be physically and emotionally safe. \\nSee I.A. v. M.Z., 2016 ONCJ 615; Armstrong v. Coupland, 2023 ONSC 5451l; J.N. v. A.S., 2020 \\nONSC 5292; A.L.M. v. V.L.A., 2020 ONCH 502; M.R.-J. v. K.J., 2020 ONCH 305; Abbas v. \\nDowney, 2020 ONCH 283; N.D. v. R.K. 2020 ONCJ 266.  \\n[41] \\nGiven the conflict that has taken place at parenting exchanges, I am persuaded that it is in \\nA.’s best interests for the exchanges to take place at the Durham Police Station, as requested by \\nthe mother. \\nIs it in A.’s best interests for the mother to have sole decision-making responsibility over the \\nmajor decisions that impact her? \\n[42] \\nThe mother seeks sole decision-making responsibility for the major decisions that impact \\nA. In determining whether this is in A.’s best interests, I have considered the best interests factors \\nset out in s.24(3) of the CLRA, and make the following findings: \\na. The mother has consistently tried to communicate with the father and encourage \\nhim to take an interest and be involved in decision-making regarding A. The father \\nhas declined to take part or give any opinion about these important decisions. \\nExamples of these attempts on the mother’s part include the following: \\ni. The mother asked the father to communicate with her through the co-\\nparenting application Our Family Wizard and he never responded; \\nii. The mother asked the father to attend co-parenting therapy with her and he \\nadvised he would only do so if she agreed to no longer have child support \\nenforced through the Family Responsibility Office; \\niii. For A.’s dance recital on February 26, 2022, which fell during the father’s \\nweekend parenting time, the mother emailed the father the details. The \\nfather ignored her. On the weekend of the recital, the father decided to \\nforfeit his weekend with A. The father did not show up at A.’s dance recital \\nwhich caused her to be sad and disappointed; \\niv. On March 3, 2022, the mother emailed the father’s about A.’s new daycare \\nplacement. The father did not respond. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\nv. On May 9, 2022, the mother emailed the father to discuss A.’s kindergarten \\nprogram for the 2022/2023 school year. The father did not respond; \\nvi. On July 29, 2022, the mother emailed the father with details regarding \\nregistration and costs for A.’s dance school. On September 1, 2022, the \\nmother forwarded the father an email she had received from the dance \\nschool, regarding dance attire and associated costs. The father did not \\nrespond to either email; \\nvii. On September 2, 2022, the mother forwarded an email to the father \\nregarding the parenting schedule and a meet and greet date at A.’s school. \\nThe father never responded, \\nviii. On October 31, 2022, the mother asked the father to sign A.’s passport \\napplication, explaining that she hoped to travel with A. sometime in 2023, \\nbut that she did not have any actual travel plans. The father accused the \\nmother of having travel plans and lying. The father did not respond further. \\nix. On November 10, 2022, the mother emailed the father advising him to \\nattend the parent-teacher interview for A. The father never responded and \\ndid not attend the Zoom parent-teacher interview. \\nb. It is clear based on the above incidents that the father is not willing to support the \\ndevelopment and maintenance of A.’s relationship with the mother. It is abundantly \\nclear that the mother has demonstrated a consistent willingness to support the \\ndevelopment and maintenance of A.’s relationship with her father. \\nc. It is also clear from the above that the mother has demonstrated an ability and \\nwillingness to communicate and cooperate with the father on all matters affecting \\nA. To the contrary, the father appears disinterested, disengaged and/or unwilling to \\ncooperate with the mother to co-parent A. \\nd. The father appears to have a past history of fabricating allegations about A. in an \\neffort to show the mother in a bad light. These attempts on his part are detailed \\nbelow: \\ni. On December 27, 2021, the father called the mother accusing the daycare \\nof inappropriately disciplining A. When the program manager asked the \\nfather for details about this allegation, the father ignored her and did not \\nrespond; \\nii. On May 6, 2022, the father claimed that A. was limping due to a fight in \\ndaycare. When the mother asked for the details, the father did not respond. \\nThe mother reached out to A.’s daycare provider who told the mother that \\nA. was not in a fight or limping. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\niii. On May 11, 2022, a supervisor from Weewatch Agency contacted the \\nmother regarding an email the father had sent her about a report. The mother \\ninquired with the father about what report he was seeking. The father never \\nresponded. \\niv. On August 2, 2022, the mother emailed the father about a new allegation he \\nhad made to the daycare that another child had assaulted A. The daycare \\ntold the mother that this allegation was false. \\nv. The father regularly emails the mother 1-3 times each week stating “access \\ndenied” on days when he does not have regularly scheduled parenting time. \\nvi. On September 5, 2022, the father asked the mother to have an important \\nphone call. The mother requested that he email her. The father emailed her \\nthat evening stating that A. had told the pediatrician that the maternal \\ngrandmother’s husband hit her, yelled at her and pushed her. The father also \\nstated in the email that A. told him that maternal grandmother’s husband \\nhas been making A. touch him. The father went on to explain that the \\npediatrician has informed CAS in accordance with his statutory obligation \\nto do so and that until the matter is investigated, he did not give consent to \\nA. to be at the maternal grandmother’s home. Shortly after that, the father \\nposted a picture sitting on a hospital bed with A. \\nvii. On September 6, 2022, the mother picked up A. from the father’s home and \\nrequested information about the hospital visit, the date, physician’s name \\netc. The father never responded. \\nviii. The mother also contacted the CAS and advised that the allegations made \\nby the father were unequivocally false.  \\nix. On September 12, 2022, the caseworker from CAS visiting the mother and \\nA. at the mother’s residence. She showed the mother the doctor’s office \\nreport, confirming that the father pulled the doctor aside and told the doctor \\nabout A.’s allegations. A. never made the allegations or disclosure to the \\ndoctor herself. \\nx. On September 21, 2022, the Family Service Worker from CAS advised the \\nmother they had no further concerns and no reason to investigate further. \\nxi. In March 2023, an “anonymous” call was made to the CAS to report another \\nallegation about A.’s maternal grandfather. The CAS worker came to do \\nanother home visit at the mother’s home and then closed the case. The CAS \\nworker suggested to the mother that she and A. receive counselling to help \\ncope with the father’s abusive behaviour. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\ne. Based on the above, I find that the father’s conduct of fabricated allegations \\namounts to concerning behavior that is abusive and controlling. As a result, it \\nconstitutes family violence. In accordance with s.24(3)(j), it is questionable as to \\nwhether the father has the ability to meet the needs of A. when he has demonstrated \\na willingness to make false allegations causing A. and the mother to be investigated \\nby the CAS.  \\nf. The Supreme Court of Canada in Barendregt v. Grebliunis, 2022 SCC 22 made the \\nfollowing observations about family violence: \\nThe recent amendments to the Divorce Act recognize that findings of \\nfamily violence are a critical consideration in the best interests analysis \\n(par. 146). \\nThe suggestion that domestic abuse or family violence has no impact on \\nthe children and has nothing to do with the perpetrator’s parenting ability \\nis untenable. Research indicates that children who are exposed to family \\nviolence are at risk of emotional and behavioural problems throughout \\ntheir lives: Department of Justice, Risk Factors for Children in Situations \\nof Family Violence in the Context of Separation and Divorce (February \\n2014), at p. 12. Harm can result from direct or indirect exposure to \\ndomestic conflicts, for example, by observing the incident, experiencing \\nits aftermath, or hearing about it: S. Artz et al., “A Comprehensive \\nReview of the Literature on the Impact of Exposure to Intimate Partner \\nViolence for Children and Youth” (2014), 5 I.J.C.Y.F.S. 493, at p. 497. \\n(par. 145). \\nDomestic violence allegations are notoriously difficult to prove. Family \\nviolence often takes place behind closed doors and may lack \\ncorroborating evidence. Thus, proof of even one incident may raise \\nsafety concerns for the victim or may overlap with and enhance the \\nsignificance of other factors, such as the need for limited contact or \\nsupport (par. 145). \\ng. \\n In cases of family violence, particularly spousal violence, it is crucial that the court \\nconsider whether a co-operative parenting arrangement is appropriate. A victim of \\nfamily violence might be unable to co-parent due to the trauma they have \\nexperienced or ongoing fear of the perpetrator. In addition, co-operative \\narrangements may lead to opportunities for further family violence. See: Bell v. \\nReinhardt, 2021 ONSC 3353. Accordingly, I find it would be inappropriate in these \\ncircumstances to make an order that would require these parents to attempt to \\ncooperated on issues affecting A. \\nh. The history of A.’s care is that she has been in the mother’s primary care and the \\nmother has provided a stable, consistent home and routine for her. In contrast, the \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\nfather has demonstrated an inability to follow the parenting schedule and shows \\ncomplete disregard for A.’s needs and best interests by his inability to be a stable \\nand predictable caregiver to her. I make this finding based on the following \\nexamples: \\ni. On December 3, 2021, the father did not pick up A. at daycare as he was \\nscheduled to do. He did not notify the mother. The mother was called by the \\ndaycare staff indicating that the father did not show up. The mother left \\nwork early to retrieve A. \\nii. On December 17, 2021, the daycare staff called the mother to advise that \\nthe father never showed up to pick A. up. Again, the mother left work early \\nto retrieve A. \\niii. On December 26, 2021, the mother asked the father in-person at a parenting \\nexchanged to confirm that he would be picking up A from day care for his \\nparenting time the following weekend. The father did not answer; \\niv. On January 2, 2022, the parents agreed that A. would return to her home \\nthat event. The father never showed up at 6:00 p.m. the scheduled exchange \\ntime. The mother emailed, texted, and called the father as she was worried. \\nHe texted the mother back at 6:53 p.m. and said he decided he would drop \\noff A. on either January 3 or 4. On January 3, 2022, the father dropped A. \\noff late at 6:30 p.m. without any prior communication. \\nv. On March 13, 2022, the father was 45 minutes later for drop off without \\nnotice to the mother; \\nvi. On April 9, 2022, A.’s birthday fell on the father’s weekend. The father \\nwould not confirm dates or times when the mother was asking him. In the \\nend, the father forfeited his parenting time with A. \\nvii. On April 19, 2022, the mother emailed the father to confirm a pickup and \\ndrop off time and location for his weekend falling on April 22-24, 2022. \\nThe father initially ignored the mother’s correspondence. When he did \\nrespond, he was difficult agreeing to concrete times. \\nviii. On August 28, 2022, A. was scheduled to return to the mothers care at 6:00 \\np.m. The father refused, claiming he did not have a vehicle. The mother \\nemailed him to ask when he would have a vehicle and whether he would \\ndrop off A at daycare the following morning. The father never responded. \\nix. On September 4, 2022, the mother emailed the father asking to confirm \\nwhether A. would be dropped off at 6:00 p.m. The father replied that it was \\na long weekend and accused the mother of not sending him the school \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\nschedule, asking if A. was registered in school. The mother had sent the \\nfather the school schedule and sent it to the father again. The father refused \\nto drop off A. and, instead demanded that the mother pick up A. from his \\nhome on September 6, 2022. \\nx. On September 9, 2022, the father forfeited his weekend with A. without \\nexplanation. \\nxi. On October 24, 2022, the father was 30 minutes late for drop off without \\nnotice. \\nxii. On November 6, 2022, the father kept A. overnight without agreement and \\ncontrary to the order; \\nxiii. On November 20, 2022, the father refused to drop off A. without prior \\nnotice and ignored the mother’s question as to why A. had not been \\nreturned. The mother called the police to do a wellness check. The father \\nasked the police to bring A. home to the mother, which they told him was \\nnot possible. The mother immediately went to the father’s home with the \\npolice present for safety reasons; \\nxiv. On A.’s birthday weekend April 9, 2023, the father told the mother he would \\nnot allow A. to speak with the mother on A.’s birthday. The mother was \\ndistressed and panicked and brought A. back into her home. The father \\nstarted to videotape the mother and called the police. The mother released \\nA. into the father’s care in good faith and with police assistance, under the \\nagreement that she be allowed to call A. on her birthday and that the father \\nwould return A. to the mother’s residence on time. The father did allow the \\nmother to have a three-minute call with A. on her birthday. \\ni. In terms of A.’s needs, given her young age and stage of development, the court \\nhas concerns about the father’s ability to meet these needs, including her need for \\nstability. I make these findings based on the following facts: \\ni. A. tells the mother that when she is with the father she sleeps on the couch. \\nThe mother has asked the father for pictures of his residence to be sure that \\nA. has a bed there but the father refuses to provide one. \\nii. A.’s daycare reports that when A. comes to daycare after having a weekend \\nwith her father, her behaviour is different, including lying. \\niii. The father has difficulty caring for A.’s hair. On October 11, 2021, A. \\nreturned to the mother with shampoo and conditioner still in her hair, not \\nwashed out. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\niv. On December 18, 2022, A. had an accident on the drive back from the \\nfather’s home to the mother’s homes. A. told the mother that the father had \\ntaken photographs of her body and she asked him to stop because it made \\nher uncomfortable. The mother emailed the father about this incident. He \\ndenied doing this. \\n[43] \\nFor all of the above reasons, I find that it is in A.’s best interests that she remains in the \\nprimary care of the mother. I also find that it is in A.’s best interests for the mother to have sole \\ndecision-making responsibility for A. These parties do not have a history of being able to \\ncommunicate effectively and co-parenting and/or joint decision-making is not possible.  \\n[44] \\nThe mother seeks the discretion to change the father’s parenting time if A. has another \\nengagement at that time and to provide the father with make-up notice. I decline to grant this order. \\nIf A. has a special event to attend, the mother shall give notice of that event to the father. The \\nfather shall make best efforts to be flexible to ensure that A. does not miss important events for \\nextended family and close friends. If the father is not willing to take A. to the event, the mother \\nshall be permitted to take A. during the father’s time and then return A. to his care for the remainder \\nof the parenting time. \\nIs it in A.’s best interests for the mother to have permission to travel with her and obtained \\nall of her government issues documentation without the need for the father’s consent? \\n[45] \\nI find it is in A.’s best interests for the mother to be permitted to travel with her outside of \\nCanada without the need for the father’s permission and for her to be permitted to obtain and renew \\nall government-issued documentation, such as passports, health cards, etc. without the need for the \\nfather’s consent. \\nChild Support \\n[46] \\nThe child support issues I need to determine are as follows: \\na. Does the father owe the mother child support arrears and if so, in what amount? \\nb. Does the father owe the mother retroactive child support starting on November 1, \\n2022? \\nc. What is the father’s child support obligation on a prospective basis? \\n[47] \\nPursuant to s.31 of the Family Law Act, R.S.O., c.F.3 (“FLA”), every parent has an \\nobligation to pay child support. \\n[48] \\nAn order for the support of a child should recognize that each parent has an obligation to \\nprovide support for the child, and apportion the obligation according to the child support \\nguidelines: s. 33(7) of the FLA. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\n[49] \\nThe Ontario Child Support Guidelines, O. Reg. 391/97 (“CSG”) state that the amount of \\nan order for the support of a child under the age of majority is the amount set out in the applicable \\ntable, according to the number of children and the income of the parent against whom the order is \\nsought: s.3(1). \\nDoes the father owe the mother child support arrears and if so, in what amount? \\n[50] \\nIn terms of child support arrears, the mother seeks an order that the father pay her arrears \\nof child support in the sum of $3,600 and arrears of s.7 expenses in the amount to $6,194.44. She \\nspecially asks for the total amount of these arrears, plus $700 in costs, for a lump sum of \\n$10,474.44, payable by December 1, 2023. These costs of $700 are those that the father was \\nordered to pay the mother on July 11, 2022 and did not pay. She asks that these costs be enforceable \\nas child support through the Family Responsibility Office. \\n[51] \\nAttached as Exhibit “JJ” to the mother’s Form 23C is the FRO case balance summary as \\nof November 15, 2023. This case balance shows that the father is in support arrears of $4,642.29, \\nmade up of arrears of child support pursuant to a court order of $4,242.29, plus fees of $400.  \\n[52] \\nThe mother did not put forward any other evidence on the record to demonstrate that the \\nfather owes arrears of table child support of $3,600 or arrears of s.7 expenses of $6,194.44, as \\nclaimed. There was no chart detailing the time frame of these arrears. Further, there was no list of \\ns.7 expenses or details outlining the amounts paid by the father toward s.7 expenses or the balance \\nof what is owing. \\n[53] \\nBased on the record before me, I order the father to pay child support arrears to the mother \\nof $4,642.29 as per the FRO case balance summary, plus the prior order of costs of $700, for a \\ntotal sum of child support arrears and costs of $5,342.29, payable forthwith. \\nDoes the father owe the mother retroactive child support starting on December 1, 2021? \\n[54] \\nThe mother seeks retroactive child support as follows: \\na. The sum of $502 a month for December 1, 2021, based on the father’s income of \\n$55,266.24 for 1 child; \\nb. The sum of $530 a month for the period of January 1, 2022 to and including October \\n31, 2023, based on the father’s income of $57,300. This amounts to $11,660 for \\nthis 22-month period;  \\n[55] \\nThe total amount of retroactive child support being sought by the mother, therefore \\namounts to $12,162.  \\n[56] \\nThe mother’s Form 23C, however, does not outline what the father paid during this same \\nperiod. It appears from the order of Sharma, J., dted July 11, 2022, that the father was ordered to \\npay $502 a month as child support to the mother, starting August 1, 2022. However, the \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\nEndorsement of Diamond, J., dated May 30, 2022 references an earlier agreement of the parties \\nthat the father was paying voluntary child support of $502 a month. \\n[57] \\nAccordingly, there is an overage of child support owing for period January 1, 2022 to and \\nincluding October 31, 2023, according to the mother of $28 a month because it appears the father \\nwas paying $502 a month in child support based on his income of $55,266.24, instead of $530 a \\nmonth a month in child support, based on the income he earned in 2022 of $57,300. If I am correct, \\nthis would mean that the father would owe retroactive child support of $616, calculated as $28 a \\nmonth x 22 months for the period January 1, 2022 to and including October 31, 2022.  \\n[58] \\nIn terms of retroactive s.7 expenses, the mother seeks an order that the father pay 47% of \\nthe child’s s.7 expenses being childcare and camp fees, dance classes, skating classes, swimming \\nclasses, and the after-insurance costs of the child’s medical and dental expenses for the period \\nstarting January 1, 2023 to and including October 31, 2023. The mother’s Form 23C does not set \\nout the total cost of these s.7 expenses. Nor does her affidavit set out what the father contributed \\ntoward A.’s section 7 expenses, if anything. \\n[59] \\nAs a result, I am not able to make a retroactive child support order without further evidence \\nfrom the mother. \\nWhat is the father’s child support obligation on a prospective basis, starting November 1, \\n2023? \\n[60] \\nThe mother seeks prospective child support for A. under the CSG based on an imputed \\nincome for the father of $68,000 a year, starting November 1, 2023, in the sum of $634 a month \\nfor the parties’ one child. As well, she seeks an order that the father pay 49% of the child’s ongoing \\nchildcare and camp fees, dance classes, skating classes, swimming classes and the after-insurance \\ncost of the child’s medical and dental expenses. \\nShould income be imputed to the father of $68,000 a year? \\n[61] \\nPursuant to s.16 of the CSG, the starting point in determining income for child support \\npurposes is the “Total Income”, also known as Line 15000 in the T1 General Form used for income \\ntax purposes, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III of the CSG. \\n[62] \\nThe father swore one financial statement in this proceeding, dated May 18, 2021, which \\nset out that his income was $54,396.48 a year. He consented to pay child support for A. on that \\nlevel of income as provided for in the order of Sharma, J., dated July 11, 2022. \\n[63] \\nAccording to the mother, the father orally disclosed to her that his income had increased to \\n$57,300. In fact, this income figure was referred to in the Endorsement of Pinto, J., dated October \\n22, 2022. However, the father’s child support never increased in accordance with that increased \\nincome figure. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\n[64] \\nPursuant to the order of Sharma, J., dated July 11, 2022, the FRO garnishes the father’s \\nincome pursuant to the Support Deduction order. The husband works for the Government of \\nCanada. As of November 3, 2023, FRO is deducting $1,010.73 from the father’s bi-weekly \\nincome, which represents 50% of his income. Given that this is the father’s net income, the mother \\nsubmits he earns $2,021.46 bi-weekly in net income or $52,558 a year, net which is the equivalent \\nto approximately $68,000 a year gross. It is on this basis that she asks that income be imputed to \\nthe father in this amount. \\n[65] \\nSection 19 of the CSG, sets out the authority for a court to impute income to a payor for \\nchild support. It states as follows: \\n19. (1) The court may impute such amount of income to a spouse as it considers \\nappropriate in the circumstances, which circumstances include the following: \\n(a) the spouse is intentionally under-employed or unemployed, other than where \\nthe under-employment or unemployment is required by the needs of a child of \\nthe marriage or any child under the age of majority or by the reasonable \\neducational or health needs of the spouse; \\n(b) the spouse is exempt from paying federal or provincial income tax; \\n(c) the spouse lives in a country that has effective rates of income tax that are \\nsignificantly lower than those in Canada; \\n(d) it appears that income has been diverted which would affect the level of child \\nsupport to be determined under these Guidelines; \\n(e) the spouse’s property is not reasonably utilized to generate income; \\n(f) the spouse has failed to provide income information when under a legal \\nobligation to do so; \\n(g) the spouse unreasonably deducts expenses from income; \\n(h) the spouse derives a significant portion of income from dividends, capital \\ngains or other sources that are taxed at a lower rate than employment or business \\nincome or that are exempt from tax; and \\n(i) the spouse is a beneficiary under a trust and is or will be in receipt of income \\nor other benefits from the trust. \\n[66] \\nPursuant to s.19(1)(f), the father has failed to provide income information when he is under \\na legal obligation to do so. Based on the information provided by the mother regarding the amounts \\nbeing garnished by FRO, I find that the father’s income for prospective child support purposes is \\n$68,000 a year.  \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\n[67] \\nThe CSG dictate that for one child, the Table child support obligation for the father is $634 \\na month, based on an annual income of $68,000. \\n[68] \\nIn terms of prospective s.7 expenses for A., the mother seeks an order that the father pay \\n49% of A.’s section 7 expenses. The mother’s sworn financial statement, dated July 29, 2022, \\nindicates that she is employed by the Royal Bank of Canada and her annual income is listed at \\n$70,688. The combined incomes of the parties are $138,688, which corresponds to the father’s \\nproportionate responsibility for A.’s s.7 expenses to be 49% and the mother’s proportionate \\nresponsibility to be 51%. \\n[69] \\nThe mother’s Form 23C does not list the cost of each s.7 expense she is claiming, nor does \\nshe set out which of these expenses are full-year or partial year. In order for the Court to determine \\nwhether a specific expense for a child qualifies as a legitimate s.7 expense, the court must consider \\nthe “necessity” of the expense in relation to the child’s best interests; and the “reasonableness” of \\nthe expense inf relation o the means of the parents and those of the child and to the family’s \\nspending pattern prior to separation: Titova v. Titov, 2012 ONCA 864. \\n[70] \\nIn addition, Ontario courts have generally held that a parent must provide the other with \\nreasonable notice of a s.7 expense before claiming a contribution. In other words, one parent cannot \\nunilaterally incur an expense for a s.7 expense and then claim a contribution from the other parent: \\nLuftspring v. Luftspring, 2004 CarswellOnt 1481 (ONCA). \\n[71] \\nDaycare is considered a legitimate s.7 expense if it is required to allow the primary parent \\nto attend employment. Similarly, the uninsured portion of medical and dental expenses for a child \\nin excess of $100 is a legitimate s.7 expense. \\n[72] \\nWhether or not A.’s summer camp fees, dance classes, skating classes and swimming \\nclasses qualify as s.7 expenses will depend on the cost of these expenses, the necessity of the \\nexpense and the reasonableness of these expenses. Again, the court has no information on the \\nrecord about these expenses with which to make such a determination. \\n[73] \\nAccordingly, while the mother has correctly calculated the father’s proportionate share he \\nwould have to pay toward A.’s s.7 expenses at 49%, I cannot determine what that amount would \\nbe without further evidence from the mother. \\nRestraining Order \\n[74] \\nThe mother is also seeking a restraining order against the father, pursuant to s.46 of the \\nFLA. Section 46(1) states that the court may make a final restraining order against a person \\ndescribed in subsection (2) if the applicant has reasonable grounds to fear for her own safety or for \\nthe safety of any child in her lawful custody.  \\n[75] \\nIn G.P. v. R.P., 2023 ONCJ 388, this court set out the legal principles to apply in \\ndetermining whether to grant a restraining order as follows: \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\na. Restraining orders are serious and should not be ordered unless a clear case has \\nbeen made out. See: Ciffolillo v. Niewelglowski, 2007 ONCJ 469. \\nb. Courts should not order restraining orders in borderline cases just to be cautious. \\nThat ignores the test and the onus of proof. See: A.H. v. M.T., 2023 ONSC 2365. \\nc. A restraining order is serious, with criminal consequences if there is a breach. It \\nwill also likely appear if prospective employers conduct a criminal record (CPIC) \\nsearch. This could adversely affect a person’s ability to work. It may affect a \\nperson’s immigration status. See: F.K. v. M.C., 2017 ONCJ 181. \\nd. It is not sufficient to argue that there would be no harm in granting the order. \\nSee: Edwards v. Tronick-Wehring 2004 ONCJ 195. \\ne. Courts should be hesitant to make the order simply because there was a similar \\norder in place before that has now expired. Orders expire. See: A.H. v. M.T., supra. \\nf. Before the court can grant a restraining order, it must be satisfied that there are \\n“reasonable grounds for the person to fear for his or her own safety or for the safety \\nof their child”. See: McCall v. Res, 2013 ONCJ 254. \\ng. The test for a restraining order is both objective and subjective. The legislation itself \\nmakes that clear, as an entirely subjective test would have no use for the words \\n“reasonable grounds” as a qualifier to the fear(s) expressed by the requesting party. \\nSee: A.H. v. M.T., supra; McGowan v. McGowan, 2018 ONSC 5950, at \\nparagraph  38.  \\nh. The relief is discretionary. While there are subjective and objective elements in the \\ntest, more is required than an expression of concern. There must be evidence as to \\nspecific events and a connection to the present situation. See: Noriega v. \\nLitke, 2020 ONSC 2970; S.S.L. v. M.A.B., 2022 ONSC 6326. \\ni. It is not necessary for a respondent to have actually committed an act, gesture or \\nwords of harassment to justify a restraining order. It is enough if an applicant has a \\nlegitimate fear of such acts being committed. An applicant does not have to have \\nan overwhelming fear that could be understood by almost everyone; the standard \\nfor granting an order is not that elevated. See: Fuda v. Fuda, supra.  \\nj. A restraining order cannot be issued to forestall every perceived fear of insult or \\npossible harm without compelling facts. There can be fears of a personal or \\nsubjective nature, but they must be related to a respondent’s actions or words. A \\ncourt must be able to connect or associate a respondent’s actions or words with an \\napplicant’s fears. See: Fuda v. Fuda, supra. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\nk. A restraining order will be made where a person has demonstrated a lengthy period \\nof harassment or irresponsible, impulsive behaviour with the objective of harassing \\nor distressing a party. There should be some persistence to the conduct complained \\nof and a reasonable expectation that it will continue without court \\ninvolvement. See: Purewal v. Purewal, 2004 ONCJ 195. \\nl. Courts should have regard for the passage of time. Events that once triggered a \\ntemporary restraining order may not be so compelling on the issue of a permanent \\norder. See: D.C. v. M.T.C., 2015 ONCJ 242; Jumale v. Mahamed, 2022 ONSC 566. \\nm. In borderline cases, the court must consider what other protections may be available \\nif a restraining order is not granted. See: D.C. v. M.T.C., supra; M.H.S. v. \\nM.R., 2021 ONCJ 665. \\nn. It is appropriate, in borderline cases, to consider the balancing prejudice to the \\nrespondent if the restraining order is granted. See: D.C. v. M.T.C., supra; M.H.S. v. \\nM.R., supra. \\no. A court is not precluded from making a final restraining order if a party has \\ncomplied with a temporary order under section 28 of the Act. On a temporary \\nmotion, the court does not have the benefit of the fulsome record it has at trial. \\nCross-examination at trial can provide valuable information in the court’s risk \\nassessment. Further, the court should be alert to the fact that parties may improve \\ntheir behaviour when the eyes of the court are on them. This might not continue \\nonce the case ends. See: F.K. v. M.C., supra. \\n[76] \\nSpecifically, the mother wants an order restraining the father from coming within 500 \\nmeters of her resident, her place of employment or anywhere where she is reasonably known to be \\nat any time or for any purpose. The restraining order would have to include an exception that the \\nfather could attend at a specific location for parenting exchange purposes. \\nApplication of the Law to the Facts \\n[77] \\nThe mother’s evidence is that she is frightened of the father and that he has been \\nemotionally, psychologically, financially and physically abusive toward her. She fears the father \\nbecause he is unpredictable, angry, and aggressive. I accept that she fears the father and for her \\nsafety. However, the analysis does not stop there. The test is a subjective-objective test as set out \\nin s.46 of the FLA. \\n[78] \\nThe mother maintains that in February 2020 she called the police when the father became \\nphysically violent with her. However, no police report was filed by the mother or is on the record \\nbefore the Court. \\n[79] \\nOn June 6, 2021, during a parenting exchange, the mother alleges that the father falsely \\naccused her of scratching the hood of his vehicle and was very aggressive. He came up to her face \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 25 \\n \\n \\nand threatened her in front of A. The mother contacted the police again at that time. Again, the \\nmother did not file a copy of the police report with her Form 23C. \\n[80] \\nI am not persuaded that the evidence on record supports the court making a restraining \\norder against the father for these reasons: \\na. There is no evidence of any police reports made by the mother against the father \\nfor violence; \\nb. Granting a restraining order could adversely affect the father’s future employment \\nor his ability to travel internationally; \\nc. The parenting exchanges will be taking place at a police station which minimizes \\nthe chance of family violence taking place at the mother’s home; and \\nd. The mother can be protected by making contact and communication orders pursuant \\nto section 28 of the CLRA. It is a more proportionate order in these circumstances. \\n[81] \\nSection 28 of the CLRA provides that the court can grant an order with respect to contact \\nbetween parents, determine any aspect of the incidents of the right for parenting time; and make \\nadditional orders as the court considers necessary and proper in the circumstances, including an \\norder: \\na. limiting the duration, frequency, manner or location of contact or communication \\nbetween any of the parties, or between a party and the child, \\nb. prohibiting a party or other person from engaging in specified conduct in the \\npresence of the child or at any time when the person is responsible for the care of \\nthe child, \\nc. prohibiting a party from changing the child’s residence, school or day care facility \\nwithout the consent of another party or an order of the court, \\nd. prohibiting a party from removing the child from Ontario without the consent of \\nanother party or an order of the court, \\ne. requiring the delivery, to the court or to a person or body specified by the court, of \\nthe child’s passport, the child’s health card within the meaning of the Health \\nInsurance Act or any other document relating to the child that the court may specify, \\nf. requiring a party to give information or to consent to the release of information \\nrespecting the child’s well-being, including in relation to the child’s health and \\neducation, to another party or other person specified by the court, or \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 26 \\n \\n \\ng. requiring a party to facilitate communication by the child with another party or \\nother person specified by the court in a manner that is appropriate for the child. \\n2020, c. 25, Sched. 1, s. 6. \\n[82] \\nAccordingly, this court orders that the parties shall not communicate about A. directly and \\nthat such communication take place only through Our Family Wizard, except in the case of an \\nemergency. I further order that neither party shall denigrate the other in front of A. or discuss their \\nlitigation in front of A. Finally, I order that neither party shall attend at each other’s residence for \\nparenting exchanges, unless there is a prior written consent or court order. There shall also be a \\nnon-harassment order. \\nCosts \\n[83] \\nThe mother seeks costs of the uncontested trial in the sum of $9,000 which sum includes \\nthe costs associated with her motion to strike his pleadings. \\n[84] \\nOn April 6, 2023, the mother brought a motion to strike the father’s pleadings. The father \\nis the applicant in this proceeding. He commenced the proceeding almost 2 ½ years ago. Despite \\nbeing the applicant, the father took no steps to advance the case.  \\n[85] \\nThe father was given multiple opportunities over the course of almost a year to bring \\nhimself into compliance with multiple court orders and fulfil the most basic financial disclosure \\nobligations. He did not file materials for four successive conferences in this court. He failed to file \\nany materials in response to the mother’s motion to strike. \\n[86] \\nThe mother served the father with an Offer to Settle on March 31, 2023. The father never \\nresponded. The father never served an Offer to Settle. The father did not attend the mother’s motion \\nto strike. \\n[87] \\nIn terms of the uncontested trial, the mother filed an extensive Form 23C. On October 18, \\n2022, the mother served the father with a global offer to settle all of the issues. \\n[88] \\nThe offer was never withdrawn by the mother. \\n[89] \\nThe terms of the offer to settle were more favourable that what the mother seeks in this \\nuncontested trial. \\n[90] \\nThere are three costs orders that have been made against the father, totaling $3,700. He has \\nnot paid these costs orders. \\n[91] \\nThe father’s conduct amounts to willful non-compliance with court orders and amounts to \\nbad faith. \\n[92] \\nThe mother also seeks an order that the costs be enforced as child support through the FRO. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 27 \\n \\n \\n[93] \\nIf the court determines that it would be appropriate to make an order for costs, then the \\nfactors to consider in setting the amount of costs are listed in r. 24(12). The court must consider \\nthe reasonableness and proportionality of the factors enumerated in the subrules as they relate to \\nthe importance and complexity of the issues. These factors include each party’s behavior; the time \\nspent by each party; any written offers to settle, including those that do not meet the requirements \\nof r. 18; any legal fees; any other expenses; and any other relevant matter.  \\n[94] \\nModern family costs rules are designed to foster four fundamental purposes: to indemnify \\nsuccessful litigants for the cost of litigation, to encourage settlements, to discourage and sanction \\ninappropriate behavior by litigants: and to ensure that cases are dealt with justly: Mattina v. \\nMattina, 2018 ONCA 867, 299 A.C.W.S. (3d) 770, at para. 10. The touchstone considerations of \\ncosts awards are proportionality and reasonableness: Beaver v. Hill, 2018 ONCA 840, 17 R.F.L. \\n(8th) 147, at para. 12. \\n[95] \\nIn Sims-Howarth v Bilcliffe, 2000 CanLII 22584 (ON SC), [2000] O.J. No. 330 (S.C.J.), \\nAston J. held that the two traditional scales of costs are no longer an appropriate way to quantify \\ncosts under the FLRs. He stated that, having determined that one party is liable to pay costs, the \\ncourt must fix the amount at some figure between a nominal sum and full recovery, having regard \\nto the factors set out in Rule 24, without any assumptions about categories of costs. This \\ncharacterization of costs under the FLRs was approved of by the Ontario Court of Appeal in C.A.M. \\nv D.M., 2003 CanLII 18880 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 3707 (C.A.), at para. 42.  \\n[96] \\nThe FLRs do not explicitly provide for costs on either a partial or substantial indemnity \\nscale. There is no general approach in family law of “close to full recovery costs”: Beaver, at para. \\n11. Rather, full recovery is only warranted in certain circumstances, such as bad faith under r. \\n24(8), or beating an offer to settle under r. 18(14): Beaver, at para. 13. \\n[97] \\nCosts must always be proportional to what is at stake in the case, and to the unsuccessful \\nparty’s reasonable expectation as to what costs he/she may face, if he/she is unsuccessful. In \\nappropriate circumstances, unreasonable behavior will result in a higher award of costs.  \\n[98] \\nI have reviewed the mother’s Bill of Costs. The Bill of Costs demonstrates that the expenses \\nrelated to the Motion to Strike and Uncontested Trial for the period March 7, 2023 to November \\n15, 2023 amounted to 24.3 hours at a rate of $350 an hour. I find these costs to be reasonable and \\nproportionate to the issues. \\n[99] \\nShe has been wholly successful and is presumptively entitled to costs. The father’s refusal \\nto participate in these proceedings, his willful breach of court orders, particularly when he is the \\napplicant in this case, amounts to unreasonable and bad faith conduct. \\n[100] Accordingly, I order the costs requested by the mother. \\n[101] The mother has asked that these costs be enforced by the FRO, since they relate to legal \\nfees incurred in relation to support, as is permitted under the Family responsibility and Support \\nArrears Enforcement Act, 1996, S.C. 1996, c.31. I so order. \\n2024 ONSC 1862 (CanLII)\\nPage: 28 \\n \\n \\nDisposition \\n[102] A final parenting order shall go as follows: \\na. The child shall have her primary residence with the mother. \\nb. The mother shall have sole decision-making responsibility over all decisions that \\nimpact the child. \\nc. The mother shall inform the father of any contemplated significant decision \\nregarding A. in writing. Within 7 days of receiving this information, the father may \\nprovide the mother with a written response containing his view.

SUGUNASIRI, J.: \\n \\nOverview: \\n[1] \\nThere is one thing that Mr. Huang and Ms. Chang can agree on about their son, Teddy, \\naged four: They do not have the healthy communication needed to share decision-\\nmaking.  Each parent requests sole decision-making and primary care. Teddy has lived in \\nthe primary care of his mother since he was born. He goes to school in her catchment \\narea in Scarborough. He visits with Mr. Huang on weekends from 6 p.m. on Friday to 7 \\np.m. on Sunday. CAS and the police have been involved with this family since his birth. No \\nindependent authority has concern about either parent’s ability to parent Teddy.  \\n[2] \\nWhile Teddy was in Ms. Chang’s primary care, Mr. Huang did not pay the appropriate \\namount of child support. This trial resolves parenting time, decision-making, retroactive \\nand ongoing child support.  \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n[3] \\nOn January 31, 2024, I released a bottom-line decision moving Teddy to live with Mr. \\nHuang and giving Mr. Huang sole decision-making. These are my reasons for that decision. \\n[4] \\nIn addition to moving Teddy from Ms. Chang to Mr. Huang, I find that Mr. Huang owes \\nMs. Chang $16,616 in retroactive child support. I offset this amount with child support \\nowing by Ms. Chang. She shall commence paying table child support on June 1, 2029, in \\naccordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines based on her income as reported \\non her income tax return for 2028. \\n[5] \\nI understand since my bottom-line order the parties have had to alter parenting time and \\nhave worked together on this. I direct the parties to provide me with an updated \\nparenting schedule which will include holidays and Teddy’s summer vacations which once \\napproved, will form part of my order. \\nAnalysis: \\nI. \\nThe Legal Framework \\n[6] \\nSection 16.1(1) of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3(2nd Supp.) (“DA”) gives the court the \\nauthority to make an order providing for the exercise of parenting time and decision-\\nmaking responsibility in respect of any child of the marriage on application by either \\nspouse. In this case, Mr. Huang applies for the court to exercise its jurisdiction in his \\nfavour. To determine who should have decision-making responsibility over Teddy and \\nhow much time each parent should spend with him, I look to section 16 of the DA. The \\ncourt can only consider the best interests of the child when making a parenting order. I \\ndetermine Teddy’s best interests by considering the factors set out in section 16(3) of the \\nDA: \\n(3) In determining the best interests of the child, the court shall consider all factors \\nrelated to the circumstances of the child, including \\n(a) the child’s needs, given the child’s age and stage of \\ndevelopment, such as the child’s need for stability; \\n(b) the nature and strength of the child’s relationship with each \\nspouse, each of the child’s siblings and grandparents and any \\nother person who plays an important role in the child’s life; \\n(c) each spouse’s willingness to support the development and \\nmaintenance of the child’s relationship with the other spouse; \\n(d) the history of care of the child; \\n(e) the child’s views and preferences, giving due weight to the \\nchild’s age and maturity, unless they cannot be ascertained; \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n(f) the child’s cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing \\nand heritage, including Indigenous upbringing and heritage; \\n(g) any plans for the child’s care; \\n(h) the ability and willingness of each person in respect of whom \\nthe order would apply to care for and meet the needs of the child; \\n(i) the ability and willingness of each person in respect of whom \\nthe order would apply to communicate and cooperate, in \\nparticular with one another, on matters affecting the child; \\n(j) any family violence and its impact on, among other things, \\n(i) the ability and willingness of any person who \\nengaged in the family violence to care for and meet the \\nneeds of the child, and \\n(ii) the appropriateness of making an order that would \\nrequire persons in respect of whom the order would \\napply to cooperate on issues affecting the child; and \\n(k) any civil or criminal proceeding, order, condition, or measure \\nthat is relevant to the safety, security and well being of the child. \\n[7] \\nWhere, as in this case, there are allegations of family violence, the DA requires me to \\nconsider: \\n(4) In considering the impact of any family violence under paragraph (3)(j), the \\ncourt shall take the following into account: \\n(a) the nature, seriousness and frequency of the family violence \\nand when it occurred; \\n(b) whether there is a pattern of coercive and controlling \\nbehaviour in relation to a family member; \\n(c) whether the family violence is directed toward the child or \\nwhether the child is directly or indirectly exposed to the family \\nviolence; \\n(d) the physical, emotional and psychological harm or risk of harm \\nto the child; \\n(e) any compromise to the safety of the child or other family \\nmember; \\n(f) whether the family violence causes the child or other family \\nmember to fear for their own safety or for that of another person; \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n(g) any steps taken by the person engaging in the family violence \\nto prevent further family violence from occurring and improve \\ntheir ability to care for and meet the needs of the child; and \\n(h) any other relevant factor. \\n \\n[8] \\nThe focus of the trial evidence reflects the parents’ lack of focus on Teddy’s best interests. \\nMost of the evidence relates to the conflict between the parents, what happened and \\nwhat did not happen between them, and the minutia of who was right or wrong in each \\nconversation or a particular altercation during a parenting time exchange. I will speak \\nmore about the tenure of these exchanges when considering family violence. Suffice it to \\nsay for the moment that they reflect a mother doing her best to care for her child while \\nin continual conflict with a father who does not treat her with respect and seems to lack \\nempathy for her lived experience. That said, the totality of the factors relevant to Teddy \\ncause me to conclude that it is in his best interest to live primarily with Mr.Huang.  \\n[9] \\nMr. Huang, Ms. Chang, Teddy’s paternal grandmother and Mr. Huang’s best friend all \\ntestified. Teddy is four years old and attends kindergarten where both his parents say he \\nis happy. He has lived with Ms. Chang since birth. Teddy enjoys sports and being outside. \\nAfter school Ms. Chang picks Teddy up and spends time in the playground with another \\nparent whose child Teddy is friends with. Ms. Chang and Teddy lived in a two-bedroom \\napartment where Teddy sleeps in Ms. Chang’s bed even though he has a Thomas the Tank \\nbed. Ms. Chang uses her second bedroom to pursue her business endeavours which \\ncurrently entails gathering internet nutritional information on various foods and products \\nincluding their interaction with medications, creating cards, and selling them online. Ms. \\nChang is engaged and Teddy spends some time with her fiancé. Currently she receives \\n$1800/month from ODSP, $800 in “baby bonus”, $150 “for some tax that you get every \\nmonth” and sporadic child support from Mr. Huang. From time to time Ms. Chang also \\nreceives $500/month from her father who is her only family support. Her intention is to \\ntry and get into real estate.  \\n[10] \\nThere was little evidence on what Teddy does during his time with Mr. Huang other than \\ngoing to church on Sundays and spending time with his mom, friends, and family in \\nEtobicoke. I accept the evidence from both Mr. Huang and his mother that she is very \\ninvolved in his and Teddy’ life. Mr. Huang currently lives in two different locations – on \\nthe weekends with his mother in Etobicoke, and in North York with his grandfather where \\nhe lives during the week. He does not currently have his own place. If Teddy is moved to \\nreside with Mr. Huang, he will be living with Mr. Huang and his grandfather during the \\nweek. This means that Mr. Huang and Teddy will have to take public transportation to \\nTeddy’s school in Scarborough before Mr. Huang then goes to work. He works from home \\non some days and has a flexible schedule to allow him to pick Teddy up on some \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nweekdays. Otherwise, Teddy’s great-grandfather or grandmother will  pick him up after \\nschool. On those days, Mr. Huang expects that he will be home from work at about 6 p.m. \\n[11] \\nThis family has been in conflict since Teddy’s birth. He has been exposed to this conflict \\nand the numerous visits from the CAS and the police. In all cases, the CAS did not raise \\nconcerns with either person’s ability to parent. At various times in 2020 and 2021 Ms. \\nChang alleged that Mr. Huang physically assaulted her. The police investigated and found \\nno evidence of assault. They concluded on two occasions that a person (whose name was \\nredacted in the police records that formed trial exhibit 16), had altered photos offered as \\nproof of the injuries arising from the alleged assaults.  \\n[12] \\nBut there were altercations. Mr. Huang aggressively grabbed Teddy’s stroller handle. He \\nagreed on cross-examination that he placed his hands on Ms. Chang to remove her from \\na computer on which she was allegedly displaying pornography. His tone, was no doubt \\nas harsh as they appear in texts and email exchanges, when Mr. Huang was frustrated \\nwith Ms. Chang. Mr. Huang strikes me as unyielding in how he sees the world and how he \\nexpects Teddy to be raised. Mr. Huang exercised control over Ms. Chang by withholding \\nchild support and instead providing her with the supplies he believed Ms. Chang needed \\nto care for Teddy. This is contrary to law. The payor cannot control how child support is \\nused by the recipient nor can they withhold it because they do not like what they think \\nthe recipient is doing with the money. I have explained this to Mr. Huang.  \\n[13] \\nMs. Chang also fuelled the fire. On multiple occasions she alleged that Mr. Huang was \\nsexually assaulting Teddy and called him a “pedo”. Again, the police investigated, as did \\nthe CAS and they found no evidence of sexual assault or any harm caused by Mr. Huang \\nto Teddy.  To this day Ms. Chang insists that she has a head injury from Mr. Huang’s \\naggression but there is no medical corroboration of this injury. I accept that Ms. Chang \\nhonestly holds this belief but I do not accept as fact in this trial that Ms. Chang has a head \\ninjury due to an assault by Mr. Huang.   \\n[14] \\nDespite Mr. Huang’s troubling attitude toward Ms. Chang, I have three areas of concern \\nthat cause me to conclude that it is in Teddy’s best interest to be with Mr. Huang as the \\nprimary parent: \\na. Teddy’s Medical care; \\nb. Schooling; and \\nc. Exposure to adult sexual activity. \\n \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMedical care \\n[15] \\nSince Teddy was born, he has had a toenail infection, an eye stye that lasted for months, \\nlong colds, possible bed bug bites, and red dots on him that Ms. Huang diagnosed as \\nchicken pox. On those occasions, I find that Ms. Chang erred on the side of not taking \\nTeddy to a doctor. There was reference in her testimony to doctors but she tendered no \\ndoctor’s records beyond an ER record when she once found Teddy unresponsive. My \\nimpression from Ms. Chang’s testimony is that she relies a great deal on the internet to \\nself-diagnose as well as to diagnose symptoms that Teddy is displaying. For example, she \\nadvised Mr. Huang that Teddy’ had chicken pox yet there was no such diagnosis from the \\ndoctor. Ms. Chang’s business idea that she will gather information on the internet to \\nadvise people on how medicines interact with nutrients is one example of this reliance. \\nAnother is her stated self-diagnosis of diabetes based on her symptoms and the \\npurported side effects of a head injury that has never been diagnosed as far as the record \\nis concerned. \\n[16] \\nMs. Chang admits in testimony that Teddy has had unusually long colds but attributes it \\nto lactose intolerance. However, Ms. Chang has not taken Teddy to a doctor to confirm \\nthis. It has been a significant source of disagreement with Mr. Huang and might have been \\neasily resolved by a doctor. Instead, the dispute continues over whether Mr. Huang \\nshould continue to give Teddy yogurt. Teddy’s eye stye remained untreated for at least \\ntwo months until Mr. Huang got drops. At times both parents agree that Teddy was \\nunderweight and potentially undernourished. Ms. Chang ascribes it to Mr. Huang \\nremoving Teddy for several days thereby preventing him from nursing. Mr. Huang \\nbelieves that Ms. Chang was not feeding Teddy as required but instead relied almost \\nexclusively on breastmilk even at an age when solids are the norm. I find Mr. Huang’s \\nevidence on this point more credible. I conclude that it is more likely than not that Teddy’s \\nweight issues were linked to Ms. Chang’s nutritional choices for him. \\n[17] \\nMr. Huang is the opposite – he errs on the side of consulting a doctor any time Teddy \\nseems unwell. One might say his tendency is to overreact and consult professionals at \\nevery turn. This is clear from his repeated calls to CAS and the police when Ms. Chang was \\nlate for an exchange or when Teddy seemed under the weather. On the other hand, it \\nwas Mr. Huang’s intervention that addressed Teddy’s eye infection. In an ideal world, \\nTeddy should benefit from the watchful eye of both parents who cooperate to get him \\nthe medical attention he needs in a timely way. Unfortunately, Mr. Huang and Ms. Chang \\ncannot offer that unified support to Teddy. Sometimes this happens and is why this court \\nhas legislative and common law authority to intervene with a child-centered approach. \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\n[18] \\nParenting decisions should never be held to a standard of perfection and there is not one \\nway to approach a child’s health. However, I am forced to choose a primary parent and \\ndecision-maker in this case.  My choice is between a parent who more likely than not, \\nrelies heavily on the internet to address her child’s medical issues versus a parent who \\npotentially overuses the healthcare system when his child is unwell. Putting Teddy’s best \\ninterest at the center of my decision, I err on the side of Mr. Huang’s approach. This pulls \\ntoward putting Teddy in Mr. Huang’s primary care. \\nSchooling \\n[19] \\nSince starting school in September of 2023,  Teddy has been absent 12 days and late on \\nthree days.  Ms. Chang stated that the record is inaccurate. She would let Teddy sleep in \\nor stay home if he was unwell, again relying on her belief of his lactose intolerance which \\nhas never been medically confirmed. Ms. Chang testified that if Teddy was late the school \\nwould call. If they called and Ms. Chang did not answer, they would likely have marked \\nhim absent even if he was there.  No one from the school testified nor was there evidence \\nthat Ms. Chang asked the school about her theory.  \\n[20] \\nThe record does not support Ms. Chang’s evidence on this point. Mr. Huang’s regular \\nparenting time was every weekend. One would expect Teddy’s absences to favour \\nMondays on the theory that Teddy would be sick from yogurt intake on the weekend. \\nTeddy’s absences as they appear on the school’s records do not show such a pattern and \\nI have no further evidence on this point.  On the other hand, Ms. Chang also testified that \\njunior kindergarten was not mandatory and so she did not think it mattered if he stayed \\nhome from time to time. This latter testimony aligns more with the record. I find the \\nformer testimony to reflect Ms. Chang’s inclination to diagnose Teddy herself. \\n[21] \\nBased on his testimony and manner, I assess Mr. Huang to be a more formalistic person \\nwho believes in structure and discipline. Mr. Huang is not content with Teddy’s record of \\nattendance. Further, he expresses concern about Teddy’s speech development and lack \\nof toilet training at age 4. Ms. Chang agrees that Teddy was not toilet trained by \\nkindergarten. She explains Teddy’s language deficits to being shy with Mr. Huang due to \\nthe infrequency of their contact. Mr. Huang’s mother echoes these concerns and testified \\nthat Teddy does not seem to be able to express himself the way she would expect \\nsomeone of his age. Again, Mr. Huang’s insistence on speech therapy may be overkill – \\nbut I find that that it benefits Teddy’s overall well being more than Ms. Chang’s approach. \\nThis favours Teddy being in Mr. Huang’s primary care.  \\n[22] \\nTo be clear, the fact that Teddy was not toilet trained by the time he started junior \\nkindergarten is not in and of itself a reason to move Teddy from the only home he has \\nknown.  Rather, I consider the matrix of factors particular to Teddy, as far as the evidence \\npermits me, to conclude that Ms. Chang’s overall relaxed approach is not in Teddy’s best \\ninterest.  This is despite however well-meaning Ms. Chang is and her success in raising \\nTeddy so far. Both parents agree that Teddy seems to be happy. I consider this an \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nimportant countervailing factor in favour of staying with Ms. Chang. Moving forward, \\nhowever, I find it is Mr. Huang who will best be able to care for Teddy and make decisions \\nfor him as he grows, but with important regular contact with his mother. \\n \\nExposure to adult sexual activity \\n[23] \\nMs. Chang testified that Teddy sleeps with her in her bed. She also testified that she is \\nengaged and intends to be married in two or three years. According to Ms. Chang, her \\nfiancé had only slept over twice while Teddy was there. The rest of the time he does not \\nsleep over unless Teddy is with Mr. Huang on the weekends.  \\n[24] \\nMr. Huang testified that he and his mother observed sexual behaviour in Teddy that were \\nof concern including touching her breasts and thrusting while on her lap. The CAS worker \\ninvestigating the incident testified. She stated that she discussed it with Ms. Chang and \\nconcluding that it was normal for a child to “wiggle around”. Nothing further was done. \\n[25] \\nI am not satisfied with this conclusion for the purpose of determining what is in Teddy’s \\nbest interest and where he should primarily reside. The CAS worker agreed that she did \\nnot ask probing questions about Ms. Chang’s fiancé, how often he sleeps over, or what \\nsexual activity, if any, Teddy might have experienced.  \\n[26] \\nI do not find Ms. Chang credible on this issue. I do not believe that her fiancé only sleeps \\nover on weekends when Teddy is not there. I find that it is more likely than not that \\nTeddy’s sleeping arrangement exposes him to adult sexual activity. Ms. Chang has no plan \\nto move Teddy out of her room and intends to continue to use the second bedroom as \\nher office. This is concerning. It is wonderful that Ms. Chang has a new life with a new life \\npartner.  The concern is that I heard little evidence on how Teddy will be accommodated \\nin that new life including his sleeping arrangement.  \\n[27] \\nPlacing Teddy with Mr. Huang will minimize this potential exposure. Teddy will have his \\nown bedroom either at his great-grandfather’s house or his grandmother’s house, and \\nultimately Mr. Huang’s house when he has his own place. Mr. Huang was on disability for \\nsome time but now has full-time employment. He hopes to be able to obtain a place for \\nhim and Teddy. Focusing on Teddy’s best interest, my concern pulls toward Teddy \\nprimarily residing with Mr. Huang. \\n[28] \\nFamily violence – verbal and emotional abuse \\n[29] \\nI have already described that neither the CAS nor the police have concerns about Mr. \\nHuang’s ability to care for Teddy. Nor have any family violence investigations come to \\nanything. However, this does not alleviate my obligation to consider the impact on Teddy \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nof negative attitudes his parents may have toward each other or conflict that he has \\nexperienced.  \\n[30] \\nHaving heard from the parties and read the WhatsApp and Our Family Wizard exchanges \\nbetween the two, Mr. Huang has no respect for Ms. Chang or her ability to parent Teddy. \\nI accept Ms. Chang’s evidence that she has been subject to Mr. Huang’s verbal and \\nemotional abuse. This is a form of family violence.  This is a significant factor in considering \\nwhether it is in Teddy’s best interest to be in Mr. Huang’s primary care. My concern is \\nthat Mr. Huang will diminish Ms. Chang’s worth in Teddy’s eyes and will alienate her. Such \\nconduct would have serious ramifications for Teddy. Mr. Huang must understand and \\naccept that the CAS has found nothing wrong with Ms. Chang’s ability to parent and has \\nno concern about Teddy being in her care. It is Mr. Huang who often involved the CAS. He \\nshould then be bound by their conclusions. \\n[31] \\nNotwithstanding my concern, I believe it remains in Teddy’s best interest to reside with \\nMr. Huang and for Mr. Huang to be his primary decision-maker, with generous and \\nfrequent parenting time with Ms. Chang to nurture their bond. This is because overall, \\nMr. Huang will provide Teddy with a stable, healthy environment as described above. This \\nenvironment outweighs the potential harm to Teddy of Mr. Huang alienating him from \\nhis mother. I hope the resolution of this case will re-focus Ms. Chang and Mr. Huang on \\nTeddy and will calm what have been very choppy waters.  \\n[32] \\nA condition of my decision to place Teddy with Mr. Huang is that Mr. Huang does not \\nspeak ill of Ms. Chang, and speaks to her respectfully when in Teddy’s presence, \\nregardless of whether Mr. Huang agrees or disagrees with what Ms. Chang is saying or \\ndoing. This includes leaving Ms. Chang to parent Teddy how she sees fit when Teddy is \\nwith her. If Mr. Huang is unable to do that, this would amount to a material change where \\nMs. Chang could seek a variation of my order. This is not to suggest that Mr. Huang must \\nbe superhuman. A few digressions are inevitable. On the other hand, a pattern of \\nbehaviour that alienates Teddy from Ms. Chang emotionally or otherwise is cause for this \\ncourt to re-visit my decision to place Teddy with Mr. Huang. If such intervention is \\nnecessary, Mr. Huang risks a significant  costs award against him and relocating Teddy \\nback with Ms. Chang. This would not be good for Teddy. \\n[33] \\nMs. Chang has a reciprocal responsibility to Teddy to do what she can to work \\ncooperatively with Mr. Huang, be on time with exchanges, and communicate through Our \\nFamily Wizard if something goes awry.  \\nOther factors – Ms. Chang’s mental health \\n[34] \\nMs. Chang testified that she was born in Canada but went to Costa Rica with her mother \\nand family when she was thirteen. Her mother then permitted her to be married at aged \\nfifteen. I have no evidence as to the age of her spouse. They are now divorced. Ms. Chang \\nand Mr. Huang met at Enercare in 2017, after Ms. Chang had returned to Canada amid \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\ndivorce proceedings. Ms. Chang states that CAMH diagnosed her with PTSD due to the \\ndivorce and the trial record shows that on at least one occasion she revealed suicidal \\nthoughts to Mr. Huang.  Ms. Chang testified that she is on ODSP while she receives \\ncounselling from the effects of the divorce, and that they are “giving her time” before \\nlooking for employment. Ms. Chang was prescribed medication to treat PTSD but stated \\non the stand that she was no longer taking it and is better.  \\n[35] \\nI am troubled by this testimony about Ms. Chang’s current health. It does not make sense \\nthat ODSP continues to fund Ms. Chang if she is better. This means that either she is \\ndefrauding ODSP or she is not better. Having observed Ms. Chang on the stand, it is more \\nlikely than not that Ms. Chang is not better. Ms. Chang’s demeanour on the stand was \\nunusual. She was monotone, emotionless, and often did not appreciate the gravity of the \\nquestion that was being asked. Of note is that Ms. Chang unilaterally chose to explain her \\ndemeanour. She attributes it to the head injury alleged to have been caused by Mr. \\nHuang. As noted earlier, there is no corroboration by anyone that Ms. Chang hit her head. \\nThere are no medical records nor any medical diagnosis of a head injury that would affect \\nMs. Chang’s manner.  \\n[36] \\nWe know that demeanour is a minor factor in assessing a witness. There is no one way a \\nperson testifies and usually a person’s demeanour sheds little light on credibility and \\nreliability. On the other hand, there is a logical inference that I draw when combining Ms. \\nChang’s demeanour on the stand with her evidence of her state of mind and continued \\nreliance on ODSP. The inference is that Ms. Chang is still dealing with mental health issues.  \\nAnd there is nothing wrong with that. People dealing with mental health are not \\ndisqualified from caring for their children. In this case however, my concern is Ms. Chang’s \\nlack of awareness of what is likely to be the reality of continuing mental health challenges \\nand/or her active attempt to minimize it.  \\n[37] \\nI am also concerned that Ms. Chang and Teddy will have no support to assist Ms. Chang \\nin caring for Teddy, should she have a particularly bad mental health day. Ms. Chang’s \\nmother and other family has returned to Costa Rica leaving only her father to help. There \\nwas no evidence that he could or would step in if needed. Ms. Chang testified about being \\nfriends with the mother of Teddy’s best friend, and she now has her fiancé. I note \\nhowever that even during the trial Ms. Chang reported that she and her fiancé broke up, \\nand then got back together. In other words, I am not sure how secure the relationship is \\nand whether he is truly a source of support for any mental health challenges Ms. Chang \\nmight face. These challenges will affect Teddy. This, on its own, does not warrant moving \\nhim. But, after considering all relevant factors already discussed and focusing on Teddy’s \\nbest interest, Mr. Huang should be the primary caregiver and sole decision-maker.  \\n[38] \\nI turn now to the issue of child support. \\nChild Support Arrears \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n[39] \\nMr. Huang candidly admits that he has not paid appropriate child support. Part of the \\nreason is that he was, for a time, on long term disability. The other reason I find Mr. Huang \\ndid not pay child support is because he mistrusted Ms. Chang’s use of the funds. Instead, \\nMr. Huang decided to pay it by providing diapers, and wipes and food. I have explained \\nto Mr. Huang that the payor cannot control how child support is paid. It is owed to the \\nchild via the custodial parent. \\n[40] \\n The Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175) were established to simplify child \\nsupport and is the appropriate beginning and end point for this family to determine how \\nmuch child support arrears Mr. Huang owes. The tables are based on the payor’s total \\nannual income. Teddy was born August 29, 2019. Mr. Huang’s income since 2019 is as \\nfollows: \\nYear \\nTotal income (line 15000) \\n2019 \\n$32,884 \\n2020 \\n$49,800 \\n2021 \\n$33,348 \\n2022 \\n$27,267 \\n2023 \\n$48,000 \\n \\n[41] \\nBased on the table amount, Mr. Huang owes arrears of: \\nYear \\nArrears owing \\n2019 \\n$282/month = $3,384 \\n2020 \\n$461/month = $5,532 \\n2021 \\n$282/month = $3,384 \\n2022 \\n$223/month = $2,676 \\n2023 \\n$445/month = $5,340 \\nTOTAL: \\n$20,316 \\n \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\n[42] \\nMr. Huang provided bank records showing child support payments from 2020 to 2023. \\nThose amounts equal approximately $3700 leaving outstanding arrears of $16,616.  \\nChild support moving forward \\n[43] \\nMr. Huang will now have primary care of Teddy and sole-decision-making. Ms. Chang will \\nhave parenting time from from Thursday, after school, to Sunday at 10 a.m. For table \\nsupport purposes, Ms. Chang earns $32,000 annually. This means that she owes Teddy \\n$273/month and $3,276 annually. Given the arrears, Ms. Chang is relieved from paying \\nchild support until June 1, 2029 based on the assumption that she will continue to earn \\n$32,000 annually.  \\n[44] \\nStarting  June 1, 2029, Ms. Chang shall pay table child support based on her income as \\nreported on her 2028 income tax return. which amount can be found if she googles \\n“Federal Child Support Guidelines” and then selects the table for Ontario. On June 1 of \\nevery year after June 1, 2029, Ms. Chang shall adjust her child support payment and pay \\nthe table amount for whatever total income is listed on her income tax return for the \\nprior year. If she cannot file a return, Ms. Chang must send Mr. Huang a sworn financial \\nstatement attesting to her income. She can send this to him by mail or if their relationship \\nimproves, at an exchange. \\nDisposition: \\n[45] \\nMr. Huang shall have sole decision-making and primary care of Teddy, with the caveat \\nthat Mr. Huang will give Ms. Chang the opportunity to provide input to major educational, \\nreligious and medical decisions. \\n[46] \\nThe parties shall continue to communicate about Teddy through Our Family Wizard until \\nsuch time as they can speak respectfully with each other.  \\n[47] \\nMs. Chang shall have weekly parenting time from Thursday, after school, to Sunday at 10 \\na.m., subject to any proposed changes by the parties which they are to provide to me in \\nthe form of a draft order, including their proposed arrangement for holidays and summer \\nbreak. They can send it to my assistant Jessica.Crispo@ontario.ca. If they cannot agree, \\nthe parties can each send their proposed schedule and I will decide on one.  \\n[48] \\nFor exchanges, Mr. Huang shall pick up Teddy from Ms. Chang on Sunday mornings at 10 \\na.m. in the lobby of her building. Ms. Chang can directly pick Teddy up from school on \\nThursdays. \\n[49] \\nThe parties shall work together to prepare Teddy for his new living arrangement. To that \\nend, Ms. Chang shall ensure that Teddy is able to take with him, any of his personal items \\nthat would assist him in the transition. \\n2024 ONSC 266 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\n[50] \\nEven though I give Mr. Huang primary care, it is in Teddy’s best interest that he continues \\nto have a strong bond with Ms. Chang. Mr. Huang shall foster their relationship, \\nregardless of his thoughts on her parenting abilities or about her as a person. It is critical \\nfor Teddy’s well being that both parents are respectful to each other, and about each \\nother, when talking to Teddy.  \\n[51] \\nMr. Huang shall not micro-manage Ms. Chang and shall leave her to parent Teddy how \\nshe sees fit when Teddy is with her. If Mr. Huang is unable to do that and shows a pattern \\nof controlling conduct that alienates Teddy from Ms. Chang, Ms. Chang can seek to vary \\nthis order.  \\n[52] \\nMr. Huang owes Ms. Chang child support arrears of $16,616 which shall be offset but \\nfuture child support owing from Ms. Chang. \\n[53] \\nMs. Chang shall commence child support payments on June 1, 2029, based on her total \\nincome reported for the 2028 taxation year. If she did not file an income tax return, her \\nincome for the purpose of calculating support will be based on a sworn financial \\nstatement of her income as at May 1, 2029, that she mails to Mr. Huang no later than \\nMay 1, 2029. This is the pattern to follow every year – Ms. Chang’s support will be based \\non her income as reported in her income tax return for the prior year or based on a sworn \\nfinancial statement indicating her income as at May 1st. \\nCosts: \\n[54] \\nThe successful party who has retained counsel is normally entitled to recover some of \\ntheir cost from the unsuccessful party. In this case, Mr. Huang was self-represented. He \\nis entitled to claim some cost for time spent on work that would otherwise have been \\ndone by a lawyer. Mr. Huang does not have to claim costs. It is up to him.  \\n[55] \\nIf Mr. Huang claims such costs, he needs to itemize his time and hourly rate that he is \\nclaiming from Ms. Chang. Mr. Huang shall provide this information to Mr. Snider, file it \\nwith the family office within two weeks of today and send it to Ms. Crispo. Mr. Snider can \\nrespond with submissions of no longer than three pages double-spaced, within two weeks \\nafter receiving Mr. Huang’s proposed costs. \\n[56] \\nIf Ms. Chang feels that she should recover some of her costs from Mr. Huang, she can \\ninclude that in her responding submissions, in which case Mr. Snider should include a Bill \\nof Costs.  \\n \\n \\n \\nJustice P.T.

JARVIS, J: \\n \\n[1] \\nThis voir dire ruling involves a witness whom Mr. Ierullo proposes to call and to whom Ms. \\nAdragone objects being allowed to testify. Gabrielle St. George (Ms. St. George) is Ms. \\nAdragone’s estranged sister. In accordance with court directions, Ms. St. George has provided an \\naffidavit sworn on March 6, 2024, during a mid-trial break, setting out her proposed evidence. \\n \\n[2] \\nMr. Ierullo claims that Ms. St. George’s evidence is admissible and can be grouped broadly into \\nthree categories: a Loan Assignment (the “Loan Assignment”) involving an aggregate $500,000 \\nloan to her by her sister and Mr. Ierullo, and its later assignment to Ms. Adragone in 2011; the \\ntransfer of Ms. Adragone’s family home (“Taylor Mills”) in which her late mother resided until \\nearly 2021 to Ms. Adragone’s son and his sale of it later in 2021; and, forgery and fraudulent \\ndocuments allegations to support unproven, exaggerated or fake debts claimed by Ms. Adragone. \\nMr. Ierullo claims that Ms. St. George’s evidence is relevant to the property issues in the \\nmatrimonial and civil litigation between the parties and should also be admitted as similar fact \\nevidence. Ms. Adragone submits that her sister’s evidence is actuated by ill-will toward her, that \\nshe has no direct knowledge of many of the events described (particularly involving Taylor Mills) \\nand that her proposed evidence is almost entirely hearsay because they comprise discussions \\nbetween Ms. St. George and her mother (Olive George, now deceased) and a lawyer (Mr. \\nCatalano, also deceased) who represented her in her own matrimonial proceedings over a decade \\nago (2011) and which allegations, implicitly if not directly, involve one of Ms. Adragone’s trial \\nlawyers (Casey). \\n \\n[3] \\nMr. Ierullo identified the paragraphs in Ms. St. George’s affidavit which he submits are relevant \\nor comprise similar facts. \\n \\nLoan Assignment \\n \\n[4] \\nThe unchallenged evidence in this case is that Ms. Adragone and Mr. Ierullo advanced $500,000 \\nin three tranches between July 28 to December 8, 2003, to Ms. St. George and her former spouse. \\nMs. St. George and her former spouse signed a document for $140,000 acknowledging their \\nindebtedness to Ms. Adragone and Mr. Ierullo (the first tranche was for $140,000) but it was only \\n2024 CanLII 27330 (ON SC)\\n3 \\n \\n \\ncountersigned by Ms. Adragone, not by Mr. Ierullo. One of the terms of the document provided \\nthat “Should any further money be loaned…the terms of this agreement will stand.” Further \\nadvances were made on August 14, 2003 ($10,000) and December 8, 2003 ($140,000). Ms. St. \\nGeorge clearly identified all three advances as loans. \\n \\n[5] \\nIn 2009 just before Ms. St. George was scheduled to meet with Mr. Catalano in her family law \\ncase she and Ms. Adragone added to the bottom of the 2003 loan document “Additional $360,000 \\nto bring investment to $500,000, all terms shall stand.” These added words are undated. Ms. St. \\nGeorge described this document in bold letters as the 2009 Fake Loan Amendment. In a Net \\nFamily Property Statement prepared by Mr. Catalano the $500,000 loan is noted: Ms. St. George \\nproposed that she assume the full debt. Exhibits to Ms. St. George’s affidavit contain emails \\nbetween Ms. St. George, Mr. Catalano and Ms. Casey about trial strategy. \\n \\n[6] \\nThere is no evidence independent of Ms. St. George what impact if any the loan had in the \\nproceedings between her and her spouse (he claimed that the $360,000 was a gift) although it \\nappears that Ms. St. George benefitted from her litigation strategy. \\n \\n[7] \\nBy letter dated January 24, 2011, Ms. Casey advised Ms. St. George and her spouse that Mr. \\nIerullo had assigned his interest with respect to the $500,000 loan to Ms. Adragone. Mr. Ierullo \\nhas already testified that he does not recognize the signature as his. \\n \\nTaylor Mills \\n \\n[8] \\nOlive George resided in the Taylor Mills residence until she was moved to a retirement home in \\nJanuary 2021. In early April 2021 she was diagnosed with Alzheimers but had been \\ndemonstrating signs of dementia before that date. She died in March 2023.  \\n \\n[9] \\nMs. St. George alleges that the transfer of Taylor Mills to Ms. Adragone’s son was orchestrated \\nby Ms. Adragone and that based on discussions with her mother over an unspecified period of \\nyears Ms. Adragone exerted “undue influence and/or duress” on their mother.1 Ms. St. George \\nwas never involved with any of the transactions involving Taylor Mills. Based on her “beliefs” \\nabout her sister Ms. St. George states that Ms. Adragone fraudulently obtained ownership of \\n                                                 \\n1 Title to the property was transferred into the joint names of Ms. George and Ms. Adragone’s son in 2016. \\n2024 CanLII 27330 (ON SC)\\n4 \\n \\n \\nTaylor Mills and that it should be transferred back to their mother’s estate. There is no evidence \\nthat Ms. St. George ever consulted a lawyer about this or, if she did, whether any action was \\ntaken whether by her late mother or by Ms. St. George at any time, although she intimated to Ms. \\nCasey in 2015 that was her intention. \\n \\n[10] \\nMs. St. George indicated that the relationship between her sister and her ended in June 2011. \\n \\n[11] \\nMr. Ierullo points to paragraphs 29 to 43 of Ms. St. George’s affidavit as being relevant to the \\nissues in this case. Almost without exception, all those paragraphs are hearsay. \\n \\nForgery/fraudulent documents \\n \\n[12] \\nMr. Ierullo alleges that Ms. Adragone forged signatures or has engaged in presenting falsified or \\nfraudulent documents to favourably impact her net family property exposure in these proceedings \\nand that Ms. St. George’s evidence is relevant and should be admitted on a similar fact basis. \\n \\n[13] \\nFor “relevance”, Mr. Ierullo points to paragraphs 15-17 and 27-28 of Ms. St. George’s affidavit. \\nThe former deal with the Loan Agreement and the latter with negotiations between Ms. St. \\nGeorge and Ms. Casey (then acting for Ms. Adragone) with respect to money’s advanced over the \\nyears to Ms. St. George with whose repayment she agreed but which she now contends the actual \\namount owed was inflated. The emails appended to her affidavit are inconsistent with her \\naffidavit evidence. There is no evidence that Ms. St. George moved to challenge her sister’s \\nclaims after she agreed to settle them. \\n  \\n[14] \\nMr. Ierullo points to paragraphs 10 and 11 of Ms. St. George’s affidavit as comprising similar \\nfact evidence. These paragraphs contain statements about what Olive George told her and her \\n“belief” that Ms. Adragone forged her mother’s signature on a “fake assignment”.  Ms. St. \\nGeorge is not qualified to express an opinion about handwriting. The signatures on the two \\ndocuments referenced in her affidavit are dissimilar. Ms. St. George’s evidence is not required \\nconfirm that. Paragraphs 18 to 26 deal with Ms. St. George’s trial strategies in her family law \\nlitigation. In my view, the excerpted references are selective and in no way can be considered \\nwithout appropriate context, namely, the entirety of Ms. St. George’s family law litigation \\nstrategies and their outcome.  \\n \\n2024 CanLII 27330 (ON SC)\\n5 \\n \\n \\nDiscussion \\n \\n[15] \\nWhen the issue of Ms. St. George’s testimony was raised shortly after the trial in these \\nproceedings began this court expressed concern about this case devolving into an examination of \\nthe family law litigation between Ms. St. George and her former spouse and estate issues \\ninvolving the late Olive George. In so many respects Mr. Ierullo’s proposal to call Ms. St. George \\nis predicated on a theory of relevance based on hearsay, wrapped in conjecture and delivered with \\nclear animus. And in so many respects proposing this witness is not too different from serial \\nefforts by Mr. Ierullo to amend his pleadings to add causes of action or refine his claims in the \\nfamily law component of these proceedings or, in the case of his recently added civil claim, to \\nremedy what Mr. Nguyen described were pleadings “cobbled together with imperfect \\ninformation.” The family case started in 2017 and the civil action shortly before the family case \\nwas scheduled to proceed to trial. The principal reason why the family and civil matters are being \\nheard together is because so many of the issues and the persons involved are the same. \\n \\n[16] \\nIn the second of several Case Management Rulings in these proceedings I alluded to litigants not \\nhaving unlimited access to trial judges.2  My words then warrant repetition. \\n \\n [4] In Greco-Wang v. Wang, 2014 ONSC 5366 (a Trial Management Conference \\nruling) Kiteley J. observed that “members of the public who are users of the civil \\ncourts are not entitled to unlimited access to trial judges. The duration of the trial \\nmust be proportionate to the issues at stake and the judicial resources available”. \\nThis court has already scheduled at least 14 days of trial (the estimate is 19 days \\nsuch that, if not concluded by the end of September, the balance of the trial will \\nneed to be adjourned to the November 2023 trial sittings). The parties may have \\nunlimited funds to litigate but this court does not have unlimited resources (already \\nmuch of the proposed evidence is being presented by affidavit and the filing of \\nexpert reports).  \\n \\n \\n[17] \\nThe trial is scheduled to continue on April 2, 2024. Expanding the scope of this case to \\nselectively include (and that is what would be involved) an examination of Ms. St. George’s \\nfamily law litigation and her complaints about her sister’s treatment of her and their mother and \\nthe mother’s estate are not this case. The court would be obliged to dive down a rabbit hole of \\nMs. St. George’s family case and her complaints of ill-treatment by Ms. Adragone about her and \\nher mother and would inevitably draw Ms. Casey into the fray. Considerable trial latitude and \\n                                                 \\n2 2023 ONSC 3675. \\n2024 CanLII 27330 (ON SC)\\n6 \\n \\n \\njudicial resources have already been given to the parties. There is nothing in Ms. St. George’s \\nproposed evidence that adds to the fair determination of the family and civil issues in this case. \\n \\n[18] \\nMs. St. George will not be permitted to testify.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n______________________________ \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Honourable Justice D.A.

Tanguay et al. 2018  \\nONSC 1875  \\nCOURT FILE NO.: FC-18-473-0001 \\nDATE: March 28, 2024 \\nSUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE - ONTARIO \\nRE: \\nJS, Applicant \\nAND: \\nNH and The Children’s Aid Society of the Niagara Region, Respondents \\nBEFORE: \\nMacNeil J. \\nCOUNSEL: M. Zalev and K. Warren – Agents for the Applicant \\n \\nJ. Farrer – for the Respondent, The Children’s Aid Society of the Niagara Region \\n \\nV. Workman – for the Office of the Children’s Lawyer \\nHEARD: \\nJanuary 11, 2024 (via Zoom videoconference) \\n \\nREASONS FOR DECISION \\n \\nINTRODUCTION \\n \\n[1] \\nThe Applicant makes this motion seeking an order extending the deadline to apply to the \\ncourt for an openness order under s. 196(1) of the Child, Youth and Family Services Act, 2017, \\nS.O. 2017, c. 14, Sched. 1 (“the CYFSA” or “the Act”), pursuant to the court’s parens patriae \\njurisdiction. \\n \\n[2] \\nThe Children’s Aid Society of the Niagara Region (“the Society”) consents to the relief \\nrequested.  \\n \\nWARNING \\nIdentifying information contained herein is prohibited from publication pursuant to \\nsection 87(8) of the Child, Youth and Family Services Act, 2017. \\n \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 2 of 12 \\n \\n[3] \\nThe Office of the Children’s Lawyer (“the OCL”) does not oppose the court exercising its \\nparens patriae jurisdiction in the particular circumstances of this case, given that the child wants \\nongoing contact with the Applicant and would not be prejudiced by the requested order. However, \\nthe OCL submits that the court must first be satisfied that the facts of the case support the use of \\nparens patriae and that the applicable legal test is met. \\nBACKGROUND \\n[4] \\nPursuant to the Final Order of The Honourable Justice J.R. Henderson, dated April 20, \\n2021, the child’s mother and father were deemed to be access holders to the child and the child \\nwas deemed to be an access holder to each of his parents. \\n \\n[5] \\nOn August 18, 2023, the Applicant was served with notice of the Society’s intention to \\nplace the child for adoption and that the access order would terminate upon such placement.  \\n \\n[6] \\nAs access holders, the child and the Applicant were both advised that they had the right to \\nmake an openness application within 30 days, the time limit set out in the CYFSA. \\n \\n[7] \\nThe Applicant worked with her lawyer to deliver her openness application within the 30-\\nday time limit. She signed the application on September 15, 2023, and it was served on the Society \\non September 18, 2023. Unfortunately, the application was not issued by the court before it was \\nserved.  \\n \\n[8] \\nThe Applicant’s openness application was issued on October 10, 2023, which is outside \\nthe statutory time limit. The issued application was served on the Society and others on October \\n29, 2023. \\n \\n[9] \\nThe child filed his own openness application seeking continued contact with the Applicant \\nwithin the prescribed time. Further, the Applicant has brought a status review application \\nrequesting that the child be returned to her care. \\n \\nThe Motion \\n \\n[10] \\nBy this motion, the Applicant asks the court to extend the time for her to apply for an \\nopenness order to October 29, 2023, the date the issued application was served. The Applicant \\nsubmits that this court can and should exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to extend the time \\nfor an access holder to apply for an openness order under s. 196(1) of the CYFSA in appropriate \\ncircumstances to: (i) fill an unintentional gap in the legislation; and (ii) achieve the paramount \\nobjective of the Act. The Applicant contends that it would not be in the child’s best interests to \\nprevent the Applicant from being able to apply for an openness order and thereby deprive the court \\nof the important evidence and submissions that she can offer the court to help it fulfil the CYFSA’s \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 3 of 12 \\n \\nparamount purpose of promoting the child’s “best interests, protection and well-being”, solely \\nbecause of a minor and inadvertent procedural irregularity. \\nISSUES \\n[11] \\nThe issues to be determined on this motion are:  \\n \\n(a) \\nShould the court exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to extend the time for the \\nApplicant to bring an openness application because there is an unintentional gap in \\nthe legislation? \\n \\n(b) \\nShould the court exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to extend the time for the \\nApplicant to bring an openness application because it is necessary to achieve the \\nparamount objective of the CYFSA? \\n \\nTHE LAW \\n \\nThe Legislation \\n \\n[12] \\nSection 1(1) of the CYFSA provides that “[t]he paramount purpose of this Act is to promote \\nthe best interests, protection and well-being of children.” \\n \\n[13] \\nPursuant to s. 191(1) of the CYFSA, when a child is placed for adoption, every order \\nrespecting access to the child is terminated. \\n \\n[14] \\nAfter a child is placed for adoption, they may maintain some degree of contact with their \\nbirth families and/or other individuals with whom they had significant relationships prior to the \\nadoption by way of an openness order or agreement. Section 196 of the Act provides for the process \\nfor applying for an openness order where an access order is in effect.  \\n \\n[15] \\nPursuant to s. 196(1), an access holder may, within 30 days after receiving notice of a \\nsociety’s intention to place the child for adoption, apply to the court for an openness order. Section \\n196(2) requires that a person making an openness application is required to give notice of the \\napplication to the society, the child, and/or the person who will be permitted to communicate with \\nor have a relationship with the child if the order is made. \\n \\n[16] \\nSection 196(4) provides that a society is not to place the child for adoption before the 30-\\nday time period under s. 196(1) has expired, unless every person who is entitled to do so has \\nalready made an application for an openness order. Sections 196(5) and (6) require a society to \\ninform the potential adoptive parents of any openness application that has been made, the requested \\nrelief, and the outcome of the application.  \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 4 of 12 \\n \\n \\n[17] \\nSection 196(7) of the Act provides that the court may make an openness order if it is \\nsatisfied that, \\n(a) \\nthe openness order is in the best interests of the child; \\n \\n(b) \\nthe openness order will permit the continuation of a relationship with a person \\nthat is beneficial and meaningful to the child; and \\n \\n(c) \\nthe child has consented to the order, if they are 12 or older. \\n \\n[18] \\nThere is no provision to be found in the CYFSA that grants the court authority to extend \\nthe statutory 30-day timeline set out in s 196(1) of the Act. This is acknowledged by the parties.  \\n \\nParens patriae jurisdiction \\n \\n[19] \\n  Parens patriae is the power of the court to act in the stead of a parent for the protection \\nof a child: A.C.B. v. R.B., 2010 ONCA 714, at para. 23. The power of parens patriae does not \\nconfer supplemental jurisdiction to rewrite legislation or procedure: S.D.G. v. A.S., 2015 ONSC \\n752, at para. 55. \\n \\n[20] \\nThe court in Johnson v. Athimootil, [2007] O.J. No. 3788 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 29, \\nsummarized the parens patriae jurisdiction as follows: \\n \\nThe parens patriae jurisdiction originates from the Court of Chancery’s wardship \\nover, initially, mentally incompetent individuals and later also children: E. (Mrs.) v. \\nEve, 1986 CanLII 36 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 388 at 407-12. Generally, the power is \\nreserved for cases in which there is legislative gap and is not exercised to modify \\nexisting statutory schemes: see Beson v. Newfoundland (Director of Child Welfare), \\n1982 CanLII 32 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 716. However, in the unanimous judgment \\nof the Supreme Court of Canada in E. (Mrs.) v. Eve, supra, LaForest J. wrote as a \\nclarification to the general rule at 411, “It continues to this day, and even where there \\nis legislation in the area, the courts will continue to use the parens patriae jurisdiction \\nto deal with uncontemplated situations where it appears necessary to do so for the \\nprotection of those who fall within its ambit.” \\n \\n[21] \\nIn E. (Mrs.) v. Eve, 1986 CanLII 36 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 388, at para. 73, LaForest J., \\nfor the Supreme Court, explained that the parens patriae jurisdiction is “founded on necessity, \\nnamely the need to act for the protection of those who cannot care for themselves” and “it is to be \\nexercised in the ‘best interest’ of the protected person, or again, for his or her ‘benefit’ or \\n‘welfare’”. LaForest J. further held, at para. 77:  \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 5 of 12 \\n \\n \\nThe discretion is to be exercised for the benefit of that person, not for that of others. \\nIt is a discretion, too, that must at all times be exercised with great caution, a caution \\nthat must be redoubled as the seriousness of the matter increases. This is particularly \\nso in cases where a Court might be tempted to act because failure to do so would risk \\nimposing an obviously heavy burden on some other individual. \\n \\n[22] \\nA review of the jurisprudence shows that the parens patriae jurisdiction can be exercised \\nin the following circumstances: \\n \\n(a) \\nwhere there is an unintentional legislative gap; \\n(b) \\nwhere a child is in danger; \\n(c) \\nin a judicial review of the exercise of statutory power by an administrative authority; \\nand \\n(d) \\nwhere it is necessary to achieve the paramount objective of the applicable legislation. \\n \\nSee K.F. v. Children’s Aid Society of Ottawa, 2018 ONSC 364, at para. 11; L.F. v. Children’s Aid \\nSociety of Ottawa, 2022 ONSC 3682, at para. 16; and A.A. v. B.B., 2007 ONCA 2, at paras. 27 and \\n40. \\n \\n[23] \\nAssessing whether parens patriae should be exercised is a “very fact specific exercise”: \\nA.C.B. v. R.B., 2010 ONCA 714, at para. 30. \\n \\nANALYSIS \\n \\n(a) \\nShould the court exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to extend the time for the \\nApplicant to bring an openness application because there is an unintentional gap \\nin the legislation? \\n \\nPosition of the Applicant \\n \\n[24] \\nThe Applicant argues that there is an “unintentional gap” in the Act because there is no \\nprovision that addresses whether the deadline to apply for an openness order can be extended, \\neither on consent or by court order. She submits that the court must consider whether the Act was \\nintended to be a complete code and, in particular, whether it was intended to preclude the court \\nfrom ever extending the 30-day deadline to apply for an openness order, no matter what the \\nsituation. \\n \\n[25] \\nIt is the Applicant’s position that, upon considering the stated purposes of the Act, it is \\nclear that the Legislature’s intention is to facilitate a relationship between a child and their \\nbiological parents, to the extent that the relationship is in the child’s best interests. Given the \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 6 of 12 \\n \\nspecific wording of s. 196(1), the conclusion should be reached that the CYFSA was not intended \\nto preclude the court from extending the deadline for commencing an openness application in \\nappropriate circumstances. To interpret the Act in a way that restricts the court’s inherent powers \\nin this regard would thwart the clear legislative intent.  \\n \\nDiscussion \\n \\n[26] \\nThe Applicant argues that the legislation does not provide for the factual situation before \\nme – where a party intended to apply for an openness order within the 30-day time period but \\nfailed to have the application issued by the court within that time period. While this is an unusual \\nand sympathetic fact situation, there is no gap in the legislation requiring this court to intervene. \\nThe Legislature used clear language in providing for the 30-day time limit. The Legislature was \\nalso clear in not enacting a provision permitting the extension of that time limit.  \\n \\n[27] \\nIn K.F. v. Children’s Aid Society of Ottawa, 2018 ONSC 364, the court was determining \\nwhether it had jurisdiction to extend the 30-day statutory period set out in s. 145.1.2 of the Child \\nand Family Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (“the CFSA”), what is now s. 196 of the CYFSA, \\nin order to allow the maternal grandparents of two children who were placed for adoption, to bring \\ntheir own application for an openness order. The children’s mother had served her openness \\napplication and the grandparents had filed a response to it, in which they sought their own openness \\norder. At para. 12, Audet J. held that she “would not rule out the possibility that a court might use \\nits inherent parens patriae jurisdiction to extend the statutory timelines set out in s. 145.1.2 … in \\nappropriate circumstances”. However, she held that she would not do so in the case before her \\n“given the protracted litigation and numerous appeals that have precluded these children from \\nachieving permanency, and in circumstances where the adoptive parents have clearly confirmed \\ntheir willingness to voluntarily enter into an openness agreement with the grandparents”. \\n \\n[28] \\nIn K.F., at para. 9, Audet J. also commented: \\n \\nIt is unclear whether a legislative gap argument would be successful in Ontario, \\ngiven our legislative scheme for openness orders. However, in compelling fact \\nsituations, courts can be willing to look at a variety of options to secure ongoing \\ncontact with important members of the child’s community … \\n \\n[29] \\nI find that the CYFSA provides a complete legislative framework as it relates to openness \\norders. The Act contemplates an openness application being brought within 30 days. The purpose \\nof the legislation is to promote the welfare of the child. It is reasonable there should be a deadline \\nas set out in s. 196(1) by which an access holder must act, as setting such timelines is likely to \\nbenefit the welfare of the child. The deadline can be reasonably met, as is indicated by the fact that \\nthe child was able to apply within the 30-day time limit. The fact that there is no provision for \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 7 of 12 \\n \\nextending that time limit does not mean there is a legislative gap. It means that the access holder \\nmust do what needs to be done within the time prescribed. The Applicant, as an access holder, was \\ncapable of meeting the 30-day time limit if the necessary steps had been taken. It was only due to \\ninadvertence that the deadline was not met.  \\n \\n[30] \\nIn U.(J.) v. Alberta (Regional Director of Child Welfare), 2001 ABCA 125 (Alta C.A.), \\nthe applicant failed to file a copy of the notice of appeal in the Provincial Court, as was required \\nunder the Child Welfare Act, SA 1984, c C-8.1. The applicant asked the court to exercise its parens \\npatriae jurisdiction to allow the appeal to proceed despite this non-compliance with the filing \\nrequirement. The Alberta Court of Appeal held that it does not have the jurisdiction to waive a \\nsubstantive requirement like a statutory limitation period or a statutory filing requirement: at para \\n6. The Court of Appeal also held that the failure of the legislature to enact a provision to waive the \\nstatutory filing requirement “does not amount to a gap in the legislation” permitting the court to \\nact, stating, at para. 7: \\n \\n… It cannot reasonably be argued that the legislature has overlooked the need to \\nprovide a provision to waive that which it expressly mandates. If it was intended that \\nsuch requirements could be overridden, the mandatory aspect of the legislation would \\nbe superfluous. So the court should not presume that the absence of such a provision \\nis the result of oversight. \\n \\n[31] \\nI agree with and adopt the Alberta Court of Appeal’s approach on the parens patriae issue, \\nas set out in U.(J.), in the case before me. \\n \\n[32] \\nThe 30-day time limit set out in s. 196(1) reflects a decision by the Legislature to the effect \\nthat, when a Notice of Intention to Place for Adoption is served, any application for an openness \\norder sought by an access holder must be made promptly because the rights and responsibilities of \\nother persons and the Society can be affected by the application. Those persons/entities, including \\nthe child who is to be placed for adoption, cannot be left in a state of uncertainty indefinitely. There \\nmust be closure and finality, so that individuals can move on and the child can have stability. \\n \\n[33] \\nThe Applicant further argues that a different section of the Act, s. 194, does not impose a \\n30-day limit on a society from applying for an openness order where there is no access order in \\nplace, and so this results in unequal treatment under the Act as it relates to access holders. I am not \\npersuaded by this argument. Rather, I am satisfied that the differentiation in the processes under s. \\n194 and s. 196 makes sense. In a s. 194 situation, where there is no access order in effect, there are \\nno access holders who can act for themselves and apply for an openness order. Setting a 30-day \\nlimit for an application to be made by a society in such circumstances could unduly foreclose \\npotential openness orders for relationships that may come to light before an adoption order is made. \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 8 of 12 \\n \\nThis would not be in the best interests of the child. In my view, there is nothing unfair about there \\nbeing no 30-day time limit set out in s. 194.  \\n \\n[34] \\nThe s. 194 process also differs from the procedure set out in s. 196 in that consent is needed. \\nThat is, by s. 194(4), the court may make an openness order under that section if it is satisfied that, \\n \\n(a) \\nthe openness order is in the best interests of the child; \\n \\n(b) \\nthe openness order will permit the continuation of a relationship with a person that is \\nbeneficial and meaningful to the child; and \\n \\n(c) \\nthe following entities and persons have consented to the order: \\n \\n(i) \\nthe society, \\n \\n(ii) \\nthe person who will be permitted to communicate with or have a relationship \\nwith the child if the order is made, \\n \\n(iii) the person with whom the society has placed or plans to place the child for \\nadoption, and \\n \\n(iv) the child if they are 12 or older. \\n \\nBecause of this, in my view, there is no need for a 30-day time limit to apply for an openness order \\nsince everyone who would be affected will have consented and the adoption process will not be \\ndelayed.  \\n \\n[35] \\nFinally, it is noted that a society is bound by a 30-day limitation under s. 197 of the Act. \\nThat section provides that, where a society intends to place for adoption a First Nations, Inuk or \\nMétis child who is in extended society care, the society has 30 days after notice is given to apply \\nto the court for an openness order, as are the other persons served with the notice of intention to \\nplace the child for adoption.  \\n \\n[36] \\nI conclude that there is no unintentional gap in the legislation requiring the court to exercise \\nits parens patriae jurisdiction on behalf of the child respecting the issues raised. By s. 196, the \\nchild, as an access holder, had the same entitlement to apply for an openness order as the Applicant. \\nIn the record before me, there is no evidence that the child’s openness application will not afford \\nthe necessary and appropriate protection for the child, especially given that the child is seeking \\nopenness with the Applicant and so she will have the ability to respond and participate. \\n \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 9 of 12 \\n \\n[37] \\nGiven my finding that there is no unintentional gap in the legislation, there is no ability for \\nthe court to exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to extend the time for the Applicant to bring an \\nopenness application on that ground. \\n(b) \\nShould the court exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to extend the time for the \\nApplicant to bring an openness application because it is necessary to achieve the \\nparamount objective of the CYFSA? \\n \\nPosition of the Applicant  \\n \\n[38] \\nThe Applicant submits that, if the court does not agree that there is a gap in the legislation, \\nit may still exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to achieve the paramount objective of the \\nCYFSA to “promote the best interests, protection and well-being of children”. The Applicant \\nsubmits that the court should extend the time for her to apply for an openness order for the \\nfollowing reasons: \\n \\n(a) \\nto ensure that all necessary parties, including the Applicant, can put forward fulsome \\nevidence and submissions to help the court determine what arrangements would be \\nin the child’s best interests, and how best to continue the relationship between the \\nApplicant and the child; \\n \\n(b) \\nto ensure that the Applicant’s “strong case for an openness order” can be heard on its \\nmerits; \\n \\n(c) \\nto ensure that all parties receive procedural fairness and avoid the appearance that the \\noutcome might have been different because of a minor procedural mistake; and, \\n \\n(d) \\nto ensure that the identified purposes of the Act are met. \\n \\n[39] \\nThe Applicant submits that K.F. is distinguishable since there has not been the same \\n“protracted litigation” that has impacted the child’s stability and permanency. The Applicant \\nserved her “unissued” openness application within the 30-day time limit, she has already served \\nthe issued application, and the brief extension requested will not delay the matter or prevent it from \\nmoving forward expeditiously. \\n \\n[40] \\nThe Applicant submits that having the opportunity to make her own application will allow \\nher to make submissions in a more comprehensive manner than if she is merely answering the \\nchild’s application. If the Applicant is only able to participate in the proceedings as a “respondent” \\nto the child’s openness application, there is a serious question in law as to whether she would be \\nable to seek a different openness order by way of her answer than what the OCL has requested. \\nFurther, if the child’s application is withdrawn for any reason, then the Applicant is left with no \\nability to pursue an openness order.  \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 10 of 12 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 11 of 12 \\n \\nDiscussion \\n \\n[41] \\nI am not satisfied that the exercise of parens patriae is necessary in order to achieve the \\nparamount purpose of the CYFSA, that is, to promote the best interests, protection and well-being \\nof the child.  \\n \\n[42] \\nWhile one may have considerable sympathy for the Applicant and her situation, there is no \\nevidence before me that it is necessary for this court to act for the protection of this child. As the \\ncourt stated in Eve, I must consider if the child needs protection and ensure that “[t]he discretion \\nis to be exercised for the benefit of that person, not for that of others.” In this situation, the rights \\nof the child are protected. The child is an access holder and therefore was notified of his entitlement \\nto apply for an openness order under s. 196(1). The child has legal representation through the OCL. \\nThe child has, in fact, applied for an order seeking openness to the Applicant. If that order is \\ngranted, it will support ongoing contact between the Applicant and the child. The Applicant is a \\nparty to the child’s openness application and, therefore, is entitled to file an answer to the \\napplication. I do not see that there are any further rights of the child’s that need protecting through \\nthe actions of the court. \\n \\n[43] \\nThe Applicant argues that in K.F., the court commented that each person seeking an \\nopenness order must bring their own application. I find K.F. to be distinguishable. In that case, it \\nwas the parents who made the openness application to which the grandparents were responding, \\nnot the child. Here, it is the child who has made the application seeking a continued relationship \\nwith the Applicant, to which the Applicant will be responding and so there is a direct connection \\nand/or relationship between the two that must necessarily be examined and considered by the court. \\nThe child’s rights and best interests will be considered in the specific context of having an openness \\norder as it relates to continued contact with the Applicant. This case is unlike the situation in K.F. \\nwhere the grandparents’ relationship with the children was not necessarily put in issue by the fact \\nof the parents’ openness application. \\n \\n[44] \\nBased on my finding that there is no anticipated risk of injury to the child here, it is not \\nnecessary for this court to exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to extend the time for the \\nApplicant to bring an openness application in order to achieve the paramount objective of the \\nCYFSA.  \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n[45] \\nThe resort to a parens patriae jurisdiction should be infrequent and it should be limited to \\ncases of necessity. I do not consider it necessary that the court protect the interests of the child in \\nthe case before me by making an order for the relief requested by the Applicant.  \\n \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n \\nPage 12 of 12 \\n \\n[46] \\nIn the result, the application for the court to exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction is \\ndismissed. \\n \\n[47] \\nCosts were not requested by any of the parties. No costs are awarded. \\n \\n \\nB. MacNeil J. \\n__________________________ \\nMacNEIL J. \\nReleased: \\nMarch 28, 2024 \\n2024 CanLII 27335 (ON SC)\\n',\n",

Costs are ordered in \\nfavour of the father, A.L., in the amount of $4,733.34, on a substantial indemnity \\nscale.  Although the father sought full recovery of costs in the sum of $5,916.68, \\nmy view is that costs on a substantial indemnity scale are more appropriate, and \\nI think that the amount ordered herein is a fair, just, reasonable, and proportionate \\nquantum of costs in the circumstances of this case. \\n[3] \\nRespectfully, the appeal is not a meritorious one.  It should not have been \\nbrought.    \\n2024 ONSC 1867 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 2 of 4 \\n \\n[4] \\nThe Decision of the Arbitrator was made on the basis of an executed \\n“Amending Separation Agreement”, or “ASA”, dated September 6, 2023.  At \\nclause 2 of the ASA, the parties amended the parenting arrangements for their \\ntwo children as set out in section 4 of their “Separation Agreement” dated March \\n6, 2017. \\n[5] \\nIn other words, the parties consented, in writing, to the 2-2-5-5 shared \\nparenting schedule, and the Decision merely enforced that agreement in the form \\nof an arbitral award. \\n[6] \\nWhat this is really about is the mother’s desire to resile from the ASA.  She \\nhas every right to pursue that goal of resilement, although it would only prolong \\nthe litigation, but the process for that is not what she tried to do before the \\nArbitrator [to effectively set aside the ASA by way of a 14B motion, as the \\nArbitrator eluded to at subparagraph 16(h)(ii) of his Decision] and equally not \\nwhat she tried to do before this Court (to make a collateral attack on the ASA by \\nlaunching an appeal of the Decision). \\n[7] \\nIt is not the job of this Court to give the mother legal advice.  She is a bright, \\narticulate lady, as evidenced by her presentation in the courtroom today.  She \\nhas been cautioned many times in the past about proceeding without legal \\nadvice; see, for example, footnote 6 of the Decision. She is self-represented, \\nhowever, so I will say this, which was already said to the mother during the brief \\nhearing of the within appeal – there is no motion to change any agreement or final \\norder that is before this Court.   \\n[8] \\nThe same arguments that the mother made to this Court on the appeal were \\nput to the Arbitrator before the Decision was made. Those same arguments, \\nincluding (i) alleged duress on the part of the mother, and (ii) an alleged absence \\nof a true agreement between the parties to alter the parenting schedule, and (iii) \\n2024 ONSC 1867 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 3 of 4 \\n \\nthe father’s alleged lack of follow-through with anticipated parenting coordination \\nand/or counselling, as three examples, were all considered and rejected by the \\nArbitrator.  The mother should refer to, in particular, paragraph 16 of the Decision. \\n[9] \\nIt is not the role of this Court to effectively retry the matter that was heard by \\nthe Arbitrator. The Decision is entitled to significant deference. Petersoo v. \\nPetersoo, 2019 ONCA 624, at paragraph 35, Patton-Casse v. Casse, 2012 \\nONCA 709, at paragraphs 9-11, N.M.A. v. J.B.A., 2024 ONSC 1346, at paragraph \\n21. \\n[10] The mother has identified no error made by the Arbitrator except to allege, \\nby implication, at paragraph 2 of her Notice of Appeal dated January 9, 2024, that \\nthe Decision failed to consider the best interests of the children. The mother \\nbrings the appeal under the authority of section 14 of the parties’ “Mediation-\\nArbitration Agreement” dated December 19, 2022, which provides for a right of \\nappeal on a question of law. \\n[11] A failure to consider the best interests of a child is an error in law.  Here, two \\nparents, both known to the Arbitrator and both having been previously working \\nwith the Arbitrator for some period of time, reached an agreement on a revised \\nparenting schedule.  Both parents must have believed at the time that the revised \\nparenting schedule was in the best interests of the children.  For some reason, \\nafterwards, the mother unilaterally failed or refused to uphold the agreement.  She \\nengaged in self-help. The parties had previously stipulated in writing that the \\nArbitrator “shall” issue an arbitral award incorporating the terms of any agreement \\nreached by them, which would include the agreement to revise the parenting \\nschedule (see footnote 4 of the Decision).  When the mother’s failure or refusal \\nto uphold the ASA was brought to the attention of the Arbitrator, he did exactly \\nthat – he made an award incorporating the terms of the parties’ written agreement \\n2024 ONSC 1867 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 4 of 4 \\n \\nto revise the parenting schedule.  But the Arbitrator did much more than simply \\nrubber-stamp the ASA; he addressed the mother’s arguments (the same ones \\nadvanced in this Court) and rejected them for the reasons given. \\n[12] The mother has failed to demonstrate any error in law.  Consequently, the \\nappeal had to be dismissed.   \\n[13] This Court has exercised its discretion to award in favour of the successful \\nfather substantial indemnity, rather than the more typical partial indemnity, costs \\nbecause of the mother’s obvious attempt to set aside the ASA in an improper \\nway, something she was expressly cautioned about by the Arbitrator, and what \\nthis Court, respectfully, would characterize as a misguided appeal.    \\n \\n \\n________________________ \\nConlan J. \\nReleased: March 28, 2024 \\n2024 ONSC 1867 (CanLII)\\n',\n",

Chozik \\nCOUNSEL: \\nDennis Van Sickle, for the applicant \\nRoy D’Mello, appearing for 11037315 Canada Inc., self-\\nrepresented  \\nHEARD: \\nAugust 24, 2023 \\nRULING ON MOTION \\nAND \\nREPORT ON REFERENCE \\nINTRODUCTION: \\n[1] \\nIn Martin v. 11037315 Canada Inc., 2022 ONCA 322 [Martin] the Court of \\nAppeal ordered a trial of an issue of the potentially bona fide sale of Kelly Martin’s \\n(“Martin”) property by 11037315 Canada Inc. (“110”) to 2670082 Ontario Corp. \\n(“267”). The Court of Appeal also ordered a reference of the accounting between \\nMartin and 110 pursuant to r.55.04 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, \\nReg. 194.  \\n[2] \\nThe principal of 110 is Roy D’Mello (“D’Mello”). He is also a lawyer. As the \\nprincipal of 110, he was summoned by Martin as a witness at the trial of the issue. \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 2 of 43 \\n \\nThat trial commenced before me on April 17, 2023 and, at the time of this hearing, \\nwas on-going.  \\n[3] \\nAlthough the trial of the issue and the reference are two separate hearings, \\nthey are under the same court file number. It is the same court file number that \\nwas originally assigned to Martin’s application to set aside the default judgment \\nheard by Gibson J. on December 10, 2020.  \\n[4] \\nOn May 30, 2023, I set the reference to be heard on August 24, 2023. This \\ndate was set in consultation with the trial coordinator and with the consent of Martin \\nand D’Mello.  \\n[5] \\nAt the reference, D’Mello brought a motion on behalf of 110 as its self-\\nrepresented principal and in his personal capacity, as a non-party. The relief \\nsought on the motion was that, (a) I recuse myself for bias or because my conduct \\nduring the trial of the issue gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, or, (b) \\nthat the reference be adjourned due to procedural irregularities. \\n[6] \\nI dismissed the motion with reasons to follow. The reference proceeded. At \\nthe conclusion of the reference, I found that D’Mello owed Martin $354,197.58 plus \\npre- and post-judgment interest pursuant to s.130 of the Courts of Justice Act, \\nR.S.O. 1990, c.43. I signed an Order prepared by Martin to this effect, and a copy \\nof that signed Order was provided to both parties. \\n[7] \\nThese are my reasons for dismissing D’Mello’s motion and the report on the \\nreference. \\n \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 3 of 43 \\n \\nBACKGROUND: \\nForeclosure and Sale of Martin’s Property: \\n[8] \\nThe factual background to this matter is set out in greater detail in the \\ndecision of the Court of Appeal in Martin, at paragraphs 7 to 35, as well the \\ndecisions of Gibson J. (Martin v. 11037315 Canada Inc., 2020 ONSC 8087 \\n[“11037315 Canada Inc.”]) and Kurz J. (1614358 Ontario Ltd. v. 2670082 Ontario \\nCorp., 2023 ONSC 1774 [“1614358 Ontario Ltd.”]).  \\n[9] \\nBriefly, in the fall of 2019, 110 obtained a default judgment for foreclosure \\nagainst Martin. Her cheque of $650, meant for her mortgage payment, had been \\nreturned by the bank earlier that summer when her bank account was frozen \\nbecause of a fraud investigation. Within 38 days of the default judgment \\n(November 20, 2019), 110 sold Martin’s property to 267.  \\n[10] \\nMartin did not know that 110 held her mortgage. She had a first mortgage \\nwith TD bank and obtained the second mortgage from a different numbered \\ncorporation, who then assigned it to 110 without notice to Martin.  When her \\ncheque bounced, no one made any demand for payment. She had provided post-\\ndated cheques for a year’s worth of payments, which no one ever cashed.  \\n[11] \\nThough she was served with 110’s Statement of Claim, Martin did not know \\nthat 110 had obtained default judgment against her or that the judgment entitled \\n110 to foreclosure. Foreclosure, of course, is not the same as a power of sale. \\nForeclosure transfers title to the property. Martin thought the action was for a \\npower of sale, to which she was agreeable. She tried to contact D’Mello, who was \\nidentified as 110’s lawyer in the Statement of Claim, to discuss the power of sale \\nbut he never returned her calls. \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 4 of 43 \\n \\n[12] \\nMartin did not know that within days of obtaining the default judgment, 110 \\nsold her property. This property was her home. She had owned it and lived there \\nsince 2010. 110 sold the property to 267 for $425,000. This was $150,000 less \\nthan its market value, which was $575,000. There was about $160,000 owing on \\nthe first mortgage to TD Bank and about $65,000 owing on the second mortgage \\nto 110, leaving approximately $350,000 in equity.  \\n[13] \\nAs a result of the foreclosure and the sale of the property by 110 to 267, \\nMartin’s equity and life savings were gone. She learned of all this when Paul Smith, \\na representative of Apex Property Management (“Apex”), knocked on her door on \\nJanuary 31, 2020 to evict her from the home. She refused to leave. \\n[14] \\nIn the meantime, 267 encumbered the property. Its purchase of the property \\nclosed on January 8, 2020, at which time 267 registered a new first charge in \\nfavour of Autodome Ltd. (“Autodome”) in the amount of $460,000. This was \\n$45,000 more than the purchase price. That mortgage was subsequently replaced \\nby two other mortgages: (i) a one-year charge registered on October 14, 2020 in \\nthe amount of $480,000 in favour of 1614358 Ontario Ltd. replaced the Autodome \\nfirst charge of $460,000, and (ii) a one-year second mortgage registered on \\nDecember 14, 2020 in the amount of $100,000 in favour of Ranjit Singh Pandher: \\nsee Martin, at paras. 29-30; 1614358 Ontario Ltd., at para. 3.  \\n[15] \\n267 then defaulted on those mortgages, resulting in judgments being \\nobtained against it. The property was sold as a result of 267’s default and Martin \\nwas evicted from her home in March 2023, just before the start of the trial of the \\nissue before me: 1614358 Ontario, at paras. 1 and 12.  \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 5 of 43 \\n \\nDecisions Setting Aside the Default Judgment: \\n[16] \\nWhen she learned of the foreclosure and sale of her property in January \\n2020, Martin immediately hired a lawyer and brought an application to set aside \\nthe default judgment obtained by 110 and the sale to 267. The motion was heard \\non December 10, 2020 by Gibson J. The only parties present were Martin and 267. \\n110 did not deliver a notice of appearance or participate in the proceeding. \\nAutodome delivered a notice of appearance but did not attend.  \\n[17] \\nGibson J. set aside the default judgment: 11037315 Canada Inc., at para. 7.  \\n[18] \\nThe decision of Gibson J. was upheld by the Court of Appeal in respect of \\n110. The Court of Appeal found at paras. 45-48 and 53, that: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThrough exercising its equitable jurisdiction, the court was able to reopen a \\nforeclosure order based on the particular circumstances of a case; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGibson J. fully considered the relevant factors set out in Winter v. Hunking, 2017 \\nONCA 909 including: \\no Whether the set aside motion was made with reasonable promptness, \\no Whether there is a reasonable prospect of payment of the mortgage at \\nonce or within a short time, \\no Whether the applicant for the set aside order has been active in \\nendeavouring to raise the money necessary, \\no Whether the applicant has a substantial interest in the property, or the \\nproperty has some special intrinsic value to them, \\no Where the property has been sold after foreclosure, whether the rights of \\nthe purchaser will be unduly prejudiced; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGibson J. answered the overarching question, whether the equities in favour of \\nsetting aside the default judgment outweighed the equities against doing so, in \\nthe affirmative; \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 6 of 43 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nGibson J. was also correct in his alternative conclusion that the default judgment \\nfor foreclosure and possession should be set aside because it was irregularly \\nobtained. \\n[19] \\nThe Court of Appeal ordered, at point 2 of paragraph 88, a reference of the \\naccounting in respect of the proceeds of the sale of the property by 110, having \\ndeemed that Martin filed a notice desiring a sale to 267.  The Court of Appeal \\nordered that “any references directed under this order be conducted by way of \\nmotions returnable in Milton or before a judge designated by the Regional Senior \\nJudge for Central West Region” [“RSJ”]: Martin, at para. 88.   \\n[20] \\nThe Court of Appeal also ordered a trial of the issue in respect of whether \\n267 was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice that Martin was occupying \\nthe property and may have had a claim to set aside the default judgment for \\nforeclosure: Martin, at para. 88. \\n[21] \\nAll the affected parties, Martin, 267 and 110, were parties to that appeal.  \\nThe Trial of the Issue - A Brief History of D’Mello’s Attendances Before Me: \\n[22] \\nThe trial of the issue commenced before me on April 17, 2023. It was \\nscheduled for three days. D’Mello, in his capacity as the principal or director for \\n110, was a witness in that trial.  \\n[23] \\nA pre-trial conference was held on March 22, 2023 before Associate Justice \\nJolley. Since the Court of Appeal gave no direction how the trial of the issue was \\nto proceed, it was determined that it would proceed as a quasi-application, based \\non affidavit evidence, with a brief examination-in-chief followed by cross-\\nexamination.  \\n[24] \\nThe endorsement of Jolley A.J. also reflects that Martin intended to summon \\nAnoop Dhillon, the real estate solicitor who acted for 267 on the sale of Martin’s \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 7 of 43 \\n \\nproperty by 110 to 267.  Jolley A.J. stated in her endorsement that Martin also \\nintended to summon “Roy D’Mello, the representative of 110037315, who obtained \\ntitle to the property by way of foreclosure and then sold it to 267”. Jolley A.J. \\ndirected Martin to summon these witnesses immediately. Jolley A.J. dismissed \\nMartin’s request to adjourn the trial for discoveries. \\n[25] \\nHence, when the matter came before me for trial on April 18, 2023, no \\ndiscoveries had taken place. \\n[26] \\n Prior to the trial, Martin summoned Dhillon. Dhillon attended on the first day \\nof the trial. He brought his file containing relevant documents as required by the \\nsummons. 267 waived solicitor-client privilege in respect of that file and Dhillon \\nturned his file over to Martin’s lawyer, Van Sickle, for examination. Dhillon was \\nasked to return on April 19, 2023 to testify. He complied. He gave evidence at the \\ntrial. His testimony completed on May 25, 2023. \\n[27] \\nHowever, as of the first day of trial, Martin had been unable to serve D’Mello \\nwith the summons. Efforts to serve him made by a professional process server \\nwere of no avail. Martin believed that D’Mello was evading service and asked for \\nan order for substituted service of the summons by email. I granted Martin’s \\nrequest. The summons was returnable the next day, April 18, 2023.  \\n[28] \\nOn April 18, 2023 D’Mello appeared before the court pursuant to the \\nsummons. He brought a small file of documents. Van Sickle asked to review those \\ndocuments, and court was briefly stood down for this purpose.   \\n[29] \\nAfter reviewing the documents, Van Sickle advised that the documents did \\nnot contain any emails whatsoever in respect of the transaction at issue. He asked \\nthat D’Mello be directed to produce the complete file and, in particular, that he be \\ndirected to produce all of the emails he has in relation to the sale of Martin’s \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 8 of 43 \\n \\nproperty to 267. I agreed and directed D’Mello accordingly. I also directed him to \\nproduce both a physical and electronic file, to which D’Mello agreed. \\n[30] \\nThe next day, on April 19, 2023 D’Mello returned before the court, with a \\nbanker’s box. He advised that he retrieved his physical file but was unable to scan \\nthe documents to produce them to the parties. He did not produce any portion of \\nan electronic file. Van Sickle was given an opportunity to review the documents in \\nthe banker’s box.  \\n[31] \\nIn D’Mello’s absence, counsel for the parties agreed that D’Mello met the \\ndefinition of an adverse witness for the purposes of r.53.07. I was also advised that \\nD’Mello was represented by 267’s counsel, Samir Chhina (“Chhina”) in another \\nproceeding.  \\n[32] \\nOn April 20, 2023, the last date set for the trial, the trial was not completed.  \\nD’Mello’s evidence had not begun. Further dates had to be set. I adjourned the \\nmatter to May 15, 2023 to set dates for the continuation of the trial. I remanded \\nD’Mello pursuant to the summons to May 15, 2023.  \\n[33] \\nBased on discussions with counsel, I was satisfied that a production order \\nneeded to be made in respect of other litigation 110 or D’Mello or any other \\ncorporations he was the principal of were involved in. I was also satisfied that the \\nproduction order extend to any litigation Karanpaul Randhawa was involved in.  \\n[34] \\nDhillon testified that Randhawa was his articling principle and that he \\ncontinued to work closely with him. There was evidence before me that the day \\nbefore 267 offered to buy Martin’s property from 110, a statement of adjustments \\nwas prepared to reflect the sale of Martin’s property for the exact same amount to \\nanother corporation. The two statements of adjustments were identical, except for \\nthe name of the purchaser. Both also pre-dated the Offer to Purchase made by \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 9 of 43 \\n \\n267. Randhawa was named as the lawyer for the other purchaser in that statement \\nof adjustments.  \\n[35] \\nEvidence also showed that the corporation purporting to buy Martin’s \\nproperty had been incorporated only days earlier by Paul Smith - the same Paul \\nSmith who worked for Apex and later came to evict Martin from her home. \\n[36] \\nOn April 20th, I explained the next steps in the trial and the production order \\nto D’Mello as follows: \\n The Court: All right. Thank you for returning today. I am adjourning this trial to \\nMay 15th at 2:15 p.m. Okay? It is to be spoken to at that time. You are under, \\nappearing here, pursuant to a summons. So, I am remanding you to May 15th at \\n2:15 p.m. It’s not expected that you will testify at that time, but we will set dates \\nat that time for further appearances, and I am ordering you to attend for that. A \\nconsequence of not attending before the court when you are remanded pursuant \\nto a summons is a possibility of a warrant being issued for your arrest. Okay. I’m \\ntelling you that because that is a consequence that can happen, and so it’s \\nimportant you attend. Okay? In addition, I am making a further order. You are to \\nprovide particulars of any litigation where you are named as a defendant, \\npersonally, or a corporation of which you are a principal is named as a \\ndefendant, or you are named as counsel for one of the parties, or in which \\nMr. Randhawa is named as a defendant, either personally or a corporation \\nof which he is a principal is named as a party, or he’s named as counsel. \\nOkay? The particulars you are to provide include copies of any court orders \\nthat have been made, endorsements or decisions of the court that have \\nbeen made, and the evidence filed with the court in respect of those \\nproceedings if the evidence is within your possession and control. You are \\nto provide this information to both Mr. Chhina and Mr. Van Sickle by 4:30 p.m. on \\nWednesday April 26th. Since you don’t have a pen and paper to write down what \\nI’ve said, Mr. Chhina will email you what it is you need to produce. Okay?  \\n[Emphasis added] \\n[37] \\nIn the following exchange, I also explained to D’Mello that an order excluding \\nwitnesses had been made as follows:  \\nTHE COURT: […] And I am making one further, well I’ve already made an order \\nexcluding witnesses. As part of the order excluding witnesses, you are not to \\ndiscuss evidence that has been given in this proceeding with anyone. So that \\nmeans you can’t, you know, you’re not to get the information about what has \\nbeen said in his proceeding, and you are not to talk about the evidence in this \\nproceeding with anyone. Do you understand?  \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 10 of 43 \\n \\nMR. D’MELLO: Yes. \\nTHE COURT: Okay. Do you have any questions? \\nMR. D’MELLO: No. I do not. \\nTHE COURT: So thank you for attending today. I apologize for the \\ninconvenience again, because I know you are taking time out of your busy \\nschedule, but you need to return at 2:15 on May 15th. I expect that would be, \\nyou won’t be testifying at that time, and it won’t be very long that you’re here. \\nHopefully we can resolve the dates of the next steps relatively quickly, so we \\nwon’t keep you very long. \\nMR. D’MELLO: Okay. \\nTHE COURT: Okay and thank you. \\nMR. CHHINA: Sorry, Your Honour, one more thing, his file, I understand has \\nbeen, my friend’s done with it. It’s here. I don’t need it. He can take it back as \\nfar as it’s up to me. \\nTHE COURT: I think it’s a good idea that you take your file so that way you have \\nit in case you need it to prepare for the trial.  \\n[38] \\nI ordered the transcripts of the directions and order I made, appended those \\ntranscripts to the endorsement and ensured that it was emailed by the registrar to \\nthe parties and to D’Mello.  \\n[39] \\nOn May 15, 2023, D’Mello attended before the court. At that time, I set dates \\nfor the continuation of the trial for May 25, 30 and June 1, 2023. All dates were set \\nin court, in consultation with the trial coordinator in chambers. This is a usual \\npractice in Milton. D’Mello was present when these dates were set.  \\n[40] \\nOn that day, Van Sickle advised that he had only received partial \\nproductions from D’Mello.  I reiterated to D’Mello that the production of the \\ndocuments regarding the other litigation involving him, 110, Dhillon or Randhawa \\nwas important. D’Mello expressed concerns that providing “an affidavit of \\ndocuments” in respect of other proceedings would violate the deemed \\nundertakings rule in r. 30.1.01(3). I explained to him that he need not produce the \\n“affidavit of documents” from those other proceedings, but produce only that which \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 11 of 43 \\n \\nis already public record such as pleadings or endorsements. I also told him to \\nadvise counsel if he had any concern about disclosing a particular document in his \\npossession. I reiterated that the deadline for the productions was 4:30 pm on April \\n26, 2023.  It had already passed.   \\n[41] \\nOn May 25, 2023, Van Sickle advised that he had still not received full \\nproduction pursuant to the order I made.  D’Mello was not present before the court \\nthat day. Van Sickle also advised that he had contacted the RSJ to request the \\nappointment of a judge to hear the reference as ordered by the Court of Appeal, \\nand that the RSJ had directed him to raise the issue before me in order for me to \\ndecide how to proceed. The email from the RSJ to Van Sickle was read and \\nmarked as lettered Exhibit E on the trial of the issue.  \\n[42] \\nFollowing a break, I advised the parties that I had spoken with the acting \\nRSJ Tzimas and that she appointed me to hear the reference. I then directed Van \\nSickle to contact the trial coordinator to set a date for the hearing of the reference. \\nThe trial of the issue was adjourned to May 30, 2023   \\n[43] \\nOn May 25, 2023 I made the following endorsement, and ordered that a \\ncopy of it be provided to D’Mello:  \\nTrial continued. Adjourned to May 30, 2023 at 10:00 am for continuation. \\nThe Applicant shall, by May 30, 2023 serve and file affidavit evidence in respect \\nof the particulars produced by Mr. Demelo [sic] pursuant to the order I made on \\nApril 20, 2023. The affidavit shall be served on Mr. Chhina, counsel for “267” and \\non Mr. Demelo [sic] by email. \\nPursuant to prior directions given, Mr. Demelo [sic] is to attend before the court \\non May 30, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. At that time, he may be required to address \\nwhether he has complied with my order of April 20, 2023 and whether he is in \\ncontempt in the face of the court.  \\nThe Applicant may file evidence at this trial of the various proceedings involving \\nMr. Demelo [sic], his corporations, Mr. Mangal, his corporations, Mr. Dhillon and \\nMr. Karanpaul Singh Randhawa by way of affidavit. I set no timeline and gave no \\ndirection in this regard today as the inherent requirements of the affidavit depend, \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 12 of 43 \\n \\nin part, on Mr. Demelo’s [sic] compliance with this court’s order for productions of \\nparticulars made on April 20, 2023. \\nThe Applicant may also seek consolidation of the various proceedings by way of \\na motion with notice to all the parties, if she chooses. Mr. VanSickle indicated \\nthat this is not likely. \\nPursuant to the direction of the Acting Regional Senior Justice R. Tzimas, I am \\nappointed to hear the reference directed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in this \\nmatter. The reference shall be scheduled through the trial coordinator at the next \\nappearance. \\nA copy of this endorsement shall be provided to the parties, including Mr. Demelo [sic].  \\n[44] \\nOn May 30, 2023, I received the affidavit of Ula Swiezawska dated May 29, \\n2023. This affidavit set out what Martin said D’Mello produced and did not produce \\nin response to my order of April 20, 2023. Martin took the position that D’Mello had \\nnot fully complied with my order. \\n[45] \\nVan Sickle advised that he had discovered a total of eight other on-going \\nmortgage actions in which D’Mello and/or 110 and/or another corporation of which \\nD’Mello was the principal were named as defendants. These actions were \\nproceeding in Brampton, Toronto and Hamilton. According to Van Sickle, as of the \\ndeadline I had set for productions, April 26, 2023, D’Mello had only disclosed two \\nof those actions. As of May 15, 2023, and only in response to Van Sickle’s \\ninquiries, D’Mello produced documents for three more actions. One of these \\nundisclosed actions also appeared to involved Apex Financial Corp. and Anthony \\nForgione (whose name had come up in the trial of the issue) and Shan Mangal, \\nthe principle of 267.  \\n[46] \\nVan Sickle made these submissions in D’Mello’s absence. When D’Mello \\nthen came before me, I told him that I had reason to believe that he had not \\ncomplied with my order of April 20, 2023 to produce certain documents by the April \\n26, 2023 deadline. I explained to him that the affidavit of Ula Swiezawska set out \\nMartin’s version of what he had and had not produced. A copy of that affidavit was \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 13 of 43 \\n \\nprovided to D’Mello. I advised D’Mello that I intended to exercise the court’s \\ninherent jurisdiction to inquire into whether he had complied with my order of April \\n20, 2023 and, if he had not, whether he should be found in contempt of the court. \\nD’Mello asked for an opportunity to consult with counsel, which I granted. The \\nmatter was adjourned to June 1, 2023. \\n[47] \\nIn my endorsement, dated May 30, 2023, I reiterated:  \\nMr. D’Mello attended before the court today pursuant to a summons. He is a \\nwitness in the trial of an issue I am conducting as directed by the Court of \\nAppeal for Ontario. As I explained to Mr. D’Mello, I am exercising the inherent \\njurisdiction of this court to embark on an inquiry into whether Mr. D’Mello is in \\ncontempt in the face of court for failing to comply with my order for production, \\nmade on April 20, 2023. \\nThe court received today the affidavit of Ula Swiezawska, dated May 29, 2023. \\nIt was served yesterday on both Mr. D’Mello and the Respondent, “267”. It \\nforms the evidentiary foundation for the inquiry into whether Mr. D’Mello is in \\ncontempt of court. To be clear, I make no findings as to contempt at this time. \\nMr. D’Mello shall have an opportunity to respond. He may consult with counsel \\nin order to do so. Since a finding of contempt carries the possibility of \\nimprisonment and is quasi-criminal in nature, Mr. D’Mello is entitled to \\nconstitutional and procedural safe-guards, including the right to silence. He \\nmay, but is not required to, file evidence to respond or choose to give evidence \\nunder oath or call other vica voce evidence. Today, he was advised that the \\ncourt is embarking on this inquiry and the matter was adjourned to June 1, \\n2023 at 10:00 am in person for continuation to give him an opportunity to speak \\nto a lawyer.  \\nAttached to this Endorsement is a portion of the transcript of April 20, 2023 \\ncontaining the order and directions that I made in respect of the productions \\nMr. D’Mello was to make.  \\n[48] \\nAlso on May 30, 2023, while D’Mello was before the court, Van Sickle \\nindicated that he had not heard back from the trial coordinator about scheduling \\nthe reference for a hearing. The trial coordinator then joined the courtroom by \\nZoom and the date of August 24, 2023 for the reference was selected. Both Van \\nSickle and D’Mello agreed to that date.  \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 14 of 43 \\n \\n[49] \\nAt that time, with D’Mello before the court, there was a discussion about the \\nrules and procedures applicable to the reference. Van Sickle was of the view that \\nthe reference was proceeding under r.64.06 dealing with mortgage references \\ngenerally and r.55 which sets out procedures on references. D’Mello heard Van \\nSickle’s submissions. He took no issue with the rules or procedures discussed. He \\nmade no submissions and did not ask any questions, though I invited him to. \\n[50] \\nI then set the timetable for the reference. I proposed that D’Mello file 110’s \\naccounts by June 30, 2023, Martin file any objections by July 21, 2023, and D’Mello \\nfile any answers by August 4, 2023. D’Mello agreed to this timetable. I invited both \\nVan Sickle and D’Mello to re-attend before me should they require further direction \\nin respect of the reference.  \\n[51] \\nIn the endorsement of May 30, 2023, in respect of the reference, I stated:  \\nThe Court of Appeal also directed a reference pursuant to rule 64.02 of the \\nRules of Civil Procedure. I have been assigned to conduct that reference by \\nthe Acting Regional Senior Justice R. Tzimas. The reference, though distinct \\nfrom the trial of the issue, is under the same court file number. \\nThe date of the hearing of that reference is set for August 24, 2023 at 10:00 \\nam in person (2 hours set aside).  \\nMr. D’Mello shall serve and file his accounts by 4:30 pm on June 30, 2023. \\nMs. Martin, the Applicant, may serve and file any objections by 4:30 pm on \\nJuly 21, 2023. Mr. D’Mello shall serve and file any response to the objection \\nby 4:30 pm on August 4, 2023. If, once all of the materials have been served \\nand filed, the parties require direction from the court, they may request a virtual \\nappearance before me by contacting the trial coordinator.  \\nD'Mello’s First Motion for Recusal – At The Trial of The Issue: \\n[52] \\nOn June 1, 2023, Mr. D’Mello attended and was represented by Paul \\nRobson. Robson had represented 267 at the pre-trial conference before Jolley A.J. \\nRobson (and Samir Chhina, counsel for 267 at the trial of the issue). Both acted \\nfor 110 and 267 in this matter when it was before the Court of Appeal.  \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 15 of 43 \\n \\n[53] \\nRobson argued that I should recuse myself for bias. He argued that by \\ninquiring into whether D’Mello had complied with the production order, my conduct \\nevinced bias or gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. He argued that \\nthere should not be any contempt proceeding, and, in the alternative, any contempt \\nproceeding should be dismissed.  \\n[54] \\nWhile I did not accept Robson’s arguments, I did not embark on any further \\ninquiry or contempt hearing. Rather, I permitted D’Mello a further opportunity to \\ncomply with the April 20, 2023 order and produce the required evidence so that \\nthe trial of the issue could continue.  \\n[55] \\nIn my endorsement dated June 1, 2023, I clarified that D’Mello was to \\nproduce the following:  \\n1. The particulars of any of the litigation in which he is named a \\ndefendant or respondent either personally or in which a \\ncorporation of which he is the principal is named as a defendant \\nor respondent in litigation. By “particulars” I mean the name of \\nthe case of the style of cause, the court file number if he has it \\nand the jurisdiction where it is proceeding or has proceeded. \\n2. Any publicly available documents in the litigation described in \\nparagraph 1 above, such as pleadings, court orders or \\nendorsements or evidence if those documents are in his \\npossession or control. He need not produce any evidence that \\nhas not been made part of the public record in the proceeding. \\n3. The particulars of any litigation he is aware of in which Mr. \\nRandhawa is named as a defendant or respondent either \\npersonally or in which a corporation in which he is the principal is \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 16 of 43 \\n \\nnamed as a defendant or respondent in litigation. By “particulars” \\nI mean the name of the case or the style of cause, the court file \\nnumber if he has it and the jurisdiction where it is proceeding or \\nhas proceeded. \\nI clarified that: \\n4. D’Mello need NOT produce particulars of litigation in which he or \\nRandhawa are counsel at this time, but may be asked to do so \\nas the trial unfolds if it becomes relevant. \\n5. D’Mello is not required to produce particulars of any action that \\nis not related to mortgage or financing proceedings (such as \\nmotor vehicle or family proceedings for example), or where he is \\nthe initiating party as the plaintiff or applicant. \\n[56] \\nI adjourned the matter to July 4, 2023 to be spoken to for the purpose of \\nensuring that D’Mello had complied with the order so that the trial of the issue could \\ncontinue. I invited the parties and D’Mello to request a virtual attendance before \\nme at any time to address any issues with the production or other procedural \\nmatters. The trial was adjourned to August 4, 2023 for continuation. \\n[57] \\nOn July 4, 2023 counsel for Martin and 110 confirmed that they were ready \\nto continue the trial on August 4, 2023. D’Mello was to testify that day. \\n[58] \\nOn August 4, 2023 the trial could not continue. D’Mello did not attend. He \\nsent a note from a doctor stating that he was ill “from July 31 to August 7, 2023”. \\nThe trial was adjourned for continuation on October 12, 2023.  \\n[59] \\nOn August 4, 2023 I made the following endorsement in respect of the \\nreference: \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 17 of 43 \\n \\nUnder this same court file number is the Reference ordered by the Court of \\nAppeal. That hearing was previously set to proceed on August 24, 2023. Mr. \\nD’Mello was ordered to serve and file his accounts by June 30, 2023. None \\nwere served or filed. No extension of the deadline was sought by Mr. D’Mello, \\nthough the parties were invited to seek direction if they needed it. It is \\nassumed, therefore, that he intends to file no material or accounts. \\nOn the Reference, Mr. Van Sickle and Mr. D’Mello shall attend before me on \\nAugust 10, 2023 by zoom to be spoken to at 10:00 am.  \\n[60] \\nOn August 10, 2023, Van Sickle and D’Mello attended before me to speak \\nto the reference. 267 did not attend. D’Mello had served and filed this motion (for \\nmy recusal and adjournment of the reference), but had not served or filed any \\naccounts or records related to the reference.  \\n[61] \\nI explained to D’Mello that I would hear his motion on August 24, 2023. I \\ngranted him a further extension to serve and file his accounts or any other materials \\nhe intended to rely on for the reference. I explained that if his motion is dismissed, \\nthe reference would proceed.  \\n[62] \\nI endorsed that:  \\n The timetable set for filing of materials on the Reference set out the \\ndeadlines. No materials on behalf of 11037315 have been served or filed on \\nthe Reference. No extension has been sought. Mr. D’Mello submits that he \\nneeds one week to serve and file those materials. He shall have until \\nFriday, August 18, 2023 by 4:30 pm to serve and file the accounts and \\nany other materials he intends to rely on in respect of the Reference on \\nbehalf of 11037315. No further extension shall be granted. This Order \\napplies to 11037315, who is the named party in this proceeding. [Emphasis \\nadded] \\n[63] \\nOn August 24, 2023, I heard and dismissed this motion. The reference \\nproceeded. D’Mello had not filed any accounts or made any claims. I made findings \\non the reference, as I set out orally and now in the report below. I signed an Order \\nprepared by Martin setting out the particulars of my findings on the reference.   \\n[64] \\nOn October 12, 2023, the trial of the issue continued. D’Mello testified. His \\ntestimony continued on October 23, 2023. The evidentiary portion of the trial \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 18 of 43 \\n \\nconcluded that day. Closing submissions were heard on November 28, 2023. I \\nreserved the decision on the trial of the issue.  \\nPOSITIONS OF THE PARTIES: \\n[65] \\nOn this motion, D’Mello took the position that he is a non-party entitled to \\nrelief. He argued that he is not a defendant and seeks a declaration to this effect. \\nD’Mello argued that I must recuse myself from presiding over the reference \\nbecause of bias, or because my conduct during the trial of the issue gave rise to a \\nreasonable apprehension of bias. In the alternative, he seeks an adjournment of \\nthe reference for procedural irregularities. \\n[66] \\nIn particular, D’Mello argued that I should recuse myself from hearing this \\nreference because: \\na. As a witness in the trial of the issue, he and 110 have been \\nexcluded and therefore could not order transcripts of the \\nproceedings in support of this motion; \\nb. I exercised my inherent jurisdiction to inquire whether D’Mello \\nwas in contempt of court; \\nc. I embarked on an inquiry into whether D’Mello breached a \\nMareva injunction made by Dennison J. on July 24, 2019;  \\nd. I stated that D’Mello was a “defendant” in the reference; \\ne. I stated that a warrant would be issued for D’Mello’s arrest if \\nhe did not attend the hearing on October 12, 2023. \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 19 of 43 \\n \\n[67] \\nIn the alternative, D’Mello argued that the reference be adjourned due to \\ncertain procedural irregularities, including lack of notice and non-compliance with \\nthe Rules of Civil Procedure. \\n[68] \\nMartin opposed my recusal and an adjournment of the reference. She took \\nthe position that my conduct did not give rise to bias or give rise to a reasonable \\napprehension of bias. Rather, she argued, this motion is a tactic by D’Mello to \\nattempt to delay what is otherwise a straightforward accounting for the proceeds \\nof the sale of Martin’s property required by 110. \\n[69] \\nMartin did not disagree that D’Mello is a non-party – the reference is between \\nMartin and 110. The trial of the issue is between Martin and 267. Any orders, \\nincluding the order for production, were made against 110, not D’Mello personally.  \\n[70] \\nMartin submitted that any procedural irregularities did not require an \\nadjournment of the reference. \\nANALYSIS: \\nLegal Principles - Bias: \\n[71] \\nThe legal test for determining whether a trial judge’s conduct evinced bias \\nor a reasonable apprehension of bias was articulated by de Grandpré J. \\n(dissenting) in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board (1976), \\n[1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, at p. 394 as follows: \\nWhat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and \\npractically -- and having thought the matter through -- conclude. Would he \\nthink that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether \\nconsciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly. \\n[72] \\nThis test contains a two-fold objective element: the person considering the \\nalleged bias must be reasonable, and the apprehension of bias itself must also be \\nreasonable in the circumstances of the case: R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 20 of 43 \\n \\nat para. 111. Further, the reasonable person must be an informed person, with \\nknowledge of all the relevant circumstances, including,  \\nthe traditions of integrity and impartiality that form a part of the background and \\napprised also of the fact that impartiality is one of the duties the judges swear to \\nuphold…. [T]he reasonable person should also be taken to be aware of the social \\nreality that forms the background to a particular case,[…]  \\n[Citations omitted; Emphasis in original.] \\n[73] \\nThe jurisprudence indicates that a real likelihood or probability of bias must \\nbe demonstrated and that a mere suspicion is not enough. The existence of a \\nreasonable apprehension of bias depends entirely on the facts: R. v. MacMillan, \\n2024 ONCA 115, at para. 77. The threshold for such a finding is high and the onus \\nof demonstrating bias lies with the person who is alleging its existence: R. v. Gager, \\n2020 ONCA 274, at para. 153, leave to appeal refused, [2020] S.C.C.A. No. 444. \\n[74] \\nAs Benotto J.A. wrote in MacMillan, at para. 78, the application of this test \\nis framed by: (i) a strong presumption of judicial impartiality, which accords judicial \\ndecision makers considerable deference on appeal; (ii) a high burden on the part \\nof the party alleging bias; (iii) a contextual assessment of the alleged bias, i.e., the \\ninstances of alleged bias (e.g., inappropriate, unjustified, or improper comments) \\nare not to be considered in isolation, rather, the question should be whether the \\nalleged bias influenced the decision-making process; (iv) the broad discretion \\nafforded to trial judges in exercising trial management powers to ensure a trial \\nremains “effective, efficient and fair to all parties” (this includes the power to \\nintervene to focus the evidence on material issues, clarify evidence, avoid \\nirrelevant or repetitive evidence, dispense with proof of obvious or uncontested \\nmatters, ensure that the way a witness answers questions does not unduly hamper \\nthe progress of the trial, or prevent a trial from being unnecessarily protracted); \\nand (v) the presence of a jury during the impugned conduct: see e.g., Yukon \\nFrancophone School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General), \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 21 of 43 \\n \\n2015 SCC 25, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 282, at paras. 25-26; R. v. John, 2017 ONCA 622, \\n350 C.C.C. (3d) 397, at para. 47-51; Gager, at paras. 144, 152-53. \\nApplication: The Recusal Motion: \\n[75] \\nWith these principles in mind, I conclude that, whether viewed individually or \\ncumulatively, the concerns raised by D’Mello on this motion do not establish bias \\nor give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.  \\n[76] \\nI address each issue in turn. \\n(a) Is D’Mello a Non-Party or Entitled to Relief? \\n[77] \\nD’Mello argues that I have named him personally and made orders against \\nhim personally, which reveals bias or gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of \\nbias. I disagree. Any reasonable informed observer would understand that \\nD’Mello’s involvement in this matter is in his capacity as the principal for 110, which \\nis self-represented.  \\n[78] \\nRule 15.01(2) requires a corporation to be represented by a lawyer, except \\nwith leave of the court. Rule 15.03(2) requires a corporation to file a notice of \\nappointment of a lawyer by filing Form 15B. 110 has not sought leave under \\nr.15.01(2) or filed a form 15B.  110 never sought an opportunity to retain a lawyer \\neither. Instead, with Martin’s consent, I exercised my discretion to allow D’Mello to \\nrepresent 110 as a self-represented person.  \\n[79] \\nD’Mello wears many hats. As I have set out, he is the principal of 110, the \\ncorporation which is a party to these proceedings. That corporation is a “witness” \\nat the trial of the issue in the sense that it has custody of evidence relevant to the \\nissues before the court. Since a corporation cannot testify or produce documents, \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 22 of 43 \\n \\nD’Mello, who controls the documents, is named as the witness and subject to the \\nsummons, but only in his capacity as principal of that corporation.  \\n[80] \\nD’Mello is also a lawyer. But he has been clear that he is not the lawyer \\nrepresenting 110. He has not appeared gowned at any time before me and has \\nnever signed in as its counsel. However, he has represented 110 as its lawyer at \\nother times. For example, when he filed the Statement of Claim against Martin in \\nthis court and obtained the default judgment against her, his name was on the \\ncourt documents as 110’s lawyer. He acts as counsel in a number of other matters \\nbefore the courts. \\n[81] \\nDespite his many hats, D’Mello is not personally a party to these proceeding. \\nThe trial of the issue is between Martin and 267. D’Mello appeared in that \\nproceeding as a witness.  The reference directed by the Court of Appeal is for an \\naccounting by 110 to Martin. The party to the reference is therefore 110. D’Mello \\nis involved in the reference as the principal for 110.  Any remarks I made to or \\nabout D’Mello in these proceedings were not intended at D’Mello personally and \\ncould not reasonably have been mistaken as such. The directions and orders \\nmade in these proceedings were directed at D’Mello as the principal of 110.  \\n[82] \\nWhen the date for the hearing of the reference was set on May 30, 2023, I \\ntold D’Mello that he could appear on behalf of 110 as self-represented or he could \\nretain counsel on behalf of 110. For 110, he chose to remain self-represented. \\n[83] \\nD’Mello complains that in my endorsement of May 30, 2023 under the \\ncolumn titled “counsel” I named him as the “Defendant” in the reference. This was \\nan obvious error. The registrar usually prepares that portion of endorsements. No \\nreasonable person informed of all the circumstances would conclude that this slip \\nsomehow converted D’Mello into a defendant personally on the reference. Nor \\ndoes this error establish bias or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 23 of 43 \\n \\n[84] \\nTo the extent that D’Mello brought this motion for my recusal on his own \\nbehalf as a non-party, it must be dismissed. All his submissions are therefore taken \\nto be made by 110. He has not established that he ought to be given standing. As \\na non-party, Mr. D’Mello is not entitled to relief from this court. He has no standing \\nto bring this motion in his personal capacity or to take any position on this reference \\nin his personal capacity. \\n[85] \\nHe asks for a declaration that “Roy D’Mello” is not a defendant in any \\nreference. There is no issue in this regard. I agree, and Martin agrees, Roy D’Mello \\nis not a party to these proceedings. He is not the defendant in this reference. The \\nreference is for an accounting of the proceeds of the sale of Martin’s property by \\n110 to 267.  \\n[86] \\nThis does not absolve D’Mello of his obligation to account as a principal of \\n110, nor does it intend to limit his personal liability in this application in any way. \\nHis personal liability at large is not for me to determine at this time. But naming \\nhim as the “defendant” or addressing him as “D’Mello” is not bias and does not \\ngive rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.   \\n(b) D’Mello’s \\nPurported \\nInability \\nto \\nAccess \\nTranscripts \\nof \\nthe \\nProceedings: \\n[87] \\nD’Mello argued that since he and 110 could not obtain transcripts of the trial \\nof the issue because of the order excluding witnesses at the trial of an issue, I must \\nrecuse myself. He submitted that there may be further evidence of bias or evidence \\ngiving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, which he could not access. I do \\nnot accept this argument. \\n[88] \\nD’Mello and 110 could have obtained transcripts of the proceedings in \\nsupport of this motion. A witness exclusion order applies to evidence, not \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 24 of 43 \\n \\ndiscussions about the process or procedures for the reference or the trial of the \\nissue. \\n[89] \\nD’Mello has not adduced any evidence that he has been denied the ability \\nto order transcripts of the trial of the issue. He has not sought any direction from \\nme regarding ordering the transcripts. Had he asked, I would have allowed it. All \\nthe transcripts of each appearance were produced at my request and, had he \\nasked, I could have easily reviewed those transcripts and, in consultation with the \\nparties, had the relevant portions that did not include evidence produced to him.  \\n[90] \\nI find that D'Mello has not been denied the ability to access relevant \\ndocuments in support of his motion.  \\n[91] \\nI have, out of an abundance of caution, reviewed all of the transcripts and \\nfind that there is no further evidence that could establish bias or give rise to a \\nreasonable apprehension of bias of which D’Mello was not aware.   \\n(c) The Contempt Inquiry at the Trial of the Issue: \\n[92] \\nD’Mello argued that I exhibited bias when I embarked on an inquiry into \\nwhether he had complied with the production order I made on April 20, 2023 and \\nwhether he should be held in contempt. I do not agree.  In my view, the inquiry into \\nwhether D’Mello had complied with my order was fully justified based on the \\ninformation and evidence before me. No contempt proceeding was held. Moreover, \\nthe production order was necessary in order to compel the production of relevant \\nevidence at the trial of the issue.  This was especially so since no discoveries had \\ntaken place in advance of the trial. \\n[93] \\nThe ability of the court to control its own process and ensure that its orders \\nare complied with is within the inherent jurisdiction of the court: Canaccede Credit \\nLP v. Schulz-Hallihan, 2021 ONSC 4851, at para. 10. Contempt in the face of the \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 25 of 43 \\n \\ncourt may be broadly described as any word spoken or act done in, or in the \\nprecincts of, the court which obstructs or interferes with the due administration of \\njustice or is calculated so to do. Conduct which amounts to contempt outside the \\ncourt may be described in general terms as words spoken or otherwise published, \\nor acts done, outside court which are intended or likely to interfere with or obstruct \\nthe fair administration of justice: Cowan, Re, 2010 ONSC 3138, 68 C.B.R. (5th) \\n248, at para. 16. \\n[94] \\nIn B.C.G.E.U., Re, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 214, the Supreme Court of Canada held \\nthat in certain circumstances, a breach of a court order undermined a court's \\nauthority, and that even though the immediate parties chose not to proceed, the \\ncourt could act on its own. There are many other instances where this authority \\nhas been upheld and acted upon: Foothills Provincial General Hospital Board v. \\nBroad et al. (1975), 57 D.L.R. (3d) 758 (Alta. T.D.); Churchman v. Joint Shop \\nStewards' Committee of Workers of the Port of London, [1972] 1 W.L.R. 1094 \\n(C.A.); Con-Mech (Engineers) Ltd. v. Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, \\n[1973] I.C.R. 620; R. v. United Fishermen and Allied Workers’ Union (1967), 63 \\nD.L.R. (2d) 356 (B.C.C.A.). \\n[95] \\nWhile the jurisdiction of the court is not unlimited, the court may exercise its \\ninherent jurisdiction to control its process in a way that secures convenience, \\nexpediency, and efficiency in the administration of justice and do what is necessary \\nto do justice between the parties: Canaccede Credit LP, para. 50. To this end, \\ncourts can, and do, prosecute contempt on their own motion, but generally only in \\nthe case of in facie contempt: Cowan, paras. 22 and 27.  \\n[96] \\nI find that a reasonable informed person would not conclude that I was \\nbiased in making an inquiry into whether D’Mello has complied with the order for \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 26 of 43 \\n \\nproductions. Concerns about non-compliance or delayed compliance and resulting \\ndelays of the trial of the issue arose from the outset of the trial. For example: \\na. D’Mello could not be summoned – an order for substituted \\nservice was obtained at the commencement of the trial; \\nb. When D’Mello attended in response to the summons, he did not \\nbring any of the required documents; \\nc. When D’Mello initially produced his file to Van Sickle for \\nexamination, he produced only a partial file. He did not include \\nany emails whatsoever in respect of the transaction in issue; \\nd. D’Mello told Van Sickle that he initially interpreted my order for \\nproduction as requiring him to produce only those matter in \\nwhich he, Dhillon and Randhawa were conjunctive defendants \\nwhen this was obviously not the case;  \\ne. The deadline for the productions was April 26, 2023. As of May \\n15, 2023 only partial productions had been made. As of May 25, \\n2023 only partial productions had been made. As of May 30, \\n2023 no further productions had been made. \\n[97] \\nOn June 1, 2023, D’Mello attended before the court. He was represented by \\nPaul Robson on that day, who sought my recusal at that time. Rather than embark \\non a contempt hearing, I gave D’Mello a further opportunity to produce the required \\ndocuments. The order I made on April 20, 2023 set a deadline of April 26, 2023.  \\nIt was not satisfied until July 4, 2023. \\n[98] \\nIn the circumstances, I am of the view that a reasonable person fully \\napprised of the circumstances would not view the exercise of the inherent \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 27 of 43 \\n \\njurisdiction of the court to inquire into whether its order was complied with as biased \\nor as giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. \\n[99] \\nI am also of the view that the production order itself was reasonable and \\nnecessary in the circumstances. The critical issue at the trial of the issue was \\nwhether 267, or its principal Mangal, had actual knowledge of Martin’s claims \\nagainst 110. Mangal testified that he had done business with D’Mello before but \\ndenied having any knowledge of Martin’s claims. He acknowledged that he \\npurchased the property knowing that someone was living in it and that it was most \\nlikely the owner. He did not inspect the property before he bought it. \\n[100] Evidence of multiple proceedings involving D’Mello and his corporations, the \\nconnections between D’Mello, his corporations, Mangal, Mangal’s corporations \\nand their lawyers including Dhillon and Randhawa was potentially relevant to 267’s \\nstate of knowledge. The fact that both Mangal and D’Mello used Apex Property \\nManagement and associated with Apex Financial Corporation was potentially \\nrelevant. Whether 267 was an arm’s length purchaser was a live issue. Mangal’s \\ncredibility, as well as Dhillon’s, were at issue at the trial.  \\n[101] At the trial of the issue, evidence was adduced that Martin’s motion against \\n110 to set aside a default judgment improperly obtained was not the only case in \\nwhich it was alleged that 110 abused the court’s rules to improperly obtain default \\njudgments to enforce its mortgages.  Rather, the affidavit of Ula Swiezawska set \\nout that there were at least eight such on-going actions against D’Mello, 110 and \\n9706161 Canada Ltd., one of D’Mello’s other corporations.

For example, Paul Robson and Samir Chhina acted for 110 and 267 \\non the appeal in Martin. Robson then appeared before me as D’Mello’s lawyer on \\nthe recusal motion. Chhina acts for 267 on the trial of the issue. Randhawa acted \\nfor the non-party lender on the appeal in the Court of Appeal, as well as for Paul \\nSmith’s corporation on the aborted purchase of Martin’s property. Dhillon acted for \\n267 on the sale of Martin’s property by 110 to 267. He testified that he articled with \\nRandhawa and continues to work closely with him. \\n[104] Further, based on the evidence at the trial of an issue and available caselaw, \\nit is apparent that Robson was counsel for D'Mello in Sapusak v. 9706151 Canada \\nLtd., 2023 ONSC 5122. Chhina was counsel for D'Mello in Sapusak v. 9706151 \\nCanada Ltd., 2023 ONSC 197 (Div. Ct.), Sapusak v. 9706151 Canada Ltd., 2023 \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 31 of 43 \\n \\nONSC 196 (Div. Ct.). Randhawa represented a non-party, Ranjit Singh Pandher, \\nin Martin. \\n[105] Randhawa and Dhillon were respondents in Sheth v. Randhawa, 2022 \\nONCA 89. In this same case, Robson represented other respondents. In Sheth v. \\nRandhawa, 2022 ONCA 707, Randhawa and Dhillon were respondents and \\nChhina represented other respondents. Chhina and Randhawa represented \\ndifferent defendants in Tang v. Xpert Credit Solutions Inc., 2023 ONSC 4580. \\nChhina and Randhawa were deposed during this matter, and it appears that \\nRandhawa was represented at the deposition by Robson.  \\n[106] In Fatahi-Ghandehari v. Wilson, 2022 ONSC 4799, Chhina took over in \\nrepresenting Wilson when Robson was suspended by the Law Society of Ontario. \\nAffidavits proffered on Robson's motion for a stay in Law Society of Ontario v. \\nRobson, 2022 ONLSTA 12, were made by Chhina and Randhawa.  \\n[107] Robson and Chhina were both counsel for the plaintiffs in Ntakos Estate v. \\nNtakos, 2021 ONSC 2492. Chhina is counsel for the respondents, including Shan \\nMangal (the principal of 267 and a witness at the trial of the issue before me) in \\nChan v. Mangal, 2022 ONSC 2068. In the body of the judgment, Randhawa is also \\nidentified as a lawyer of Mangal's. \\n[108] Given this web, the production order I made was more than justified. \\n[109] In any event, no inquiry into contempt of court took place. D’Mello was given \\na further opportunity to comply with the order without the need for such an inquiry.  \\n[110] Ultimately, whether or not D’Mello complied with the production order or his \\nconduct at the trial of an issue has nothing to do with this reference. I am prepared \\nto and have disabused myself entirely of the evidence and the events at the trial \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 32 of 43 \\n \\nof the issue. That evidence and events are unrelated to the issues on the \\nreference, which is a straightforward accounting. \\n[111] Nothing I have heard or decided at the trial of the issue is of any relevance \\nor assistance in respect of the reference. The ultimate issues are not the same \\nand do not overlap whatsoever. The issue at the trial is whether 267 was a bona \\nfide purchaser of Martin’s property from 110. The reference is an accounting for \\nthe proceeds of the sale of the property, and nothing else. \\n(d) Inquiry into Whether D’Mello Breached a Mareva Injunction: \\n[112] D’Mello argues that I evinced bias or gave rise to a reasonable apprehension \\nof bias by embarking onto an inquiry into whether he breached a Mareva injunction. \\nAs of the date of the hearing of this motion, the court has not embarked on any \\nsuch inquiry. Evidence was adduced at the trial of the issue that at the time of the \\nsale of Martin’s home to 267, D’Mello and 110 were subject to a Mareva injunction \\nmade by Dennison J. on July 23, 2019. This prohibited D’Mello and 110 from \\ndealing with any assets when he sold Martin’s property to 267. No further evidence \\nwas heard in this regard and no inquiry was made. Unless Mangal knew about the \\nMareva injunction, it is not relevant to the issues at trial.   \\n(e) My Endorsement that D’Mello Is a Defendant in the Reference: \\n[113] As I set out in para. 83 above, identifying D’Mello as a defendant in the \\nreference in a brief endorsement is of no consequence. No reasonable informed \\nperson would conclude that I was biased as a result, nor would this typographical \\nerror give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.  \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 33 of 43 \\n \\n(f) The Caution that a Warrant for Arrest Could Issue for a Witness who \\nDoes Not Attend Court Pursuant to a Summons: \\n[114] D’Mello argued that I evinced bias or gave rise to a reasonable \\napprehension of bias because I noted, in an endorsement dated August 4, 2023, \\nthat a warrant could issue for his arrest if he did not attend at the trial on October \\n12, 2023. I observe that I also said that a warrant could issue for the arrest for a \\nwitness who does not attend for trial on the very first day D’Mello appeared before \\nme as a witness. \\n[115] A warrant can issue for the arrest of any witness who does not appear when \\nsummoned or fails to produce documents in response to a summons or subpoena: \\nr.53.04(7). As a trial judge, it is my obligation to explain relevant procedures to self-\\nrepresented litigants. This is especially true where the failure to comply could result \\nin serious consequences, such as a warrant being issued.  \\n[116] In my view, there was good reason to caution D’Mello as to the \\nconsequences of not complying with court rules. It was not the first time D’Mello \\nwas cautioned by this court. In D’Mello v. Sapusak et al., 2023 ONSC 970, Daley \\nJ. commented on D’Mello’s claimed illness and whether he was too sick to attend \\ncourt or was simply attempting to prolong proceedings. Daley J. made the following \\nfindings in respect of D’Mello’s conduct: \\n[42] D’Mello has shown absolute disregard for the court’s orders. \\n[45] The intended purpose of the applications is patently obvious and transparent; \\nnamely, to circumvent this court’s rules of procedure and process and to continue \\nthe campaign of stonewalling and delay of the underlying civil action. \\n[52] Finally, it is evident that D’Mello has no regard whatsoever for the orders and \\ndirections provided by this court and as such the needs of the administration of \\njustice in carrying out the orderly management of civil proceedings also favours \\nthe denial of the adjournment request. \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 34 of 43 \\n \\n[117] In another case, D’Mello v. Sapusak, 2023 ONSC 3088, Daley J. said the \\nfollowing: \\n[15] As set out in my earlier decision, both applications constituted proceedings \\nin the nature of appeals and were collateral attacks on the orders made in the \\nunderlying action and therefore I concluded they were an abuse of the courts \\nprocess. \\n[16] That conclusion applies equally to the respondent’s present motions in both \\napplications. \\n[22] The applicant is a lawyer licensed to practice law in Ontario and from the \\nhistory of these proceedings and the underlying litigation, it is evident that he is \\nentirely familiar with the intricacies of the Rules of Civil Procedure. \\n[23] Apart from my conclusions that the applications constitute an abuse of the \\ncourt process and further that they had no hope of success, these ill-conceived \\napplications are not proceedings that are otherwise authorized to be instituted as \\napplications under Rule 14.05 and on that basis as well the applications must be \\ndismissed. \\n[118] In the case before me, D’Mello could not be served with the summons. An \\norder for substituted service by email had to be obtained. He did not really comply \\nwith any order I made or the timelines I set. He did not attend on the day he was \\nsupposed to testify. The trial was adjourned repeatedly, in part because of his \\nactions. 267 often expressed concerns with the pace of the trial.  \\n[119] Concerns about D’Mello’s non-attendance were not unreasonable in the \\ncircumstances. Concerns about further delays of the trial because of his non-\\nattendance and non-compliance were not unreasonable in the circumstances. It \\nwas important that D’Mello understood the potential consequences for non-\\ncompliance and non-attendance.  \\n[120] In my view, setting out the potential consequences for non-compliance with \\ncourt directions or non-attendance when summoned as a witness does not reveal \\nbias or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of a reasonable \\ninformed observer of the circumstances.  \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 35 of 43 \\n \\n[121] For all of these reasons, I declined to recuse myself. \\nProcedural Irregularities: \\n[122] Mr. D’Mello argued that the reference should not proceed because:  \\na. 110 was not properly served with a Notice of Motion in \\naccordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure; \\nb. The scheduling of the reference was not done through the trial \\ncoordinator; \\nc. The rules and/or statutory provisions upon which Martin relies \\nwere not stated;   \\nd. D’Mello did not have a copy of the direction or endorsement of \\nTzimas J. who assigned me to hear the reference in her \\ncapacity as the Acting Regional Senior Justice for Central \\nWest Region; \\ne. As a self-represented litigant, he needed more time to \\nconsider his position and retain counsel. \\n[123] I did not accept these arguments. \\n[124] In my view, 110 was put on notice of the reference by the decision of the \\nCourt of Appeal in Martin. The reference was directed by the Court of Appeal. All \\nof the affected parties, including 110, were parties to that appeal. Neither 110 nor \\nD’Mello could have been under any misapprehension what the reference was for \\nor what rule it was proceeding under. \\n[125] The Court of Appeal’s direction in respect of the reference was clear: it could \\nproceed either by motion or by appointment of a judge to hear the reference by \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 36 of 43 \\n \\nthe RSJ at the request of either party. There is nothing in the Martin decision of the \\nOntario Court of Appeal directing the reference requiring a notice of motion be \\nserved if a judge was appointed by the RSJ to act as the referee.   \\n[126] D’Mello could not have been under any misconception as to the rules in \\nrespect of the reference. The Court of Appeal stated that the reference was \\npursuant to r.55.04. D’Mello was also present before me on May 30, 2023 when \\nthe rules were discussed. The correct rule for the reference is r. 54.02. My \\nendorsement states r. 64.02. This is an obvious typo. D’Mello could not have been \\nmisled by it because the rules and the process were discussed in his presence. \\nHe took no issue with the applicable rules during that discussion and did not ask \\nany questions though he given an opportunity to do so. \\n[127] As I have already set out, D’Mello is a lawyer. He advised me that he is a \\nlawyer in good standing with the Law Society of Ontario. I find that he is familiar \\nwith the Rules of Civil Procedure.  His name appears as the lawyer for 110 on the \\nStatement of Claim against Martin and he moved for default judgment against \\nMartin on behalf of 110. He also acts as a lawyer in at least come of the other court \\nproceedings of which I am aware. I am confident that he understands civil litigation \\nand how to use the rules.  \\n[128] Ordinarily, when a reference is ordered, the party having carriage of the \\nreference seeks an appointment before the referee for a hearing for directions:  r. \\n55.02(1). Once that appointment is obtained, a notice of hearing for directions is \\nserved on all parties to the proceeding at least five days before the hearing “unless \\nthe referee directs or these rules provide otherwise”: r. 55.02(2).  \\n[129] The formality of r.55.02(1) and (2) was unnecessary in the circumstances. \\nThe Court of Appeal ordered the reference and put 110 on notice of this by virtue \\nof its decision. Acting RSJ Tzimas appointed me as the referee and I advised the \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 37 of 43 \\n \\naffected parties (Martin and 110) of this when they were both before me in court. \\nA date for the reference was canvassed with both Martin and 110.  D’Mello agreed \\nto the date in his capacity as the principal of 110.   \\n[130] As a lawyer, D’Mello was reasonably aware that he was entitled to request \\nan opportunity to obtain independent legal advice for the corporation. He did not \\nraise any concern about scheduling the reference without having consulted or \\nretained a lawyer. He subsequently consulted and retained a lawyer, Robson, who \\nattended before me on the first motion for recusal.  Neither Robson nor D’Mello \\nraised any concerns about the reference at that time. D’Mello had almost three \\nmonths from the time the reference was set for hearing until the hearing to consult \\nwith a lawyer or retain one. He chose not to.  \\n[131] D’Mello agreed to the timetable I set for the service and filing of his accounts.  \\nAs a lawyer, he ought to have been aware of the consequences of agreeing to a \\ntimetable on behalf of 110. He did not request to have a timetable put over to a \\nfurther hearing for 110 to retain a lawyer to be present. \\n[132] 110 did not comply with the agreed upon timetable. There was no request \\nto extend the deadlines I ordered. On August 10, 2023, I asked D’Mello if he \\nneeded more time for 110 to file its accounts.  D’Mello said that he needed a week. \\nI granted him that extension, to August 18, 2023, but D’Mello still did not serve or \\nfile any accounts or other materials on the reference. I find that that D’Mello’s \\nfailure to file any accounts was an attempt to delay the reference and obstruct it \\nfrom proceeding.  \\n[133] Having been appointed as the referee, I fixed a date for the hearing of the \\nreference. Both Martin and 110 agreed to the date. I proposed a timetable for \\nservice and filing of materials.  Martin and 110 agreed to the timetable. 110 did not \\ncomply with the timetable. I granted it an extension. It still did not comply with that \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 38 of 43 \\n \\ndeadline. The reference proceeded without any accounts from 110. There is \\nnothing unfair about this process.   \\n[134] In all of the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there were any procedural \\nirregularities in how the reference was set down for hearing or how it proceeded. \\nIn the alternative, any procedural irregularities did not warrant an adjournment of \\nthe hearing.  \\nCONCLUSION ON THE MOTION: \\n[135] For these reasons, the motion to recuse myself and, in the alternative, \\nadjourn the reference, was dismissed.  \\nREPORT ON THE REFERENCE: \\n[136] On August 24, 2023, at the conclusion of the hearing of the reference, I \\nprovided my report orally, with a written report to follow. The following is the written \\nreport.   \\n[137] Pursuant to r. 64.06(16), the referee must set out in his or her report the \\nfollowing: \\na. the names of, \\n(i)  all persons who were parties on the reference, \\n(ii)  all subsequent encumbrancers who were served with notice of the \\nreference, and \\n(iii)  all subsequent encumbrancers who failed to attend on the reference \\nand prove their claims; \\nb. the amount and priority of the claims of the parties who attended and \\nproved their claims on the reference, and the report shall show those \\nparties as the only encumbrancers of the property; and \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 39 of 43 \\n \\nc. the date on which the report was settled. \\n[138] The parties to the reference were Martin and 110. Notice of the reference, \\nas I set out above, was given to Martin and 110. Both Martin and 110 attended at \\nthe reference. No one else attended at the reference. There was no evidence of \\nany claims on the reference. Martin acknowledged, however, that she owed \\n$71,055.78 to 110 at the time of the sale of her property.  \\n[139] 110 sold the property to 267 for $425,000. There is no claim by 110 for any \\ncosts or expenses associated with that sale. There is no evidence of any loans, \\nmortgages or encumbrances 110 paid to sell the property. There is no evidence of \\nany fees, legal expenses or other costs. Therefore, I find that 110 has not proven \\nany claims or additional amounts owing to it on the reference. \\n[140] Prior to the reference, D’Mello, on behalf of 110, emailed a document with \\nsome figures to Van Sickle but it was marked without prejudice. No supporting \\ndocumentation in respect of those figures was provided. I give no effect to the \\ndocument. It was not properly adduced in evidence or put forward by 110 on the \\nreference. \\n[141] Based on the unchallenged evidence before me, I found that 110 was owed \\n$71,055.78 by Martin. When I deduct that amount from the sale proceeds as \\nadjusted of $425,253.36 obtained by 110, the balance owing is $354,197.58.  I \\ntherefore found that 110 must pay to Ms. Martin $354,197.58 plus pre and post \\njudgment interest.  \\n[142] Ordinarily on a reference, Martin (who has carriage of the reference) would \\nprepare the draft report:  r. 55.02(20) and serve it on 110, and file a copy with proof \\nof service: r.55.02(21).  The parties would then fix a date to settle the report on \\nnotice: r. 55(19)-(21) before the referee. The referee would then confirm the report \\nby signing it.  Once the report is signed, since the Court of Appeal did not require \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 40 of 43 \\n \\nany report back, it would be confirmed within 15 days of service by operation of r. \\n54.09(1).  It would then be entered and issued: r.59.05(1). See also Exteriors By \\nDesign v. Traversy, 2012 ONSC 6369, at paras. 53-57. The report would then take \\neffect as a judgment. \\n[143] In my view, it is not strictly necessary to follow these procedures in this case. \\nThe Order I signed at the conclusion of the hearing conforms in substance to this \\nreport. I have already settled it, signed it and a copy was already provided to \\nD’Mello. Within 15 days from the release of this decision, it may be entered and \\nissued. This is the most expeditious and least expensive process to achieve a just \\nresult between the parties, which is what the Rules of Civil Procedure intend: \\nr.1.04(1). \\n[144] In conclusion, I found on the reference that 110 owed Ms. Martin \\n$354,197.58 plus pre- and post-judgment interest pursuant to s. 130 of the Courts \\nof Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43. The Order I signed shall within 15 days be \\nentered and issued and take force as a judgment. \\nCOSTS: \\n[145] At the conclusion of the hearing on August 24, 2023, I invited Martin and 110 \\nto settle the issue of costs of the motion and reference. Failing that, I invited the \\nparties to make written submissions with respect to the costs. The deadline for \\ncompleting the costs submissions was September 8, 2023. 110’s submissions on \\ncosts were to have been served and filed by 4:30 pm on September 6, 2023. \\n[146] To date, no submissions in respect of costs were received from 110.  \\n[147] Martin, as the successful party on the motion, is entitled to her costs of the \\nmotion. She seeks costs in the amount of $9,023.33 on a substantial indemnity \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 41 of 43 \\n \\nbasis. She is also entitled to her costs of the reference, which are included in this \\nquantum.  \\n[148] Rule 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure lists the various factors to be \\nconsidered in fixing and awarding costs. The court is directed to consider, amongst \\nother things: \\n\\uf0b7 the amount of costs that an unsuccessful party could reasonably \\nexpect to pay in relation to the step in the proceeding for which \\ncosts are being fixed,  \\n\\uf0b7 the amount claimed and the amount recovered in the proceeding,  \\n\\uf0b7 the complexity of the proceeding,  \\n\\uf0b7 the importance of the issues,  \\n\\uf0b7 the conduct of the parties, and \\n\\uf0b7 whether any step in the proceeding was improper, vexatious, or \\nunnecessary, or taken through negligence, mistake, or excessive \\ncaution.  \\n[149] The court has a broad discretion in fixing costs under s. 131 of the Courts of \\nJustice Act. In Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario \\n(2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.), at paras. 24-26 and 38, the Court of Appeal held \\nthat costs must be fair and reasonable and within the expectation of the parties. \\nProportionality is a governing principle and must be considered by the judge fixing \\ncosts. \\n[150] In fixing costs, my objective is to consider the factors set out in r. 57.01 and \\nidentify an amount that is fair and reasonable. Specifically, I must identify an \\namount that is fair and reasonable for an unsuccessful party to pay in these \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 42 of 43 \\n \\nparticular circumstances, rather than an amount fixed by the actual costs incurred \\nby Martin. \\n[151] Martin argues that the court should express its disapproval of 110’s failure \\nto abide by a litigation timetable on the reference to which it had consented. While \\nI agree in principle, the reality is that 110’s failure to file any accounts benefitted \\nMartin.  As a result, I decline to impose costs on a substantial indemnity scale.   \\n[152] With respect to quantum, 110 did not take issue with the costs sought. 110 \\ndid not file a costs outline, so there is nothing to compare or to suggest that Martin’s \\ncosts are either unreasonable or disproportionate.   \\n[153] The issues on this reference were straightforward, but extremely important \\nto Martin. As a result of the default judgment improperly obtained by 110, she lost \\nher home and all of the equity in it. She lost her life’s savings. The accounting for \\nthe sale proceeds was critical to her. As I have said, I disabused my mind of the \\nevidence of D’Mello’s conduct in all of the other proceedings.   \\n[154] On the unchallenged or undisputed materials before me, I am satisfied that \\nthe quantum of costs sought by Martin is reasonable in the circumstances. \\n[155] Costs are awarded on a partial indemnity scale in the amount of $6,015.56 \\nfor this motion and reference.  \\n[156] 110 shall pay costs of the motion and the reference to Martin of $6,015.56 \\ninclusive of disbursements and HST forthwith.  \\n \\n__________________ \\nChozik J. \\nReleased: March 28, 2024 \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n \\nPage 43 of 43 \\n \\nCITATION: Martin v. 11037315 Canada Inc., 2024 ONSC 1877 \\nCOURT FILE NO.: CV-20-0650-0000 \\nDATE: 2024 03 28 \\nONTARIO \\nSUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE \\n \\nKelly Martin, Applicant \\n– and – \\n11037315 Canada Inc., Respondent \\n \\nRULING ON MOTION \\nAND \\nREPORT ON REFERENCE \\n \\n \\nChozik J.  \\n \\n \\nReleased: March 28, 2024 \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1877 (CanLII)\\n\",\n",

(3d) 1. \\n2024 ONSC 1889 (CanLII)\\n- 2 - \\n \\n \\n[2] The applicant is charged with one count of fraud over $5000, and a breach of \\ntrust with intent to defraud, pursuant to their respective provisions in the \\nCriminal Code, RSC 1985, c. C-46. \\n[3] The applicant’s case is in the Ontario Court of Justice and a preliminary inquiry \\nis scheduled for October, 2024. \\n[4] This hearing commenced before me with viva voce evidence adduced by the \\napplicant. Following her evidence, I raised a threshold issue as to whether the \\napplication ought to continue on the basis of the record filed. Having reviewed \\nthe relevant materials and hearing the submissions of counsel, I ruled that the \\napplication was premature and without the appropriate conditions precedent in \\nplace. The application was adjourned pending certain procedural steps to be \\nundertaken by the applicant. These are my brief reasons. \\nPreliminary Issue: \\n \\n[5] Without delving into the merits of the application, the issue at this juncture is \\nwhether the applicant had taken all of the necessary steps in advance of this \\nhearing to request that her Rowbotham application be considered by this court. \\n[6] Counsel for the applicant asserts that the jurisprudence provides that his client \\ncan move for such an application and a stay of proceedings pending the \\ngranting of this application, without having to submit a formal application to \\nLegal Aid or, if unsuccessful, having filed an appeal or review undertaken. \\n[7] Counsel submits that the proper interpretation of the first prong of the \\nRowbotham criteria, read disjunctively, provides that an individual can review \\nthe legal aid income threshold and criterion online, and then determine whether \\nhe or she is eligible for legal aid funding based on one’s own income. It is \\nsubmitted that this is not only permissive but can be accomplished without \\n2024 ONSC 1889 (CanLII)\\n- 3 - \\n \\n \\nhaving to proceed with the formal hurdle of submitting an application or an \\nappeal or through the established prerequisite steps for such an application. \\n[8] I did not have to call on the Crown for any legal submissions. \\n \\nDiscussion of Legal Principles: \\n \\n[9] In accordance with the Rowbotham principles, a court’s determination of \\nwhether to stay proceedings to ensure a fair trial pending the appointment of \\npublicly funded counsel, depends on the applicant satisfying all three of the \\nfollowing conditions: \\ni. The applicant is ineligible for or has been refused Legal Aid and has \\nexhausted all appeals for reconsideration of his eligibility; \\nii. The applicant is indigent and unable to privately retain counsel to \\nrepresent him; and \\niii. The applicant’s right to a fair trial will be materially compromised absent \\npublic funding for counsel. \\n[10] \\nThe onus is on the applicant to satisfy each of these factors, including a \\nbasis to establish the likelihood of a s. 7 Charter violation. There is no absolute \\nright to counsel in order for an accused to receive a fair trial. \\n[11] \\nIt is the first criterion at issue here. Apparently, the applicant contacted Legal \\nAid but never made any formal application to be provided with state-funded \\ncounsel. Instead, she relied on some information provided to her. \\n[12] \\nWith respect, counsel for the applicant misinterprets the law regarding the \\nRowbotham application process. I reject counsel’s interpretation of the \\n“disjunctive language” as referenced in some of the cases referring to the first \\nof the three prong test in Rowbotham. I also disagree that there will always be \\nsome circumstances where an application to Legal Aid in the first instance will \\nbe “futile”, and hence there is no need to submit an application to Legal Aid. \\n2024 ONSC 1889 (CanLII)\\n- 4 - \\n \\n \\n[13] \\nThe applicant’s approach to the legal analysis to sustain avoidance of the \\nLegal Aid process is incongruent in the jurisprudence and in reference to some \\nof the language in the cases referred to in argument. For example, Carpenter- \\nGunn J.’s obiter comments on page 3 of R. v. Strong, (unreported) referring to \\nthe “ineligibility or refusal of Legal Aid, may be standard prose, but does not \\naddress the well-established process as outlined in Rowbotham, at para. 167, \\nand its progeny. In fact, the preponderance of the prevailing jurisprudence \\nsuggests otherwise. \\n[14] \\nIn other words, while an individual may be “ineligible” per se, it does not \\nnegate an accused’s onus or responsibility to apply for legal aid. \\n[15] \\nIn order to advance a request for state-funded counsel through the \\nauspicious of a Rowbotham application, the applicant must comply with the \\nrecognized and well- established procedures. Such conditions precedent entail \\nthat an individual must first apply for legal aid and must be subsequently \\nrejected on the basis of the criteria established by Legal Aid, which includes an \\nassessment of income. Next, the applicant must advance an appeal of that \\ndecision and await the results. If the appeal is denied, a further review is \\nrequired in most cases, with the eventual determination of a denial of funding.1 \\n[16] \\nIt is settled law that a trial judge has a discretion to order a stay of \\nproceedings pending state-funded counsel. In R. v. Rushlow, 2009, 96 O.R. \\n(3d) 302 (C.A.), Rosenberg J.A., writing for the court stated: \\nThis Court has never said that a Rowbotham Order is limited to an extreme \\ncase where Legal Aid’s decision is completely perverse and there is a \\nsubstantial possibility of lengthy imprisonment. Nor need the case be one \\nposing “unique challenges.” The authorities hold that the case must be of \\n \\n \\n1 In some limited cases, the final step of a “review” from the LAO committee’s appeal decision \\nmay not be a bar to bringing a Rowbotham application. For example, see R. v. Conklin, 2012 \\nONSC 5259, at paras. 30-31. \\n2024 ONSC 1889 (CanLII)\\n- 5 - \\n \\n \\nsome complexity, but a requirement of unique challenges puts the threshold \\ntoo high. It is enough that there is a probability of imprisonment and the case \\nis sufficiently complex that counsel is essential to ensure that the accused \\nreceives a fair trial. \\n \\n[17] \\nVarious Superior courts have held that there is an evidentiary burden on the \\napplicant and requires the applicant to demonstrate that all aspects of the \\napplication for publicly-funded counsel are properly supported and \\nsubstantiated on the record: R. v. Kizir, 2014 ONSC 1676. \\n[18] \\nIn R. v. Peterman, [2004] O.J. No. 1758, 70 O.R. (3d) 481, Rosenberg J.A., \\nfor the court, had occasion to re-address the Rowbotham criteria, (albeit the \\nissue was counsel’s rate in excess of the legal aid tariff.) Nonetheless, he \\nconfirmed the applicable process and stated at para. 22, as follows: \\nIn some cases legal aid has been refused because in accordance with legal \\naid guidelines the person does not qualify financially for legal aid. Where \\nthe accused seeks a Rowbotham order the court while giving appropriate \\ndeference to the decision of legal aid must reach his own decision about \\nwhether the accused can afford counsel. As stated in Rowbotham at page \\n69 C.C.C., ‘there may be rare circumstance in which legal aid is denied but \\nthe trial judge, after an examination of the means of the accused, is satisfied \\nthat the accused because of the length and complexity of the proceedings \\nor for other reasons cannot afford to retain counsel to the extent necessary \\nto ensure a fair trial.’ However when a court makes a Rowbotham order, it \\nis not conducting some kind of judicial review of the decision made by legal \\naid authorities rather, it is fulfilling its independent obligation to ensure that \\nthe accused receives a fair trial. \\n \\n[19] \\nI observe that in the case of R. v. Bancroft, 2019 ONSC 1931, Ratushny J. \\ndenied a Rowbotham application for one set of charges arising out of Belleville, \\nas the applicant failed to complete the application process for Legal Aid: at \\nparas. 26-28. She also commented on whether the final denial or review was \\nnecessary in the circumstances of the case: at para. 31. This presupposes that \\nthe applicant initiated the original application to Legal Aid. \\n[20] \\nIn Bancroft, at para. 3, the jurist reiterated that “the courts determination of \\nwhether to stay proceedings pending the appointment of publicly funded council \\n2024 ONSC 1889 (CanLII)\\n- 6 - \\n \\n \\ndepends on the applicant satisfying all three of the following prerequisites on \\nthe balance of probabilities: (a) Legal Aid: the applicant is ineligible or has been \\nrefused legal aid and has exhausted all appeals for reconsideration of his \\neligibility …” \\n[21] \\nIn R. v. Martel, [2009] 94 O.R. (3d) 60, (C.A.) at para. 8, the court stated: \\n \\nIn our view, the respondent’s decision not to avail himself of the legal \\nrepresentation available to him through the Legal Aid services cannot be \\nequated with the denial of Legal Aid. On the facts of this case, it is agreed \\nthat legal representation was available and that council was prepared to act \\nfor the respondent under the terms of the certificate offered by Legal Aid. In \\na circumstance of this case he denial of Legal Aid was a prerequisite to the \\ngranting of a Rowbotham order. Absent that denial, there was no need to \\nconsider the other factors relevant on a Rowbotham application. \\n \\n[22] \\nIn R. v. Odah, 2016, ONSC 6370, Durno J. held at para. 13: “A failure to \\nprovide full and frank financial disclosure to LAO or providing materially different \\ninformation on the court application will be relevant on the Rowbotham application. \\nThe onus is on the applicant and a finding that he or she failed to provide full and \\nfrank financial disclosure to LAO has the potential to impact on his or her credibility \\nand or reliability on the Rowbotham application: See also paras. 6, 7, and 8. \\n[23] \\nIn sum, the applicant must avail herself of the well-established process for \\nstate-funded counsel through Legal Aid – and be denied on appeal and review, as \\none of three fundamental criteria prior to seeking a Rowbotham application. As \\nmentioned the jurisprudence is replete with this form of direction: For example, see \\nR. v. James, 2011 O.J. No. 4651, at paras. 20, 22, R. v. Abbott, 2016 ONSC 1284, \\nat para. 9; R. v. Chugta, 2021 ONSC 1735, at para. 20; R. v. Myers, [2016] O.J. \\nNo. 7326, at para. 16; R. v. Lascelles-Williams, 2011 ONSC 7406, at paras. 5 – 7; \\nR. v. Montpelier, [2002] O.J. No. 4279 (S.C.) at para. 37; R. v. Atkinson, 2017 \\nONSC 2658, at para. 10; R. v. Baoteng, 2011 ONSC 739, at paras. 6, 16-17. \\n2024 ONSC 1889 (CanLII)\\n- 7 - \\n \\n \\nConclusion: \\n \\n[24] \\nThe Rowbotham application is adjourned. The conditional stay will be \\nextended for 30 days and may continue, provided that the applicant takes the \\nappropriate steps and provides a fulsome and complete application to Legal Aid, \\nwithout undue delay. Should an appeal of any denial to the local area committee \\nbe required, the stay may be continued if the applicant undertakes such appeal \\nexpeditiously. Following an unsuccessful appeal, a review is generally necessary. \\nHowever, in this case, given the imminent date for the preliminary inquiry, such a \\nreview may not necessarily be required, if time is of the essence. \\n[25] \\nAny failure to take the appropriate, timely steps in advance of the potential \\nRowbotham application will warrant a lifting of the stay. This order is made without \\nprejudice to the applicant to renew this application, should the appropriate factors \\nbe satisfied. \\n \\n \\n______________________ \\nA. J.

L\\'avis informait ses résidents que la Municipalité \\navait l\\'intention d\\'effectuer des travaux dans la ruelle. \\n[4] \\nCertains habitants ont fait savoir à la Municipalité qu\\'ils refusaient de se conformer à la \\ndirective émise par la Municipalité. \\n[5] \\nLes intimés, Louis Godard et Sylvie Cléroux refusent de reconnaître que la ruelle appartient \\nà la Municipalité de Casselman. Ils affirment qu\\'un contrat verbal conclu avec le maire de \\nCasselman en juillet 1986 leur confère la propriété de la ruelle située à proximité de leurs \\nrésidences. \\n[6] \\nCompte tenu de cette position, la Municipalité de Casselman a introduit la présente requête. \\n[7] \\nTous les intimés, sauf Louis Godard (ci-après Godard) et Sylvie Cléroux (ci-après \\nCléroux), ont consenti à la requête de la Municipalité de Casselman. \\n[8] \\nLes preuves essentielles présentées au tribunal sont des affidavits et leurs pièces connexes, \\nainsi que des transcriptions de contre-interrogatoires.

La Municipalité de Casselman, Louis Godard et Sylvie Cléroux ont-ils conclu un \\ncontrat verbal en juin ou juillet 1986 transférant la propriété de la ruelle contiguë à \\nleurs propriétés respectives du 15, rue Martin et du 7, rue Martin de la Municipalité \\nà Godard et Cléroux ? \\nb. Si un tel contrat oral existe, y a-t-il suffisamment d\\'actes d\\'exécution partielle pour \\nque l\\'entente échappe à l\\'article 4 de la Loi relative aux preuves littérales ? \\n \\n \\n \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nLes éléments de preuves \\nLa preuve présentée par Louis Godard \\n[14] \\nM. Godard est l\\'un des deux intimés restants dans cette requête. Il a fourni une déclaration \\nsous serment et a été contre-interrogé par l\\'avocat de la requérante. \\n[15] \\nIl est propriétaire du 15, rue Martin à Casselman, en Ontario. Cette propriété est adossée à \\nla ruelle contestée. \\n[16] \\nAvant d\\'acheter le lot du 15, rue Martin pour y installer sa maison familiale, il avait acheté \\nles lots 6 et 8 de la rue Filion à Casselman en 1973. La propriété porte aujourd\\'hui l\\'adresse \\n36, rue Filion. À l\\'époque, le terrain est vacant, comme la plupart des terrains des rues \\nMartin et Filion. \\n[17] \\nM. Godard utilise la propriété de la rue Filion pour cultiver un potager annuel et occupe \\ncontinuellement la moitié de la ruelle derrière sa propriété. \\n[18] \\nEn 1975, il déménage une maison d\\'Ottawa au 15, rue Martin. C\\'est là qu\\'il réside \\nprincipalement depuis cette époque. La plupart des terrains étaient vides et les gens \\nutilisaient la ruelle comme jardin ou pour élever de petits animaux tels que des lapins, des \\noies ou des poulets. En 1978, Godard a construit une petite structure dans la ruelle pour \\nélever des chapons. \\n[19] \\nLa preuve de Godard est que la Municipalité n\\'a pas accédé à la ruelle Martin-Filion, ne l\\'a \\npas utilisée, ne l\\'a pas entretenue et n\\'en a pas manifesté le besoin depuis qu\\'il a acheté la \\npropriété de la rue Filion en 1973. Jusqu\\'au dépôt de la présente requête, il n\\'a jamais reçu \\nd\\'avis de la Municipalité à l\\'effet qu\\'elle continuait de revendiquer des droits de propriété \\nsur le terrain de la ruelle en litige. \\n[20] \\nAprès l\\'excavation et la construction des fondations de la maison Godard au 15, rue Martin \\nen 1975, la propriété a été nivelée au même niveau que la propriété voisine. Selon Godard, \\nles propriétés étaient environ trois pieds plus élevés que le terrain de la ruelle Martin-Filion \\nsitué immédiatement à l\\'arrière. La pente derrière les cours arrière des résidences causait \\ndes problèmes récurrents de flaques d’eau que Godard et son voisin n\\'arrivaient pas à \\nrésoudre. \\n[21] \\nEn 1975 ou 1976, après avoir soulevé auprès de la Municipalité un problème de formation \\nde flaques d\\'eau dans la ruelle, deux employés de la Municipalité, M. Lucien Lafontaine et \\nM. Roland Bray, ont rencontré M. Godard pour faire le point sur la situation. Les deux \\nemployés lui ont dit que la Municipalité n\\'avait pas l\\'intention d\\'entreprendre des travaux à \\ncet endroit et que, essentiellement, c\\'était à lui, en tant que propriétaire voisin, de remédier \\nà la situation. M. Lafontaine et Bray lui ont recommandé de remblayer le terrain à ses frais \\net d\\'installer un ponceau en façade de sa propriété afin d\\'assurer un drainage adéquat le \\nlong de cette rue. M. Godard affirme qu\\'il a donc entrepris les démarches recommandées \\npar les employés municipaux à ses frais. Il a commandé du gravier, de la terre végétale et \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nun ponceau et a procédé au remplissage de l\\'espace de la ruelle selon les instructions. Il en \\na profité pour créer un espace de stationnement accessible depuis la rue Francess. \\n[22] \\nGodard déclare avoir vendu le 36, rue Filion en 1984. Les propriétaires suivants ont utilisé \\nla ruelle jusqu\\'à aujourd\\'hui. \\n[23] \\nUn an ou deux avant les élections municipales de 1985, Godard affirme avoir eu une \\nconversation au sujet de la ruelle avec Raymond Levac, alors membre du conseil municipal \\nde Casselman. M. Levac habitait au 40, rue Filion, directement derrière la résidence \\nGodard. Selon M. Godard, comme tous les autres propriétaires, M. Levac occupait et \\nutilisait lui aussi la moitié de la ruelle Martin-Filion, la traitant comme si elle lui \\nappartenait. \\n[24] \\nLors de cette conversation, M. Levac a dit à Godard que le Conseil municipal de Casselman \\navait discuté de ce qu\\'il fallait faire avec les ruelles de leur quartier. Plus précisément, M. \\nLevac a dit à Godard qu\\'il y avait eu des discussions sur la possibilité de creuser un fossé \\ndans la ruelle Martin-Maria, le bloc immédiatement à l\\'est, de l\\'autre côté de la rue Martin \\npar rapport à sa propriété. Le fossé aurait servi à faciliter le drainage à l\\'arrière des \\npropriétés de ces rues. \\n[25] \\nGodard affirme que M. Levac lui a dit que les membres du Conseil avaient décidé que la \\nMunicipalité n\\'avait pas les fonds nécessaires pour entreprendre des projets de drainage de \\nce type. M. Levac a déclaré que les conseillers avaient conclu qu\\'il serait préférable que les \\npropriétaires des terrains adjacents utilisent et entretiennent chacun la moitié des deux \\nruelles : celle entre les rues Martin et Maria, ainsi que la ruelle Martin-Filion qui fait l\\'objet \\nde la présente demande. Le transfert de la responsabilité des ruelles aux propriétaires privés \\néliminerait tout besoin pour la Municipalité d\\'entretenir l\\'espace à l\\'avenir. \\n[26] \\nGodard indique que son voisin a vendu sa propriété à Conrad Lamadeleine vers 1983. Peu \\naprès avoir acheté la propriété, M. Lamadeleine a construit un mur de soutènement au \\nmilieu de la ruelle Martin-Filion en utilisant de vieilles traverses de chemin de fer. M. \\nLamadeleine a fait d\\'autres modifications à l\\'arrière de la propriété en nivelant l\\'arrière de \\nla propriété et en l\\'élevant légèrement. M. Lamadeleine a ensuite construit une remise dans \\nl\\'espace de la ruelle et y a planté son potager. \\n[27] \\nM. Godard relève qu\\'il a remarqué qu\\'il y avait de nouvelles flaques d’eau à l\\'arrière de sa \\npropriété à la suite des travaux effectués par M. Lamadeleine. À ce moment-là, les élections \\nmunicipales de 1985 avaient eu lieu et M. Lamadeleine avait été élu maire de Casselman. \\n[28] \\nLe mur de soutènement construit par M. Lamadeleine est encore là aujourd\\'hui selon \\nGodard. Le cabanon construit par M. Lamadeleine a été remplacé par une nouvelle \\nstructure en 1992 qui est restée en place jusqu\\'à ce que la présente demande soit déposée. \\nLe propriétaire actuel du 13, rue Martin a choisi de se conformer à la demande de la \\nMunicipalité d\\'enlever toutes les structures de la ruelle Martin-Filion et a démoli le \\ncabanon. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n[29] \\nDe façon significative, Godard déclare qu\\'au cours de l\\'été 1986 - en juin ou juillet - il a vu \\nle maire Lamadeleine à l\\'extérieur de sa résidence. Godard a soulevé la question des flaques \\nd’eau créé par les travaux qu\\'il avait effectués à l\\'arrière de sa propriété et qui résultaient \\nde la dénivellation qu\\'il avait créées. Godard a demandé à M. Lamadeleine s’ils pouvaient \\nse rencontrer pour discuter d\\'une solution quelconque de la part de la Municipalité. \\n[30] \\nLe maire Lamadeleine a accepté et environ une semaine plus tard - à la fin de juin ou au \\ndébut de juillet 1986 - une réunion a eu lieu dans la cour arrière de l\\'intimée Godard pour \\ndiscuter de la dénivellation et de la question des flaques d’eau. Selon Godard, le maire \\nLamadeleine, le greffier de la Municipalité, Gilles Lortie, et la fille de Louis Godard, Sylvie \\nCléroux, étaient présents à cette réunion. Godard avait demandé à sa fille d\\'être présente \\nafin d\\'avoir un témoin pour la discussion. Mme Cléroux était âgée de 17 ans à l\\'époque. \\n[31] \\nSelon l\\'affidavit de l\\'intimé Godard : \\na. Le maire Lamadeleine a déclaré que la Municipalité n\\'avait pas les fonds \\nnécessaires pour remplir, drainer ou entretenir les terrains de la ruelle Martin-Filion.  \\nb. Le maire Lamadeleine a confirmé que la décision du Conseil précédent de ne pas \\nutiliser ou entretenir la ruelle demeure.  \\nc. Le Maire Lamadeleine a déclaré que la décision était que la ruelle devait être divisée \\négalement entre les propriétaires des terrains adjacents, chacun recevant environ 15 \\npieds de profondeur. Les propriétaires limitrophes devraient donc prendre le terrain \\nde la ruelle contestée et l\\'utiliser comme bon leur semblait. Par conséquent, tous les \\ntravaux nécessaires pour remédier à la formation des flaques d’eau sur la partie de \\nson terrain situé sur la ruelle seront à la charge de M. Godard. \\nd. À cette déclaration, M. Lortie a répondu que la ruelle avait été conçue pour fournir \\nde l\\'espace en vue de la construction future de raccordements d\\'égouts aux maisons \\ndes rues Martin et Filion, si ces services étaient un jour étendus à ce secteur de la \\nMunicipalité - bien qu\\'il n\\'y ait pas de plans immédiats à cet égard.  \\ne. M. Lortie a aussi informé le maire Lamadeleine que le conseil précédent avait \\nindiqué que si la Municipalité devait transférer de façon permanente la ruelle aux \\npropriétaires voisins, il serait sage d\\'acquérir une bande de terrain de 15 pieds de \\nlarge à l\\'avant des propriétés, sur les rues Martin et Filion, afin de réserver de \\nl\\'espace pour la construction de toute ligne d\\'égout future. \\nf. Le maire Lamadeleine a répondu que ce plan de prendre du terrain à l\\'avant des \\npropriétés n\\'était tout simplement pas faisable. Si la Municipalité prenait 15 pieds \\nde terrain à l\\'avant, l\\'avant de la propriété ne pourrait pas être utilisé pour la \\nconstruction d\\'une ligne d\\'égout. \\ng. Le maire Lamadeleine a alors demandé à M. Lortie que la Municipalité transfère \\nsimplement le terrain aux propriétaires riverains des deux rues. Le maire \\nLamadeleine a déclaré qu\\'à son avis, le transfert du terrain que la Municipalité \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nn\\'utilisera jamais, ainsi que toute responsabilité pour son entretien, épargnerait de \\nl\\'argent à la Municipalité à long terme. \\nh. M. Lortie a répondu que la Municipalité ne pouvait pas simplement donner le \\nterrain. Il faut que le transfert se fasse correctement. Il y a des formalités à remplir \\net le transfert doit être inscrit dans les registres de la Municipalité comme une vente \\nd\\'actifs. \\ni. À cette déclaration, le maire Lamadeleine a répondu que, dans ce cas, pour régler \\nl\\'affaire une fois pour toutes, la Municipalité devrait procéder au transfert de 15 \\npieds de la ruelle et indiquer, dans les registres de la Municipalité, que le terrain a \\nété vendu pour 1 $.  \\nj. Le maire Lamadeleine a alors déclaré, sans équivoque que la moitié de la ruelle \\nétait le terrain de l\\'intimé Godard. Il pouvait régler le problème des flaques d’eau \\nlui-même et faire ce qu\\'il voulait avec le terrain. Le maire Lamadeleine a indiqué \\nque la Municipalité s\\'occuperait des formalités de transferts de propriétés. \\n[32] \\nL\\'affidavit de l\\'intimé déclare que l\\'intimé a adopté les comportements suivants sur la base \\nde l\\'accord de transfert des terrains de la ruelle : \\na. L\\'intimé Godard a modifié le niveau de la ruelle attenante sa propriété afin qu\\'elle \\nsoit au même niveau que le mur de soutènement de M. Lamadeleine. \\nb. L\\'intimé Godard et sa famille ont continué à utiliser la ruelle comme ils le faisaient \\nauparavant. Ils l\\'ont utilisée comme stationnement, pour cultiver des légumes, pour \\nélever des poulets dans la structure déjà construite. \\n[33] \\nGodard affirme que depuis qu\\'il est propriétaire de la propriété du 15, rue Martin, la \\nMunicipalité n\\'a jamais accédé à la ruelle litigieuse ni ne l\\'a utilisée ou entretenue. \\n[34] \\nL\\'affidavit de Godard n\\'aborde pas la question de la date du transfert allégué de la partie \\ncontestée de la ruelle. \\n[35] \\nAu cours de son contre-interrogatoire, M. Godard a confirmé qu’il n’avait reçu aucune \\ndocumentation suite à la réunion de l’été 1986, malgré son attente de recevoir de tels \\ndocuments. M. Godard n\\'a pas assuré le suivi de cette documentation auprès de la \\nMunicipalité. \\n[36] \\nTel que noté ci-dessus, l\\'affidavit de M. Godard indique que le maire Lamadeleine avait \\nproposé d\\'impliquer tous les résidents dont la propriété est contiguë à la ruelle contestée.  \\nL\\'affidavit indique également que l\\'entente alléguée ne concernait que l\\'intimé Godard. \\n[37] \\nLe contre-interrogatoire de l\\'intimé Godard établit qu\\'il n\\'avait pas de bonnes relations avec \\nle maire Lamadeleine, mais que M. Lortie, le greffier de la Municipalité, était digne de \\nconfiance. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\n[38] \\nLe contre-interrogatoire de Godard révèle également qu\\'en avril 2023, à la suite d\\'une \\ntempête de verglas, il a communiqué avec la Municipalité pour lui demander de dégager \\nles branches tombées au fur et à mesure qu\\'elles provenaient de la ruelle : \\nQ. Donc, moi, ce que j’essaie de comprendre, à moins que je me trompe, j’ai \\nl’impression qu’au mois d’avril 2023, il y a eu une grosse tempête… […] et il y a \\nun arbre qui est tombé sur votre « shed ». \\nR. Oui, Monsieur. […] \\nQ. Et l’arbre était situé dans la Ruelle. \\nR. Oui, en arrière de la « shed » où est-ce que Lamadeleine restait. […] \\nQ. […] vous ou votre fille, vous avez communiqué avec la Municipalité de \\nCasselman. \\nR. Oui. \\nQ. Vous avez demandé à la Municipalité de Casselman de prendre des démarches \\npour enlever les \\nbranches et enlever l’arbre qui a causé des dommages à votre « shed ». \\nR. Oui. Puis réparer la « shed ». \\nQ. Parce que ça, c’était leur faute que ça avait eu lieu. \\nR. Oui. \\nQ. Parce que c’était l’arbre qui était dans la Ruelle qui avait causé ça. \\nR. Oui, Monsieur. […] \\nQ. Votre fille, elle a écrit à la Municipalité pour leur dire ça ? \\nR. Oui, oui, elle a demandé à la Municipalité d’enlever ça. \\n \\n[39] \\nLe contre-interrogatoire établit l\\'utilisation habituelle de la ruelle par l\\'intimé avant l\\'accord \\nrevendiqué de 1986 de la façon suivante : \\na. M. Godard a confirmé qu’il utilisait un petit cabanon situé dans la ruelle pour élever \\ndes chapons et ensuite des lapins en 1978. \\nQ. Okay. Moi je comprends, quand vous parlez dans votre affidavit, que \\nvous avez élevé des chapons. \\nR. Dans ce temps-là, oui. \\nQ. Oui. \\nR. Ça fait longtemps passé. \\nQ. Oui, oui. Dans votre affidavit, vous dites que vous avez commencé ça en \\n1978. \\nR. À peu près, oui. […] \\nQ. Parfait. Après ces trois ou quatre ans-là, est-ce que vous avez \\nélevé d’autres types d’animaux que des chapons ? \\nR. Oui, il y avait deux ou trois petits lapins. \\n \\nb. M. Godard a également confirmé stationner dans la ruelle son « camper » environ \\nen 1980. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nQ. Okay. Là, à un certain point, je pense, vous avez fait un stationnement \\ndans la Ruelle. […] \\n \\nR. Mais oui, j’en ai un comme c’est là. \\nQ. Oui, mais vous l’aviez ça fait longtemps ça aussi ? \\nR. Oui. \\nQ. C’est à peu près quelle année que vous avez commencé à vous \\nstationner dans la ruelle avec votre \\nauto ? […] \\nR. Dans ce temps-là, c’était un « camper » que j’avais. […] \\nQ. Il était dans la Ruelle ? \\nR. Oui, je le « parkais » là. Soit là ou, des fois, dans le jardin chez nous. \\nQ. C’était environ quelle année que vous avez mis le « camper » là ? \\nR. Le « camper », je dirais à peu près alentour de ’80. \\n \\nLa preuve présentée par Sylvie Cléroux \\n[40] \\nSylvie Cléroux est la deuxième des deux intimés restants. Elle a fourni un affidavit et a été \\ncontre-interrogée par l\\'avocat de la requérante. Elle est la fille de Louis Godard. \\n[41] \\nElle est copropriétaire du lot 9 de la rue Martin, dont l\\'adresse civique est le 7 de la rue \\nMartin dans la Municipalité de Casselman. Elle a acheté la propriété avec son conjoint en \\n1992. \\n[42] \\nDans son affidavit, l\\'intimée Cléroux déclare :  \\n“When I purchased 7 Martin Street, the rear property line between my property and \\nmy neighbour to the rear at 22 Filion Street was physically located in approximately \\nthe middle of the disputed laneway lands located between Martin and Filion Streets \\nthat are the subject of this Application (the Martin-Filion Laneway). The physical \\ndemarcation between our properties consisted of a fence that had been erected by a \\nprevious owner approximately in the middle of the Martin-Filion laneway, as well \\nas a mature cedar hedge at the rear of 22 Filion Street. In addition, various plants, \\nshrubs, and mature trees were present along the length of the rear property line, and \\na shed had also been built on my half of the Martin-Filion Laneway.” \\n[43] \\nElle déclare qu\\'elle a assisté à une réunion concernant la ruelle qui, selon elle, a eu lieu à \\nla fin juin ou au début juillet 1986. Elle déclare que son père lui a demandé d\\'assister à la \\nréunion parce qu\\'il voulait s\\'assurer qu\\'il y aurait un témoin de ce qui serait dit. Le nouveau \\nmaire, Conrad Lamadeleine, et Giles Lortie, le secrétaire de la Municipalité, étaient \\nprésents à la réunion. \\n[44] \\nElle déclare qu\\'il s\\'est passé ce qui suit lors de la réunion après que les quatre ont visité la \\npropriété de son père : \\na. Le maire Lamadeleine a reconnu qu\\'il était au courant des problèmes de drainage \\ndans le secteur de la ruelle. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nb. Son père, l\\'intimé, a demandé au maire Lamadeleine si la Municipalité pouvait faire \\nquelque chose au sujet du drainage. Le maire Lamadeleine a répondu que la \\nMunicipalité n\\'avait pas les fonds nécessaires pour entretenir les terrains de la \\nruelle. Il a déclaré que la décision du conseil municipal précédent de ne pas utiliser \\nou entretenir la ruelle était toujours en place et que la ruelle devrait être divisée \\négalement entre les propriétaires des terrains adjacents, chacun recevant environ 15 \\npieds. \\nc. En réponse au commentaire du maire, M. Lortie a indiqué que la ruelle avait été \\nétablie pour permettre la construction future de raccordements d\\'égouts aux \\nmaisons des rues Martin et Filion - au cas où ces services seraient un jour étendus \\nà ce secteur de la municipalité. M. Lortie a ajouté que le conseil précédent avait \\nindiqué que si la Municipalité devait transférer de façon permanente la ruelle aux \\npropriétaires riverains, elle ne devrait le faire que si elle pouvait obtenir une bande \\nde terrain de 15 pieds de large à l\\'avant des propriétés, sur les rues Martin et Filion, \\nafin qu\\'il y ait de l\\'espace pour construire toute future conduite d\\'égout. \\nd. Le maire Lamadeleine a répondu que cela n\\'avait pas de sens parce que certaines \\nmaisons ont été construites assez près de la rue pour que leur porte d’entrée donne \\ndirectement dans la chaussée. Le maire Lamadeleine a alors dit à M. Lortie de \\nsimplement transférer le terrain aux propriétaires riverains des rues Martin et Filion. \\nCeci permettrait à la Municipalité d\\'économiser de l\\'argent à long terme. \\ne. M. Lortie a répondu que la Municipalité ne pouvait pas donner des terrains. Le \\nmaire Lamadeleine a répondu : \"Fait juste écrire aux livres qu\\'on a vendu le 30 \\npieds, 15 pieds à parts égales, pour 1 $\" ou quelque chose de très proche de ces \\nmots. \\nf. Le maire Lamadeleine a alors dit clairement que la moitié de la ruelle était la terre \\nde son père et qu\\'il pouvait en faire ce qu\\'il voulait. Le maire Lamadeleine a dit que \\nla Municipalité s\\'occuperait des formalités, mais que son père devait régler lui-\\nmême le problème de drainage sur son terrain. \\n[45] \\nL\\'intimée Cléroux affirme que son père a par la suite commandé et payé des travaux de \\nremblai pour régler le problème de drainage. \\n[46] \\nDans son affidavit, l\\'intimée Cléroux cite plusieurs façons dont la Municipalité l\\'a traitée \\ncomme la propriétaire légitime de la moitié de la ruelle Martin-Filion. Je ne les répéterai \\npas ici. Elles se trouvent aux paragraphes dix-huit à trente de son affidavit. \\n[47] \\nL\\'affidavit de l\\'intimée Cléroux n\\'aborde pas la question du moment du transfert de la \\npropriété litigieuse. Il est silencieux sur cette question. \\n[48] \\nL’intimée Cléroux a confirmé en 2023 qu’elle s’attendait à ce que son père reçoive des \\ndocuments après la rencontre en 1986. Cependant, aucun document n’a été envoyé et \\naucune demande n’a été faite de façon contemporaine auprès de la Municipalité afin \\nd’obtenir la documentation attendue : \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n \\nQ. Okay. D’accord. Est-ce que j’ai raison de comprendre que ce que les personnes \\ns’attendaient suite à \\ncette rencontre-là c’est qu’il y aurait du « paperwork » qui devait être préparé ? \\nR. C’était sous-entendu, mais c’est jamais arrivé. […] \\nQ. […] est-ce que j’ai raison de croire que, à la lumière de cette rencontre-là, vous \\nvous attendiez à ce \\nqu’il y ait des papiers qui soient envoyés, en tout cas à votre père ? \\nR. Oui, c’est ça. \\nQ. […] il n’y en a pas eu de ces papiers-là qui ont été envoyés à votre père ? \\nR. Exactement, il n’y a jamais eu de papiers. […] \\nQ. Vous n’avez jamais demandé à la Municipalité pour avoir le « paperwork » relié \\nà la rencontre de 1986. \\nR. Non. \\nQ. Puis à votre connaissance, votre père non plus a pas fait cette demande-là ? \\nR. Non \\n \\n[49] \\nComme mentionné plus haut, l\\'intimée Cléroux se rappelle que lors de la conversation où \\nle contrat allégué a été créé, le maire a inclus tous les résidents des rues Martin et Filion \\ndans l\\'entente. En contre-interrogatoire, l\\'intimée Cléroux laisse entendre que seuls les deux \\nintimés et Mme Durocher étaient parties à l\\'entente verbale ou au contrat. \\n[50] \\nL\\'intimée Cléroux avait dix-sept ans au moment de la création de l\\'entente verbale alléguée. \\nElle n\\'étant pas propriétaire de cette rue avant 1992, elle n’est donc pas partie à l\\'accord \\noral présumé de 1986. Lors du contre-interrogatoire de son affidavit, les questions \\nsuivantes lui ont été posées et elle a fourni les réponses suivantes : \\nQ. À ce moment-là, quand il y a eu la rencontre en 1986, vous, vous n’étiez pas \\npropriétaire d’un terrain à Casselman. \\nR. Non. \\nQ. Vous n’étiez pas propriétaire d’un terrain sur la rue Martin ou la rue Filion. \\nR. Non. […]Q. Je comprends. Donc, si vous dites que la rencontre était là pour \\ntraiter de questions relatives à la \\nruelle, vous n’étiez pas là parce que vous étiez propriétaire affectée par la ruelle. \\nR. Non, c’est ça. […] \\nQ. Puis il n’y a pas eu de promesse qui pouvait vous être faite à vous jusqu’en ’92 \\nparce que vous n’aviez \\npas de maison. \\nR. Il y a pas de promesse qui pouvait être faite à moi. \\n \\n[51] \\nLors de son contre-interrogatoire, Mme Cléroux a précisé que lors de la rencontre de 1986, \\nM. Lortie avait mentionné qu’il n’était pas possible d’échanger les 15 pieds à l’arrière pour \\nles 15 pieds à l’avant, car certaines maisons se situaient à l’intérieur des limites des 15 \\npieds à l’avant du terrain : \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nR. Oui. À la rencontre avec Conrad puis monsieur Lortie -- je m’excuse, monsieur \\nLamadeleine et monsieur Lortie -- Conrad a dit à monsieur Lortie : « Ils peuvent \\nprendre le 15 pieds en arrière. Donne leur \\nle 15 pieds en arrière pour une piastres. Parce que si jamais on a besoin, on peut le \\nprendre en avant. » Monsieur Lortie a dit ça à Conrad. Puis Conrad, lui, a fait \\nréponse à monsieur Lortie : « On peut pas, il y a des maisons qui sont bâties trop \\nproche de la rue ». Ma maison sur la rue Martin, si tu prends \\n15 pieds en avant, tu es rendu dans ma porte d’entrée quasiment. […] \\nR. On savait que c’était impossible que jamais, sur Martin -- je parle pas de Filion \\n-- sur Martin, il pourrait jamais prendre le 15 pieds en avant. […] \\nQ. Mais ma question était : est-ce 15 qu’il y a quelqu’un qui vous a jamais demandé, \\nà vous ou à votre père, pour le 15 pieds en avant de la maison ? Ce que vous dites \\nc’est que c’est jamais arrivé. \\nR. Non, ils m’ont pas demandé de prendre 15 pieds en avant. \\nQ. Vous, à votre connaissance, et ils n’ont jamais demandé à votre père non plus. \\nR. Pas à ma connaissance. \\n[52] \\nEn contre-interrogatoire, l\\'intimée Cléroux a confirmé que lorsqu\\'elle a acheté sa propriété \\nde la rue Martin en 1992, ses avocats en droit immobilier ont refusé de préparer la \\ndocumentation qui reflétait qu’elle était propriétaire du terrain de la ruelle attenant à sa \\npropriété. \\n[53] \\nComme indiqué ci-dessus, Mme Cléroux a acheté sa propriété de la rue Martin en 1992. \\nDe plus, lors du contre-interrogatoire, elle a confirmé cela et a ajouté qu’elle n’était pas \\npartie à la prétendue entente orale de 1986. \\nQ. À ce moment-là, quand il y a eu la rencontre en 1986, vous, vous n’étiez pas \\npropriétaire d’un terrain à Casselman. \\nR. Non. \\nQ. Vous n’étiez pas propriétaire d’un terrain sur la rue Martin ou la rue Filion. \\nR. Non. […] \\nQ. Je comprends. Donc, si vous dites que la rencontre était là pour traiter de \\nquestions relatives à la ruelle, vous n’étiez pas là parce que vous étiez propriétaire \\naffectée par la ruelle. \\nR. Non, c’est ça. […] \\nQ. Puis il n’y a pas eu de promesse qui pouvait vous être faite à vous jusqu’en ’92 \\nparce que vous n’aviez pas de maison. \\n \\nR. Il y a pas de promesse qui pouvait être faite à moi.  \\n[54] \\nMme Cléroux a également confirmé lors de son contre-interrogatoire que la Municipalité \\nn’a fait aucune promesse à son égard après 1992, c’est-à-dire après qu’elle soit devenue \\npropriétaire d’un bienfonds situé sur la rue Martin. Bien que Mme Cléroux mentionne avoir \\nfait des demandes auprès de la Municipalité pour faire reconnaître ses allégations, elle \\nconfirme qu’aucune promesse ne lui a été faite à partir du moment où elle est devenue \\npropriétaire. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\n[55] \\nL\\'intimée Cléroux décrit l\\'utilisation de la ruelle par ses parents et sa famille avant la \\nrencontre de 1986. Elle précise qu\\'elle servait notamment à stationner divers véhicules et \\nqu\\'elle permettait d\\'accéder à un jardin situé sur une propriété de la rue Filion. Elle se \\nsouvient que son père coupait l\\'herbe dans la ruelle. \\nLa preuve présentée par Christine Durocher \\n[56] \\nMme Durocher a acheté le lot 15, connu sous le nom municipal de 1, rue Martin, Casselman \\n(Ontario) en octobre 2000. \\n[57] \\nElle a résidé à cet endroit jusqu\\'au 29 août 2008. \\n[58] \\nSon affidavit a été déposé dans le cadre des documents des intimés en réponse à la requête. \\nElle a été contre-interrogée à propos de cet affidavit. \\n[59] \\nBien qu\\'il ne soit pas recevable pour la véracité de son contenu, elle constate dans son \\naffidavit qu’au moment d’acheter la propriété, soit l’agent immobilier, soit le vendeur lui \\nont affirmé verbalement que la Municipalité de Casselman avait cédé la ruelle située à \\nl’arrière de la propriété en parts égales aux propriétaires des rues Martin et Filion. Ils lui ont \\naussi déclaré que si la Municipalité avait, un jour, besoin de terrain pour des fins \\nmunicipales, elle prendrait une bande équivalente de 15 pieds de largeur à l’avant des \\npropriétés. \\n[60] \\nElle précise que comme les documents pour l’achat de la propriété ne reflétaient pas cette \\npromesse de manière explicite, elle a cru bon de se renseigner auprès de la Municipalité \\navant de conclure l’achat. \\n[61] \\nMme Durocher affirme dans son affidavit qu’elle a demandé à M. Lortie si ce qu’on lui \\navait dit était vrai, plus spécifiquement si la ruelle entre les rues Martin et Filion avait été \\ndonnée aux propriétaires et que, en cas de besoin, la Municipalité prendrait une partie \\néquivalente de son terrain à l’avant. M. Lortie lui a répondu qu’une promesse verbale avait \\nété faite à cet effet. Elle lui a demandé si elle pouvait obtenir un document de la part de la \\nMunicipalité pour confirmer que c’était bien le cas. M. Lortie a répété qu’il s’agissait d’une \\npromesse verbale et que, par conséquent, il ne pouvait pas lui donner un document pour \\nconfirmer la décision. \\n[62] \\nMme Durocher affirme qu\\'elle s\\'est fiée à la déclaration de M. Lortie et qu\\'elle n\\'a pas \\ninsisté pour obtenir une confirmation écrite, d\\'autant plus qu\\'elle n\\'avait pas le choix. Elle \\nn\\'avait pas les moyens financiers de recourir aux services d\\'un avocat pour poursuivre \\nl\\'affaire. Elle maintient que c\\'est sur la foi de la promesse de M. Lortie qu\\'elle a conclu \\nl\\'achat de la propriété. Elle a entretenu la ruelle conformément à la conduite de ses voisins. \\nElle a fait remarquer qu\\'elle n\\'avait jamais vu la Municipalité entretenir la ruelle.  \\n[63] \\nL\\'affidavit de Mme Durocher n\\'aborde pas la date du prétendu transfert de propriété établi \\ndans un accord quelconque. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\n[64] \\nContrairement à la preuve présentée par les intimés, Mme Durocher affirme que la ruelle \\nn\\'a pas été vendue moyennant une contrepartie financière, mais qu\\'elle a plutôt été donnée \\naux résidents et que, le cas échéant, la Municipalité prendrait une portion équivalente de \\nson terrain à l\\'avant. \\n[65] \\nMme Durocher a reconnu en contre-interrogatoire qu\\'elle entretient une relation étroite \\navec les intimés. En contre-interrogatoire, elle a précisé qu’elle se rend chez M. Godard \\ntoutes les deux semaines depuis au moins trois ans pour prendre un café pendant environ \\ndeux heures de temps. Lors de ces rencontres, elle a affirmé qu’ils discutent parfois de la \\nruelle. \\n[66] \\nMme Durocher, en contre-interrogatoire, a laissé entendre qu\\'elle était partie au prétendu \\naccord oral bien qu\\'elle n\\'ait pas été présente à la réunion de juin ou juillet 1986.  \\n[67] \\nLors de son contre-interrogatoire, Mme Durocher a reconnu l’importance de l’écrit par \\nrapport à l’oral et, malgré cela, n’a jamais entrepris de démarche auprès de ses avocats pour \\nobtenir un document de la Municipalité. \\n[68] \\nMme Durocher n’était pas informée de la prétendue vente de la ruelle en 1986 aux intimés \\navant l’achat de sa propriété en 2000. Lors de son contre-interrogatoire, Mme Durocher a \\nconfirmé qu’elle a pris connaissance de la situation concernant la ruelle après l’achat de la \\npropriété. L’action d’achat de la propriété a été effectuée indépendamment d’une prétendue \\ncession de la ruelle en 1986. \\n[69] \\nLors de son contre-interrogatoire, Mme Durocher a confirmé qu’elle n’a jamais demandé \\nà son avocat de confirmer que la propriété de la ruelle avait été transférée de la Municipalité \\naux résidents. Elle ne se souvient plus si elle a bénéficié de l\\'assistance d\\'un avocat pour la \\npropriété de la rue Martin, car c\\'était il y a longtemps. \\nLa preuve présentée par Yves Morrissette \\n[70] \\nYves Morrissette est le directeur général de la Municipalité de Casselman. \\n[71] \\nLa requérante a déposé l\\'affidavit de M. Morrissette à l\\'appui la requête formulée par la \\nMunicipalité. Il a été contre-interrogé sur son affidavit. \\n[72] \\nIl a fourni des renseignements généraux concernant la ruelle contestée et le fonctionnement \\nde la Municipalité de Casselman. Son affidavit établit notamment ce qui suit : \\na. À sa connaissance et à partir des discussions qu’il a eues avec le personnel de la \\nMunicipalité, le Conseil municipal de la Municipalité de Casselman n’a pris aucune \\nmesure pour se départir de la propriété de la ruelle Martin-Filion. Aucune résolution \\nni règlement municipal n’a été adopté par le Conseil municipal pour se départir de \\nla ruelle Martin-Filion. Il n’a jamais été question de vendre la ruelle Martin-Filion \\naux résidents des rues Martin et Filion pour un montant symbolique de 1 $. À ce \\njour, la ruelle est toujours la propriété de la Municipalité de Casselman. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nb. Un membre individuel du conseil municipal n’avait pas et n’a pas le pouvoir de \\ncéder la propriété d’un terrain appartenant à la Municipalité. Pour qu’une \\ntransaction de cette nature puisse avoir lieu, le conseil municipal doive voter en \\nfaveur d’une résolution ou d’un règlement municipal spécifique. L’autorité de \\ncéder un terrain appartenant à la Municipalité de Casselman repose sur le conseil \\nmunicipal. \\nc. Il lui semble que la Municipalité a utilisé des règlements administratifs individuels \\npour chaque terrain vendu au cours des années 70, 80, 90 et 2000. \\nd. En 2018, un règlement administratif général concernant l’acquisition et la vente de \\nterrains a été créé, connu sous le nom de Règlement administratif municipal 2018-\\n040. Au terme du Règlement administratif municipal 2018-040, la Municipalité n’a \\naucune obligation de vendre ses biens-fonds aux propriétaires attenants. \\ne. À sa connaissance et à partir des discussions qu’il a eues avec le personnel de la \\nMunicipalité, il n’y a eu aucune entente verbale en ce qui concerne la vente de la \\nruelle Martin-Filion. Toute vente ou transaction de biens-fonds doit être effectuée \\nconformément aux procédures de la Municipalité de Casselman. Une entente \\nverbale serait contraire aux procédures de la Municipalité de Casselman. \\n[73] \\nEn ce qui concerne la ruelle Martin-Filion, il fournit les preuves suivantes : \\na. La Municipalité de Casselman compte plusieurs ruelles, la plupart étant recouvertes \\nde végétation plutôt que d’asphalte ou de béton. Ces ruelles sont généralement \\naménagées avec de petits fossés afin de faciliter l’absorption et l’écoulement des \\neaux pluviales. Elles constituent des terrains stratégiques pour la Municipalité, \\noffrant de multiples possibilités d’aménagement. Par exemple, elles peuvent être \\nutilisées pour créer des infrastructures récréatives, établir des jardins \\ncommunautaires ou encore implanter des services publics. \\nb. La Municipalité de Casselman a toléré que les résidents utilisent la ruelle Martin-\\nFilion à des fins communautaires, incluant des activités de loisirs comme le sport \\net le jardinage. Cependant, la Municipalité a toujours veillé à ce que le nivellement \\nde la ruelle ne soit pas modifié, afin de garantir un bon écoulement des eaux \\npluviales. Bien que les résidents aient pu profiter de la ruelle pour diverses activités \\ncommunautaires et personnelles, ils n’ont jamais été autorisés à modifier sa \\nconfiguration. \\nc. La Municipalité de Casselman a toléré la présence de certains biens dans la ruelle, \\npour autant que ces biens n’affectaient pas le contrôle des eaux pluviales. Par \\nexemple, la Municipalité a toléré la présence dans la ruelle d’arbres, d’arbustes, de \\nclôtures en bois et de petits cabanons amovibles. Cette utilisation de la ruelle était \\nconforme à l’utilisation généralement faite d’une ruelle en milieu rural, et n’avait \\naucun impact sur la gestion des eaux pluviales. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\nd. Malgré l’utilisation communautaire de la ruelle Martin-Filion, les résidents étaient \\nau courant que la ruelle Martin-Filion appartenait à la Municipalité de Casselman. \\nEn aucun temps, la Municipalité n’a laissé entendre aux propriétaires des terrains \\nattenants à la ruelle Martin-Filion qu’ils pouvaient utiliser celle-ci comme s’il \\ns’agissait de leur propriété privée. Les résidents étaient conscients que la ruelle \\nMartin-Filion appartenait à la Municipalité et que bien qu’ils puissent l’utiliser de \\nmanière communautaire, cette portion de terrain ne leur appartenait pas. \\ne. La Municipalité de Casselman a toujours eu un accès ininterrompu à chaque \\nparcelle de terrain qui compose la ruelle. En tant que propriétaire de la ruelle \\nMartin-Filion, la Municipalité de Casselman a toujours exercé son droit d’accéder \\nà ces terrains sans nécessiter une autorisation préalable des propriétaires des terrains \\nattenants à la ruelle Martin-Filion.  \\nf. À sa connaissance et à partir des discussions qu’il a eues avec le personnel de la \\nMunicipalité, la Municipalité a surveillé l’utilisation de la ruelle Martin-Filion et, \\ndès que son utilisation était contraire à l’utilisation normale d’une ruelle, des \\ndémarches étaient prises pour demander aux résidents de remédier à la situation. \\nIl a été informé par le personnel municipal actuel et ancien que, en général, les \\nrésidents ont respecté l’utilisation normale de la ruelle. La Municipalité n’a dû \\nintervenir que très rarement. En général, la Municipalité est intervenue lorsque \\nl’utilisation de la ruelle avait un impact sur la gestion des eaux pluviales ou \\nperturbait la jouissance de la ruelle par les autres résidents. \\n  \\ng. La position de la Municipalité a toujours été que les résidents qui utilisaient la \\nruelle d’une manière incompatible avec son usage normal devaient \\npersonnellement assumer les coûts et les responsabilités liés à la correction de la \\nsituation qu’ils avaient créée. À sa connaissance et à partir des discussions qu’il \\navait eues avec le personnel de la Municipalité, lorsque les résidents modifiaient \\nla conception de la ruelle, la Municipalité exigeait qu’ils corrigent la situation et \\nremettent la ruelle dans son état d’origine. \\n \\n[74] \\nL\\'affidavit décrit l\\'utilisation des terrains appartenant à la Municipalité en tant que réserves \\nroutières et système de drainage ainsi que l’importance de ces terrains pour les \\ndéveloppements résidentiels. Sur ce dernier point, l\\'affidavit indique que : \\na. La ruelle Martin-Filion a suscité un intérêt constant de la part des conseillers \\nmunicipaux au fil des années, en raison de son emplacement stratégique à proximité \\nde terrains qui allaient servir à des développements résidentiels, maintenant \\nconnues sous les noms de projet Cassel Homelands et de projet Domaine de la \\nrivière Nation. Les différentes administrations municipales ont discuté des diverses \\npossibilités d’utilisation de cette ruelle. Les conseillers ont reconnu le potentiel de \\nla ruelle en tant que ressource importante pour répondre aux besoins du quartier en \\nexpansion. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\nb. Le projet Cassel Homelands est un développement résidentiel composé de maisons \\nunifamiliales et semi-détachées sur un terrain situé au sud du chemin Principale et \\nà l’ouest du chemin Laflèche. Le projet est divisé en trois phases et comprend \\nenviron 200 unités résidentielles. Le Conseil municipal a approuvé une entente de \\nsubdivision pour le développement de la phase 1 en juillet 2021. \\nc. Le projet Domaine de la rivière Nation est un développement résidentiel, situé au \\nsud de la rue Martin, et comprend actuellement plus de 170 unités résidentielles \\ncomposées de maisons unifamiliales, semi-détachées et maisons de ville. Ce \\ndéveloppement résidentiel revêt une grande importance pour la Municipalité de \\nCasselman, car il représente des changements majeurs dans le développement et \\nl’utilisation des services publics. Le projet est toujours en cours de développement, \\net il est prévu d’ajouter plus de 290 autres unités résidentielles. \\nd. La ruelle Martin-Filion est située tout juste au nord du Domaine de la rivière Nation \\net à l’est du projet Cassel Homelands. Les conseils municipaux ont toujours voulu \\npréserver la ruelle Martin-Filion pour répondre aux besoins croissants du secteur. \\nBien que certains services publics soient déjà présents sous les rues Martin et Filion, \\nil est tout à fait concevable qu’il devienne nécessaire de localiser d’autres types de \\nservices publics dans la ruelle pour répondre à la demande croissante de services \\nliés au secteur. \\n[75] \\nEnfin, l’affidavit expose les événements qui ont conduit à l\\'introduction de cette demande: \\na. En 2018, la Municipalité de Casselman a mené un sondage auprès des propriétaires \\npour connaître leur avis sur le nettoyage de la ruelle et les travaux de nivellement \\nvisant à faciliter l’écoulement des eaux. Sur les dix-neuf propriétaires interrogés, \\ndouze ont exprimé leur soutien à ces travaux, tandis que cinq s’y sont opposés. \\nDeux propriétaires n’ont pas donné suite à cette demande. \\nb. En septembre 2019, un avis municipal aux résidents des rues Martin et Filion a été \\nenvoyé afin d’aviser les résidents de l’intention de la Municipalité d’effectuer des \\ntravaux de nettoyage et de nivellement dans la ruelle. Ces travaux d’entretien \\nétaient devenus nécessaires afin que la ruelle puisse maintenir sa conception \\noriginelle qui permet aux eaux de s’écouler. \\nc. Cependant, certains résidents ont exprimé leur refus d’adhérer à la directive de \\nnettoyage émise par la Municipalité tandis que d\\'autres ont refusé de reconnaître la \\npropriété de la ruelle par la Municipalité. Une évaluation a été menée pour \\ndéterminer les biens personnels qui se trouvaient dans la ruelle Martin-Filion et \\nobtenir des informations sur les intentions des résidents. \\nd. En raison des objections de certains résidents concernant la proposition de la \\nMunicipalité de procéder aux travaux de nivellement et de retirer les biens situés \\ndans la ruelle, la Municipalité a déposé une requête devant la Cour supérieure. Tous \\nles propriétaires des lots situés sur la rue Martin et sur la rue Filion ont signé un \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\nconsentement pour l’émission du jugement joint à la requête introduite par la \\nMunicipalité le 30 novembre 2020, à l’exception des intimés Godard et Cléroux. \\nLa preuve présentée par Gilles Lortie \\n[76] \\nLa requérante soumet l\\'affidavit de Gilles Lortie. M. Lortie a été contre-interrogé sur son \\naffidavit. \\n[77] \\nLa Municipalité de Casselman a employé M. Lortie entre 1976 et 2013. Pendant plusieurs \\nannées, il a été le seul employé de l\\'hôtel de ville avec le secrétaire de la Municipalité. À \\nce titre, il a occupé plusieurs fonctions, dont celles de greffier et de trésorier. Il a été le \\nprincipal interlocuteur des citoyens lorsqu\\'ils se présentaient à l\\'hôtel de ville. Lorsque les \\ngens venaient à la ville pour un problème, c\\'est généralement lui qui s\\'adressait à eux. \\n[78] \\nLes gens s\\'adressaient également aux conseillers municipaux. Dans ce cas, les conseillers \\nmunicipaux le sollicitaient et lui demandaient d’inscrire cette question à l’ordre du jour de \\nla réunion du conseil municipal. \\n[79] \\nSelon M. Lortie, comme il est révélé dans les procès-verbaux de la Municipalité, les \\nplaintes reçues par la Municipalité étaient discutées par les membres du conseil lors des \\nréunions du conseil municipal. Les décisions prises par le conseil municipal à propos de \\nchaque plainte étaient également consignées dans les procès-verbaux. Les procès-verbaux \\nétaient très détaillés et chaque point y était consigné. \\n[80] \\nLes procès-verbaux des réunions tenues au cours de l’année 1986 ne mentionnent aucune \\nplainte en lien avec la ruelle Martin-Filion. Si un ou des résidents avaient fait des plaintes \\nrelativement à la ruelle Martin-Filion, ces plaintes auraient été discutées lors des réunions \\ndu conseil municipal. \\n[81] \\nAu cours de la réunion régulière du conseil tenue le 10 juin 1986, un dossier concernant le \\nfossé de la rue Filion, et non de la ruelle Martin-Filion, a été à l’ordre du jour. À cette \\nréunion, le conseil a étudié la demande de Wilfrid Sarault qui souhaitait creuser le fossé \\nsitué devant sa propriété sur la rue Filion. M. Sarault, qui avait entrepris la construction \\nd’une nouvelle résidence sur son terrain, avait creusé les fondations de sa résidence de \\nmanière trop profonde. Par conséquent, il envisageait d’approfondir le fossé situé en face \\nde son terrain afin de pallier cette situation. Néanmoins, le conseil municipal n’a pas jugé \\ncette solution appropriée et a donc décidé de ne pas accepter la demande de M. Sarault. \\n[82] \\nL\\'affidavit fait état d\\'autres activités du conseil municipal en rapport avec le voisinage de \\nla ruelle Martin-Filion : \\na. Le 12 août 1986, le conseil municipal a discuté et autorisé un permis de construction \\npour une nouvelle propriété sur la rue Martin. \\nb. Le 16 septembre 1986, le conseil municipal a discuté et autorisé un permis de \\nconstruction pour une nouvelle propriété sur la rue Filion. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\nc. Le 9 décembre 1986, le conseil a examiné une plainte relativement à une voiture \\nqui était stationnée dans la rue Martin. La voiture a été remorquée de la rue Martin. \\n[83] \\nSelon l’affidavit de M. Filion, aucune autre situation liée à la rue Martin, à la rue Filion ou \\nà la ruelle Martin-Filion n’a été discutée lors des réunions du conseil municipal en 1986, à \\nl’exception de ces quatre situations susmentionnées. \\n[84] \\nLa preuve de M. Lortie est que durant toutes les années où il a travaillé à la Municipalité, \\nla règle était que le conseil municipal était le seul à prendre les décisions. Il n’avait jamais \\nle pouvoir de décider au nom de la Municipalité. Toutes les décisions devaient être prises \\npar le conseil municipal, soit par règlement ou par résolution. Aucun membre du conseil, \\nni le maire ni un conseiller, n’avait le droit de décider au nom de la Municipalité. Les \\ndécisions étaient toujours du ressort du conseil municipal. \\n[85] \\nEn ce qui concerne la réunion de juin ou juillet 1986, l\\'affidavit de M. Lortie indique qu\\'il \\nne se souvient pas d\\'avoir discuté de la possibilité de transférer une partie de la ruelle \\nMartin-Filion. Il précise que ce n’était pas la pratique de la Municipalité de céder des \\nterrains après une simple rencontre informelle dans une cour arrière. La procédure à \\nl’époque, s’il y avait cession d’un terrain qui appartenait à la Municipalité, consistait à \\nobtenir l’autorisation du conseil municipal et à faire adopter un règlement par celui-ci, puis \\nà modifier les titres de propriété au bureau d’enregistrement à Russell. \\n[86] \\nM. Lortie a assisté aux réunions du conseil municipal. Il ne se souvient pas que le conseil \\nait discuté de la ruelle Martin-Filion. Il est possible que de telles discussions aient eu lieu, \\nmais il n\\'en a pas le souvenir. À cette époque, l\\'avocat de la Municipalité était Pierre \\nLamoureux. Il aurait été consulté si la Municipalité souhaitait céder des terres. Si le conseil \\navait donné des instructions en ce sens, il l\\'aurait consulté pour les démarches légales. \\nLa preuve présentée par Conrad Lamadeleine \\n[87] \\nLa requérante a déposé un affidavit de Conrad Lamadeleine. M. Lamadeleine a été contre-\\ninterrogé sur cet affidavit. \\n[88] \\nM. Lamadeleine a été élu maire de la Municipalité de Casselman en 1985 et a occupé cette \\nfonction pendant plus de vingt-cinq ans. \\n[89] \\nEn 1976, il a acheté le lot 3 de la rue Martin. L\\'adresse municipale est le 13 rue Martin. \\nSon voisin au sud est M. Godard au 15 de la rue Martin. Il a vendu cette propriété en 1982. \\n[90] \\nPendant les années où il a vécu sur la rue Martin, il connaissait l\\'existence de la ruelle et \\nsavait qu\\'elle appartenait à la Municipalité. Il nie avoir modifié la ruelle de façon \\npermanente. \\n[91] \\nPendant les années où il a résidé au 13 rue Martin, il a remarqué que certains résidents \\nutilisaient la ruelle Martin-Filion, qui appartient à la Municipalité de Casselman, \\nprincipalement pour des activités occasionnelles, telles que des loisirs ou du jardinage \\nsaisonnier. Les habitants des rues Martin et Filion étaient conscients que la ruelle \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\nappartenait à la Municipalité et n’ont jamais construit de structures permanentes dans celle-\\nci. Seules de petites structures mobiles et de la végétation ont été ajoutées à la ruelle. \\n[92] \\nEn tant que résident de la rue Martin, il n’a jamais reçu de demande de la Municipalité \\npour s’en occuper ou p o u r  entretenir la ruelle Martin-Filion. Certains de ses \\nvoisins ont coupé la végétation dans la ruelle afin de permettre l’utilisation de la \\nruelle pour des activités récréatives. D’autres résidents utilisaient la ruelle pour le \\njardinage. En somme, à sa connaissance, à aucun moment, la Municipalité n’a \\ndemandé aux résidents des rues Martin et Filion d’entretenir ou de prendre soin de \\nla ruelle Martin-Filion. Les résidents étaient conscients que cette partie du terrain \\nappartenait à la Municipalité. La Municipalité permettait aux résidents de faire usage \\nde la ruelle selon l’usage normal d’une ruelle. \\n[93] \\nIl a observé que la ville de Casselman est une petite municipalité située en région rurale, \\noù il est courant que les ruelles soient recouvertes de végétation. Contrairement aux \\nrégions métropolitaines où les ruelles sont souvent bétonnées ou asphaltées, il est \\nplutôt courant en région rurale que les ruelles soient composées de végétation. \\n[94] \\nM. Lamadeleine a construit un garage chez lui. Pour construire le garage, il était essentiel \\nque le sol soit parfaitement plat. Il a utilisé une pelle pour niveler le sol en vue de la \\nconstruction du garage. Aucune machinerie lourde ni aucun équipement industriel n’ont \\nété utilisés pour ce travail. Ce travail a été effectué entièrement sur sa propriété et non pas \\ndans la ruelle Martin-Filion. Par conséquent, il n’y a eu aucun impact sur le nivellement de \\nla ruelle Martin-Filion ou sur l’écoulement de l’eau de la ruelle Martin-Filion. De plus, les \\ninspections ont été faites par André Godard, l’inspecteur des bâtiments de la Municipalité \\nde l’époque, et tout était conforme. \\n[95] \\nSelon M. Lamadeleine, la ruelle derrière le 13 rue Martin est située plus bas que la ruelle \\nderrière le 15 rue Martin, l’eau s’écoule naturellement dans la ruelle du sud vers le nord, \\nen s’éloignant du 15 rue Martin. Par conséquent, il est impossible que le travail que il a \\nréalisé sur son lot ait eu pour effet de créer un problème d’accumulation d’eau dans la ruelle \\nou sur la propriété du 15 rue Martin. \\n[96] \\nEn ce qui concerne les terrains de l\\'intimé Godard, M. Lamadeleine a déclaré ce qui suit : \\na. Lorsque la maison de M. Godard a été construite avant 1975, celle-ci a été \\nconstruite de manière surélevée par rapport à l’ensemble du lot, et non seulement \\npar rapport à la ruelle. Cette pratique de construction était courante pour permettre \\nun écoulement approprié de l’eau. De cette manière, l’eau s’écoulait non pas vers \\nles maisons, mais vers les extrémités des terrains, permettant ainsi d’éviter \\nl’accumulation d’eau autour des fondations des maisons. \\nb. À un certain moment, il a remarqué que M. Godard avait ajouté des roches à \\nl’extrémité sud de la ruelle Martin-Filion. L’ajout des roches a permis à M. \\nGodard de stationner son véhicule dans la ruelle Martin-Filion à partir de la \\nrue Francess. Cependant, l’ajout de roches à l’extrémité de la ruelle par M. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\nGodard a eu pour effet de bloquer les ruisseaux de la ruelle Martin-Filion et \\nde la rue Francess. Cette altération des ruisseaux a eu pour effet de modifier \\nl’écoulement originelle de l’eau. M. Godard a donc installé un ponceau sous \\nle rocher pour tenter de rétablir l’écoulement originelle de l’eau. \\nc. La Municipalité de Casselman a informé M. Godard qu’il avait lui-même créé la \\nsituation d’accumulation d’eau dans la ruelle derrière sa propriété. En effet, M. \\nGodard a volontairement obstrué la ruelle, ce qui a entraîné un blocage empêchant \\nl’eau de s’écouler correctement. En outre, il a modifié la conception originelle de \\nla ruelle. La Municipalité a clairement expliqué à M. Godard qu’il était de sa \\nresponsabilité de remédier à la situation, étant donné qu’il était lui-même à l’origine \\nde cette situation. La conception originelle de la ruelle était adéquate pour permettre \\nl’écoulement approprié de l’eau. \\nd. En tant que voisin de M. Godard, il a rarement observé une accumulation d’eau \\ndans la ruelle située derrière sa propriété. Dans les rares cas où cela se produisait, \\nil s’agissait d’une accumulation mineure qui survenait uniquement après des \\nprécipitations exceptionnellement fortes ou lors de la fonte des neiges. Étant donné \\nque la ruelle n’était pas pavée, l’eau était absorbée par le sol et s’évaporait assez \\nrapidement, ce qui entraînait la disparition de l’accumulation d’eau.  \\ne. Il n’a jamais eu de problème d’accumulation d’eau sur son terrain. L’eau dans la \\nruelle Martin-Filion n’a jamais causé de risques d’inondation pour les terrains ou \\nles maisons. Elle restait toujours confinée dans la ruelle et ne débordait jamais. \\nf. L’eau s’écoulait naturellement de la ruelle Martin-Filion vers la rue Principale. \\nLorsque le terrain situé à l’extrémité de la ruelle a été vendu, un système souterrain \\na été installé pour permettre à l’eau de continuer à s’écouler de la ruelle vers les \\négouts de la rue Principale. Un système en forme de « T » a été installé à l’extrémité \\nnord de la ruelle. \\n[97] \\nEn ce qui concerne une rencontre entre lui et les intimés au cours de l\\'été 1986, M. \\nLamadeleine a déclaré ce qui suit : \\na. Il avait d’excellentes relations avec M. Godard. À plusieurs reprises, il a eu \\nl’occasion de discuter avec M. Godard au sujet de la ruelle Martin-Filion. Il a \\nexpliqué à M. Godard que la ruelle appartenait à la Municipalité et qu’il ne \\npouvait pas en faire un usage incompatible avec l’usage normal d’une ruelle. À \\nchacune de ces rencontres, M. Godard lui a expliqué qu’il comprenait que la \\nruelle appartenait à la Municipalité et qu’il ne pouvait pas faire usage de cette \\npartie du terrain comme s’il s’agissait de sa propriété. M. Godard était \\nconscient que cette partie de la propriété n’était pas à lui, mais appartenait \\nplutôt à la Municipalité de Casselman. \\nb. En juillet 1986, son voisin M. Godard lui a demandé de le rencontrer en tant que \\nmaire de la Municipalité de Casselman pour discuter de l’accumulation d’eau \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\ndans la ruelle. M. Lamadeleine a accepté de le rencontrer pour entendre ses \\npréoccupations. M. Lamadeleine a demandé au directeur général de la \\nMunicipalité, Gilles Lortie, de l’accompagner. La rencontre a eu lieu chez M. \\nGodard. Pendant la rencontre, M. Godard a expliqué qu’après de fortes pluies, \\nl’eau s’accumulait. Il a demandé ce que la Municipalité pouvait faire pour \\nrésoudre le problème. \\nc. À ce moment, M. Lamadeleine et M. Lortie ont informé M. Godard que \\nl’accumulation d’eau était causée par les roches qu’il avait ajoutées dans la \\nruelle Martin-Filion. Également, ils ont expliqué à que la conception de la \\nruelle était adéquate pour permettre l’écoulement de l’eau. En effet, la ruelle \\navait une légère pente du sud vers le nord, ce qui permettait l’écoulement \\nnaturel de l’eau, à l’exception du printemps avec les pluies et la fonte des neiges, \\nl’eau pouvait monter de deux pieds dans la ruelle, créant ainsi un danger pour \\nles enfants. \\nd. M. Godard a suggéré que la Municipalité draine la ruelle Martin-Filion. M. \\nLamadeleine a expliqué à M. Godard qu’une telle décision impliquait des coûts \\nfinanciers et nécessitait l’adoption d’une résolution par le Conseil municipal. Il a \\nexpliqué à M. Godard qu’en tant que maire, il n’avait pas l’autorité de prendre une \\ntelle décision de façon unilatérale. En général, lorsqu’il y avait des travaux à \\neffectuer, les employés ou fonctionnaires de la Municipalité informaient le Conseil, \\nqui ensuite votait sur une résolution en conséquence. Le département des travaux \\npublics de la Municipalité n’avait pas identifié de problème de nivellement ou \\nd’écoulement d’eau avec la ruelle Martin-Filion. \\ne. Pendant la rencontre, M. Godard a soulevé la question de savoir s’il était possible \\npour la Municipalité de céder la propriété de la ruelle aux propriétaires des \\ndifférents lots. Le directeur général de la Municipalité, M. Lortie, a expliqué que \\ncette décision nécessiterait des formalités écrites et une approbation formelle du \\nConseil municipal. De plus, M. Lortie a informé M. Godard que cette question avait \\ndéjà été discutée au sein du Conseil municipal et que le Conseil avait décidé de \\nconserver la propriété de la ruelle dans l’éventualité où il serait nécessaire de \\nl’utiliser pour faire passer des services publics vers des terrains situés plus au sud. \\nIl a également informé M. Godard qu’il y avait eu des discussions sur \\nl’élargissement du terrain dont la Municipalité est propriétaire à l’est des lots, mais \\nque la Municipalité avait décidé de maintenir le statu quo.  \\nf. M. Lamadeleine n’a jamais informé M. Godard que la Municipalité était \\nfavorable à une cession la ruelle de manière équitable entre les résidents. Cette \\ndécision nécessiterait l’approbation du Conseil municipal, et en tant que maire, \\nil n’avait pas le pouvoir de prendre une telle décision en vertu de la Loi sur les \\nmunicipalités de l’Ontario. À sa connaissance, le Conseil municipal de \\nCasselman n’a jamais envisagé de céder la propriété de la ruelle aux résidents. \\nLa Municipalité est restée propriétaire de la ruelle et a toujours eu l’intention de \\nconserver la propriété de celle-ci ainsi que des autres ruelles dans le secteur, au \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\ncas où leur utilisation serait nécessaire pour acheminer des services publics. M. \\nGodard avait été informé que ce genre de décision ne pouvait pas être prise \\ndans une cour arrière et nécessiterait des formalités et l’approbation du \\nConseil. Aucune promesse n’a été faite à M. Godard à l’effet qu’il \\ndeviendrait propriétaire d’une partie de la ruelle Martin-Filion. \\n[98] \\nM. Lamadeleine indique qu’il n’a jamais demandé à M. Lortie de transférer le titre de \\npropriété de la ruelle Martin-Filion. La Municipalité n’a jamais cédé de terrain aux \\nrésidents des rues Martin et Filion. Le Conseil avait exprimé son intention de conserver la \\npropriété de la ruelle au cas où elle serait nécessaire pour l’acheminement de services \\npublics. La Municipalité était également satisfaite de constater qu’il n’y avait pas de \\nproblème d’écoulement d’eau dans la ruelle et que celle-ci était en bon état, ne nécessitant \\naucun travail à ce moment-là. \\n[99] \\nLorsqu\\'il était maire de Casselman, il a toujours maintenu l\\'intention d\\'utiliser la ruelle pour \\nfaire passer le système d’égouts de la Municipalité. \\nAnalyse : Un contrat contraignant a-t-il été créé ? \\n[100] La partie qui invoque l\\'existence d\\'un contrat entièrement oral a la charge de l\\'établir. Ce \\nfaisant, \\n“(i) it is necessary to examine the words and actions of the parties in order to \\ndetermine what they intended; (ii) evidence of the parties’ subjective intentions has \\nno independent place in deciding what the terms of the agreement were; (iii) rather, \\nthe test of what the parties agreed to is an objective one; and (iv) the contract must \\ninclude the necessary ingredients of offer, acceptance and consideration.1 \\n[101] Pour qu’un contrat soit valable, il doit y avoir à la fois une intention commune de contracter \\net une clarté quant aux modalités essentielles du contrat : \\n“[47] […] For a contract to exist, there must be a meeting of minds, commonly \\nreferred to as consensus ad idem. The test as to whether there has been a meeting \\nof the minds is an objective one - would an objective, reasonable bystander \\nconclude that, in all the circumstances, the parties intended to contract? As intention \\nalone is insufficient to create an enforceable agreement, it is necessary that the \\nessential terms of the agreement are also sufficiently certain. […]”2 \\n \\n[102] Les modalités essentielles d’un contrat pour l’achat d’un bien-fonds comprennent : (1) les \\nparties impliquées dans la transaction ; (2) la description précise du  bien-fonds ; (3) le prix \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 S&J Gareri Trucking Ltd c Onyx Corp, [2016] OJ No 3509, 2016 ONCA 505, au para 7; Fulton v KOA Aloha Inc, \\n[2018] OJ No 3497, 2018 ONSC 3261, au para 44. \\n2 UBS Securities Canada Inc c Sands Brothers Canada Ltd, 95 OR (3d) 93, 2009 ONCA 328, au para 47. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\nconvenu pour la vente ; ainsi que (4) la date à laquelle le transfert de propriété doit avoir \\nlieu. Ces éléments sont fondamentaux pour définir les bases de la transaction et assurer la \\nclarté des termes d’un contrat.3 Ces modalités essentielles ont également été reconnues \\ndans la décision de la Cour d’appel de l’Ontario dans l’affaire Mountain c TD Canada \\nTrust Company, 2012 ONCA 806. \\n[103] Pour déterminer si un contrat a été créé, le tribunal doit examiner toutes les circonstances \\nentourant l\\'accord présumé afin de décider si les parties sont parvenues à un accord et, si \\nc\\'est le cas, de déterminer les conditions auxquelles elles se sont engagées. Ces \\ncirconstances comprennent les paroles et le comportement, les actions futures et les \\ndéclarations des deux parties, ainsi que lien confiance. 4 \\n[104] Je constate qu\\'une réunion a eu lieu à la fin de juin ou de juillet 1986. Les deux intimés, M. \\nLamadeleine, et M. Lortie étaient présents. Une conversation au sujet de la ruelle a eu lieu, \\nmais les détails de cette brève conversation ne peuvent être précisés avec exactitude. Les \\nsouvenirs se sont estompés au cours des nombreuses années qui se sont écoulées depuis, et \\nles souvenirs des intimés ont été influencés par le passage du temps et par leurs souhaits \\nsubjectifs concernant la ruelle. \\n[105] J\\'estime que, objectivement, les parties n\\'ont pas conclu de contrat lors de la rencontre dans \\nla ruelle en 1986. Bien que j\\'accepte que les intimés croient subjectivement qu\\'un contrat \\noral a été conclu entre les parties, je suis d\\'avis qu\\'il n\\'y a pas eu de contrat entre les parties. \\nJe conclus qu\\'il n\\'y a pas eu de rencontre des volontés entre la Municipalité et les intimés \\nen ce qui concerne les éléments essentiels de l\\'entente verbale alléguée. Les preuves qui \\nm\\'ont été présentées sur la demande m\\'amènent à conclure que certains termes de l\\'accord \\nétaient soit insuffisamment précis, soit inexistants. \\n[106] Selon la preuve présentée, je conclus que la date du transfert de la propriété n\\'a jamais été \\nconvenue entre les parties. La preuve devant moi n\\'établit pas qu\\'il y a eu une discussion \\nsur cet élément essentiel d\\'un contrat portant sur un immeuble. Les affidavits des intimés \\net de Mme Durocher ne traitent pas de la date envisagée pour le transfert de la propriété en \\nlitige.     \\n[107] L\\'absence de date de transfert est cohérente avec les événements ultérieurs. Le transfert de \\nla ruelle n\\'a jamais eu lieu. Les intimés ou la Municipalité n\\'ont pris aucune mesure pour \\neffectuer le transfert. Les intimés n\\'ont pas fait de suivi auprès de la Municipalité pour \\nconfirmer le transfert ou l\\'inscrire au registre foncier. Le prétendu accord oral n\\'a jamais \\nété confirmé par écrit ou d\\'une autre manière après la rencontre de 1986 au sujet de la \\nruelle.  \\n[108] Le deuxième élément essentiel qui mérite d\\'être examiné de près est le prix de la vente du \\nterrain de la ruelle. Les affidavits des intimés indiquent que M. Lamadeleine a proposé de \\n                                                 \\n \\n3 Simcoe Vacant Land Condominium Corp No 272 c Blue Shores Developments Ltd, 126 OR (3d) 39, 2015 ONCA \\n378, au para 37; McKenzie v Walsh, [1920] SCJ No 68, 61 SCR 312, au para 1. \\n4 UBS Securities Canada Inc c Sands Brothers Canada Ltd, 95 OR (3d) 93, 2009 ONCA 328, au para 47. \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 25 \\n \\n \\nvendre la parcelle de terrain pour le prix d\\'un dollar. Cette preuve est spécifiquement niée \\npar M. Lamadeleine, qui soutien n’avoir jamais accepté de vendre la ruelle. Il a expliqué \\nque la Municipalité de Casselman n\\'était pas encline à vendre la ruelle, car il s\\'agissait d\\'un \\nespace public d\\'importance stratégique réservé aux services municipaux.  La déclaration \\nsous serment d\\'Yves Morrissette, l\\'actuel directeur général de la Municipalité de \\nCasselman, confirme cette affirmation.  \\n[109] Il n\\'y a pas de preuve confirmant que le montant de 1 $ a été convenu : \\na. Il n\\'y a aucune preuve que le montant d\\'un dollar n’a jamais été payé à la \\nMunicipalité ; et \\nb. les registres officiels de la Municipalité, y compris les ordres du jour et les procès-\\nverbaux des réunions du conseil municipal au moment de l\\'accord ou par la suite, \\nne font aucune mention de la vente du terrain litigieux pour un dollar. \\n[110] La preuve par affidavit de Mme Durocher contredit la preuve des intimés. Selon Mme \\nDurocher, la ruelle contestée n\\'a pas été vendue aux intimés à titre onéreux même pour un \\nmontant symbolique, mais leur a plutôt été donnée sans contrepartie.  Cela dit, après avoir \\nexaminé l\\'affidavit et le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Durocher, je ne pense pas qu\\'elle \\nsoit une historienne fiable des événements examinés dans cette affaire. Je note en outre \\nqu\\'elle entretient des relations étroites avec les intimés. \\n[111] Je constate aussi que les détails spécifiques de la parcelle de terrain à transférer dans le \\ncadre de ce prétendu accord n\\'ont pas été établis par les intimés. \\n[112] Les parties à l\\'accord oral allégué doivent être prises en considération. La preuve qui m\\'a \\nété présentée n\\'est pas claire du tout et, d\\'un point de vue objectif, les parties n\\'ont pas été \\nprouvées avec certitude. La preuve est contradictoire. \\n[113] Selon l\\'intimé Godard, M. Lamadeleine a fait savoir que tous les résidents des rues Martin \\net Filion feraient partie de l\\'entente.  Les intimés suggèrent également que seuls les intimés \\net Mme Durocher étaient parties à l\\'entente verbale. Il faut noter que l\\'intimée Cléroux \\nn\\'avait que 17 ans au moment de cette prétendue entente verbale et qu\\'elle n\\'était pas \\npropriétaire d\\'un terrain adjacent à la ruelle Martin-Filion. Mme Durocher n\\'était pas \\nprésente lors de la rencontre qui a mené à l\\'entente verbale contestée. La preuve révèle \\nclairement que seuls les intimés Godard et Cléroux étaient présents à la rencontre de 1986 \\navec le maire Lamadeleine et M. Lortie. \\n[114] Je n\\'accepte pas que Mme Durocher ait été partie à cette entente. Non seulement elle n\\'était \\npas présente à la réunion de 1986, mais elle ne possédait pas non plus de propriété contiguë \\nà la ruelle au moment de la réunion. L\\'affidavit de Mme Durocher reconnaît qu\\'elle n\\'était \\npas partie à l\\'accord oral présumé de 1986.    \\n[115] De même, je conclus que Mme Cléroux n\\'a pas participé à un prétendu accord en 1986 à la \\nlumière de ce qui suit : \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 26 \\n \\n \\na. Elle n\\'était pas propriétaire d\\'une propriété contiguë à la ruelle litigieuse en 1986. \\nElle a acheté sa propriété de la rue Martin en 1992 ; \\nb. Elle a confirmé en contre-interrogatoire qu\\'elle n\\'était pas partie à l\\'entente verbale \\nalléguée ; et \\nc. Aucune promesse n\\'a été faite à Mme Cléroux après l\\'achat de sa propriété en 1992, \\nbien qu\\'elle se soit adressée à la Municipalité à ce sujet. \\n[116] Je conclus que les intimés ne se sont pas acquittés de la charge de la preuve qui leur \\nincombait d\\'établir une personne qui était partie à ce prétendu accord. Il n\\'existe aucune \\nbase objective permettant de conclure qui, le cas échéant, était partie à l\\'accord allégué. \\nAlors que les intimés croient subjectivement qu\\'ils étaient parties à un accord oral, \\nobjectivement, je ne peux pas arriver à la même conclusion. Je n\\'accepte pas que des \\npersonnes qui n\\'étaient pas présentes à la réunion ou qui ne possédaient pas de propriété \\ncontiguë à la ruelle puissent être parties à l\\'accord litigieux. Contrairement à la preuve \\nprésentée par les intimés, M. Lamadeleine nie toute entente et il est douteux que la \\nMunicipalité s\\'entende avec un propriétaire à l\\'exclusion de tous les autres résidents du \\nsecteur de la ruelle Martin-Filion. La preuve n\\'établit pas objectivement un consensus ad \\nidem quant aux parties à l\\'entente. \\n[117] Les facteurs additionnels suivants m\\'amènent également à conclure que, objectivement, il \\nn\\'y a pas eu de consensus ad idem entre les parties : \\na. Les déclarations de M. Lamadeleine étaient formulées au conditionnel.  Le \\nconditionnel est un temps grammatical qui sert à exprimer des actions \\nhypothétiques. Ces déclarations ne peuvent donc pas être considérées \\nobjectivement comme établissant un accord contractuel. \\nb. Selon la preuve des intimés concernant la réunion de 1986, M. Lortie n\\'était pas \\nd\\'accord avec la vente de la ruelle. La preuve des intimés indique qu\\'ils considèrent \\nM. Lortie comme étant honnête et digne de confiance. L’absence de suivi de la part \\nde la Municipalité, notamment de la part de M. Lortie après la réunion de 1986, \\nsuggère l’absence d’un accord entre les parties lors de cette réunion. Une personne \\nraisonnable et objective conclurait qu’il n’y a pas eu d’accord entre les parties, car \\nil n’y a pas eu de suivi de part et d’autre. \\nc. Les actions de l\\'intimé Godard demandant à la Municipalité d\\'entretenir la ruelle \\nsuggèrent qu`il n`y a pas eu de contrat oral entre les parties. En avril 2023, lors \\nd’une tempête de verglas qui a fait tomber certaines branches d’un arbre situé dans \\nla ruelle sur la propriété de M. Godard, M. Godard a contacté la Municipalité pour \\ndemander de venir enlever les branches de son terrain. Lors du contre-\\ninterrogatoire, lorsqu’il a été interrogé à ce sujet, M. Godard a mentionné qu’il était \\nde la responsabilité de la Municipalité de venir ramasser les branches, car elles \\nprovenaient d’un arbre situé dans la ruelle. Ce comportement de M. Godard suggère \\nque la ruelle appartient à la Municipalité et qu\\'aucun contrat oral n\\'avait été créé.  \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 27 \\n \\n \\nd. Il n\\'existe aucune preuve documentaire ou écrite confirmant l\\'existence d\\'un contrat \\noral ou de ses termes. \\n[118] En résumé, pour les raisons susmentionnées, je conclus que les intimées n\\'ont pas prouvé, \\nobjectivement, qu\\'un contrat oral avait été créé en 1986 entre les parties. Les termes de \\nl’accord allégué n\\'ont pas été objectivement établis. Pour qu\\'il y ait contrat, il faut qu\\'il y \\nait accord sur les termes essentiels. Je conclus que cela n\\'a pas été établi. \\nAnalyse : La Loi relative aux preuves littérales et la doctrine de l’exécution partielle \\n[119] In light of my finding that the evidence does not establish that the parties formed a mutual \\nintention to enter into an agreement with each other and that they agreed as to the essential \\nterms of that agreement, it is not necessary to consider the equitable doctrine of part \\nperformance which allows the court to enforce an oral agreement if it is unconscionable to \\napply the Statute of Frauds to render a contract unenforceable. However, in the event I am \\nwrong in so finding, I will consider whether any oral agreement is unenforceable under the \\nStatute of Frauds.  \\n[120] À la lumière de ma conclusion selon laquelle la preuve n\\'établit pas que les parties avaient \\nl\\'intention mutuelle de conclure un accord entre elles et qu\\'elles étaient d\\'accord sur les \\ntermes essentiels de cet accord, il n\\'est pas nécessaire d\\'examiner la doctrine équitable de \\nl\\'exécution partielle. Celle-ci permet au tribunal d\\'exécuter un accord oral, s\\'il est \\ndéraisonnable d\\'appliquer la Loi relative aux preuves littérales, pour rendre un contrat \\napplicable. Toutefois, au cas où j\\'aurais tort de conclure ainsi, j\\'examinerai si un accord \\noral est applicable en vertu de la Loi relative aux preuves littérales. \\n[121] La jurisprudence pertinente est brièvement résumée dans l’arrêt Xynos c. Xynos5: \\nIf the existence of an oral agreement for the sale of land is proven, s. 4 of the Statute \\nof Frauds renders that agreement unenforceable unless the equitable doctrine of \\npart performance applies. The equitable doctrine of part performance allows the \\ncourt to enforce an oral agreement in cases where it is unconscionable to apply the \\nStatute of Frauds to render a contract unenforceable. As explained by Gillese J.A. \\nin Erie Sand, at para. 49, \"the requirements of s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds must \\ngive way in the face of part performance because the acts of part performance fulfill \\nthe very purpose of the written document - that is, they diminish the opportunity \\nfor fraudulent dealings with land based on perjured evidence\". \\nThe doctrine of part performance has two requirements: \\n \\n1. Detrimental reliance; and, \\n                                                 \\n \\n5 2023 ONSC 830 au paras. 107-108 \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 28 \\n \\n \\n2. Acts of part performance that sufficiently indicate the existence of the \\nalleged contract, because the acts are unequivocally referable in their own \\nnature to some dealing with the land. \\n[122] J\\'ai également examiné et pris en compte Erie Sand and Gravel Ltd c Seres\\' Farms Ltd.6 et \\nMountain c TD Canada Trust Company7 en ce qui concerne la Loi relative aux preuves \\nlittérales et la doctrine de l’exécution partielle. \\n[123] J\\'estime qu\\'il n\\'y a pas eu de confiance préjudiciable en l\\'espèce. Ce faisant, j\\'ai examiné si \\nl\\'une des parties à un accord par ailleurs inapplicable est restée passive alors que l\\'autre \\npartie a agi à son détriment en remplissant ses obligations contractuelles. Si tel était le cas, \\nla première partie ne pourrait pas invoquer les exigences de la Loi relative aux preuves \\nlittérales. \\n[124] J\\'estime que les intimés n\\'ont pas établi que la Municipalité est restée passive dans le cadre \\ndes obligations contractuelles, alors que les intimés ont agi à leur propre détriment. J\\'ai pris \\nen considération les éléments de preuve suivants :  \\na. Les intimés n\\'ont pas établi qu\\'ils ont agie à leur propre détriment. Les intimés ont \\ncontinué à utiliser la ruelle comme ils l\\'ont toujours fait depuis plus de 40 ans. \\nb. Bien que les intimés soutiennent qu’ils ont dépensé de l\\'argent pour entretenir et \\naméliorer la ruelle, le montant consacré à cette fin n\\'est pas prouvé.  \\nc. Les biens des intimés que la Municipalité cherche à faire déplacer pour permettre \\nl\\'exécution de travaux sont faciles à déplacer. La preuve établit que les petites \\nstructures sont déplaçables. \\nd. Concernant les arbres et les arbustes dans la ruelle, qui sont considérés comme des \\naccessoires fixes, il est important de noter que cette végétation appartient à la \\nMunicipalité. En effet, les troncs de ces arbres et arbustes sont situés dans la ruelle. \\nAucune preuve n’a été présentée pour démontrer que ces arbres et arbustes ont été \\nplantés par les intimés. Par conséquent, il n’est pas établi que les intimés subiraient \\nun préjudice du fait du retrait de certains de ces arbres et arbustes. \\ne. Selon l’affidavit de Yves Morrissette, un système de drainage a été installé \\nlongitudinalement, s’étendant d’est en ouest, dans la partie nord des réserves \\nroutières. Ce système a été spécialement conçu pour canaliser les eaux de pluie \\nprovenant de la Ruelle Martin-Filion vers le ponceau d’eau pluviale situé sur la rue \\nMartin. La Municipalité a assumé la responsabilité de l’entretien et de l’inspection \\nrégulière de ce système de drainage. \\n                                                 \\n \\n6 2009 ONCA 709 \\n7 2013 ONCA 806 \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 29 \\n \\n \\n[125] La deuxième condition de la doctrine de l\\'exécution partielle, comme indiquée ci-dessus, \\nest “acts of part performance that sufficiently indicate the existence of the alleged contract, \\nbecause the acts are unequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with the \\nland.” \\n[126] Je conclus que tout acte d\\'exécution partielle de la part des intimés ne se rapporte pas au \\ncontrat oral relatif aux biens-fonds. Les gestes d’exécution des intimés dans la ruelle ont \\nété faits indépendamment de l’entente orale de 1986. Leur utilisation de la ruelle a été faite \\ndans le cours normal de l’utilisation de la ruelle et n’était pas liée à la rencontre de 1986. \\nLes résidents ont décidé d’utiliser la ruelle sans aucune discussion ou aucun accord avec la \\nrequérante, la plupart du temps avant 1986. \\n[127] Je conclus que les actes des résidents sont conformes à l’usage ordinaire que feraient des \\nrésidents d’une ruelle municipale en milieu rural. La preuve ne démontre tout simplement \\npas que les intimés étaient au courant d’un tel accord et qu’ils ont agi sur la base de cet \\naccord. \\n[128] La preuve révèle que l\\'intimé Godard a utilisé la ruelle bien avant la discussion de l\\'été \\n1986. Il l’a notamment utilisée pour installer un cabanon, sa roulotte et son véhicule avant \\nla rencontre de 1986. M. Godard a confirmé qu’il utilisait un petit cabanon situé dans la \\nruelle pour élever des chapons et ensuite des lapins en 1978, soit huit ans avant le prétendu \\ncontrat oral. \\n[129] Cette preuve d\\'utilisation de la ruelle avant la discussion de 1986 est confirmée par l\\'intimée \\nCléroux. \\n[130] En ce qui concerne Mme Durocher, la preuve révèle qu\\'elle n\\'a pris connaissance de \\nl\\'entente sur la ruelle litigieuse qu\\'après l\\'achat de sa propriété en 2000. \\n[131] J\\'estime que la preuve a établi que les actes concernant la ruelle ont été accomplis de \\nmanière indépendante et ne sont donc pas liés aux discussions de 1986 à propos de la ruelle. \\n[132] Seuls les intimés, M. Lamadeleine et M. Lortie étaient présents à la discussion sur la ruelle \\nen 1986. Il y a en tout 17 lots concernés par la ruelle et la preuve au dossier permet \\nseulement de démontrer que les propriétaires de deux lots étaient au courant de ces \\ndiscussions relatives à une prétendue vente de celle-ci. En l’absence de preuves étayant la \\nconnaissance de ces discussions par les autres résidents des autres lots, il est impossible de \\nconclure que les actes de tous les autres résidents étaient en rapport avec les conversations \\nde 1986. Il n’est pas possible d’établir un lien direct entre les actes des résidents et les \\ndiscussions contractuelles en question. \\n[133] Je conclus que le deuxième critère de la doctrine de l’exécution partielle n\\'a pas été établi. \\nEn résumé, les actions entreprises n\\'ont aucun lien avec le contrat allégué et le bien. \\nOrdonnance \\n2024 ONCS 1843 (CanLII)\\nPage: 30 \\n \\n \\n[134] Une ordonnance déclaratoire sera émise établissant que la Municipalité de Casselman est \\npropriétaire de la ruelle Martin-Filion.

Following Mr. Creighton’s death in November 2020, his estate was \\nliquidated, and members of Laurie Dillon’s family were involved in the sale of an estate asset. At \\nthe time, the Applicant, Laurie Dillon, was the co-president of the CAS Board of Directors. \\n[2] \\nGiven the implication of Ms. Dillon and her family’s involvement in the sale of estate \\nproperty, allegations were made that Ms. Dillon was in a conflict of interest and that she had \\nbreached her fiduciary duties to the CAS. The CAS Board moved that Ms. Dillon recuse herself \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nfrom her roles and responsibilities and eventually, the CAS decided to revoke Ms. Dillon’s \\nmembership. She appealed that decision to the CAS and her appeal was refused. \\n[3] \\nThe Applicant now brings this Application seeking the following relief: \\na. \\nan Order that the decision of the Respondent dated April 8, 2022 to maintain \\nthe previous December 19, 2021 decision to revoke the Applicant’s membership in \\nthe CAS is null and void; \\nb. \\nan Order directing the Respondent to reinstate the Applicant’s membership \\nin the CAS in compliance with s. 32 of the Agricultural and Horticultural \\nOrganizations Act,1 and s. 49 of the Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, 2010 (“NFPA”);2 \\nand \\nc. \\nin the alternative to the Order requested immediately above, an Order directing \\nthat the matter be remitted for investigation anew by a differently constituted \\nExecutive Committee and for consideration afresh by the Board of Directors \\npursuant to the CAS’s constitution, by-laws, and regulations and in accordance with \\nthis court’s reasons. \\n[4] \\nThe CAS brings a Cross-Application seeking an Order declaring the Applicant to have \\nbreached (a) her fiduciary duty to the CAS; and (b) the CAS’s constitution or its policies and \\nprocedures. \\n[5] \\nFor the reasons that follow, I conclude that the CAS Board breached the rules of natural \\njustice in the manner that it investigated and decided the matters related to the Applicant’s \\nmembership and as such the decision to revoke her membership is set aside and declared null and \\nvoid. Furthermore, the CAS Board erred when it concluded that the Applicant was in a conflict of \\ninterest and that she breached her fiduciary duties to the Board. Accordingly, pursuant to s. 191 of \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 R.S.O. 1990, c. A.9. \\n2 S.O. 2010, c. 15. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nthe NFPA, the Applicant’s membership is reinstated and the Respondent’s Cross-Application is \\ndismissed. \\n \\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \\nThe Transactions \\n[6] \\nThe CAS is a not-for-profit agricultural society incorporated under the Agricultural \\nand Horticultural Organizations Act. It puts on the Carp Fair annually. The CAS is funded by the \\nMinister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs, the City of Ottawa and third-party donors. The \\nCAS claims that each of their donors has an interest in ensuring that CAS directors behave \\nethically and appropriately with respect to CAS funds. Mr. Brent Palsson is the CAS’s \\nrepresentative in this proceeding in his capacity as past co-president of the CAS Board of Directors. \\n[7] \\nThe Applicant, Ms. Dillon, a real estate agent and mother of two, lives in the Village of \\nCarp, a rural community west of Ottawa. She served on the CAS’s Board of Directors for 12 years, \\nin addition to three years as an associate director. In January 2021, she was serving as co-president \\nof the Board. Ms. Dillon is married to Tim Dillon, also a real estate agent. She is also the daughter \\nof Bruce Baird, a retired general contractor and former CAS Board president. Mr. Baird is married \\nto Gail Baird, Ms. Dillon’s stepmother. \\n[8] \\nOn November 9, 2020, David Creighton, a long-time Carp Fair volunteer, passed away. \\nMr. Creighton’s Will specified that 75 percent of his estate, comprising mainly of his house, was \\nto be left to the CAS. As early as November 20, 2020, but no later than December 16, 2020, \\nMs. Dillon learned that the CAS was a 75 percent beneficiary to the Creighton Estate.  \\n[9] \\nPrior to his death, Mr. Creighton promised his friend and neighbour, Taylor White, that \\nhe would have the right of first refusal to buy his home upon his passing. Mr. Creighton had a \\nprice point of $300,000 in mind for the Creighton property. \\n[10] \\nWhen Mr. Creighton died, his estate’s Estate Trustee, Margaret “Peggy” Blair, contacted \\nMr. White to inquire if he was indeed interested in buying the property. Mr. White responded to \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nMs. Blair that he had obtained advice from a realtor that a price of $240,000 would be \\nappropriate. In the realtor’s opinion, a principal drawback to the property was that a road allowance \\nto the rear of the property onto Salisbury Street was unable to be opened, which limited the \\nfuture development potential of the property. \\n[11] \\nIn the weeks following Mr. Creighton’s death, Ms. Blair sought the opinion of her friend \\nand neighbour, Mr. Dillon, as to the market value of the property to ensure the $300,000 price \\ndiscussed between the late Mr. Creighton and Mr. White was reasonable. Mr. Dillon advised that \\n$310,000 was likely a fair and reasonable price, based on his assessment of comparable \\nlistings in the area. Mr. Dillon recommended to Ms. Blair that the property should go to market. \\nHe advised that the only way to access fair market value is to list the property and expose it for at \\nleast five days.  \\n[12] \\nWhen Ms. Blair advised Mr. Dillon of Mr. White’s price of $240,000, based on the limits \\nof future development due to the inability to open the property onto Salisbury Street, Mr. Dillon \\nsought advice from his father-in-law, Mr. Baird. Mr. Baird suggested that Mr. Dillon confirm \\nthis information with the City of Ottawa. Mr. Dillon was informed by email on December 28, 2020 \\nthat the road allowance could be opened and access to Salisbury Street would be granted.  That \\ninformation was shared with Ms. Blair. \\n[13] \\nMs. Blair returned to Mr. White with this new information, asking whether he might \\nchange his mind and purchase the property with the knowledge that the property could, in fact, \\nbe opened onto Salisbury Street and further developed. Mr. White declined to make a second \\noffer. In the meantime, Mr. Baird indicated to Mr. Dillon that, should Mr. White decline to \\npurchase the property, he would be interested in purchasing the property for the asking price of \\n$300,000 and develop it himself. Mr. Dillon relayed that information to Ms. Blair. \\n[14] \\nMs. Blair asked Mr. White at the beginning of January 2021 if he wished to purchase the \\nproperty for $300,000, knowing all the facts about development potential and that Mr. Baird was \\ninterested in purchasing and developing the property. He declined, telling Ms. Blair that he \\ndid not think it made financial sense for him to purchase the Creighton property, and that he had \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\npurchased a lot in a neighbouring subdivision and was in the process of building a home with his \\nfiancée. \\n[15] \\nOn January 4, 2021, Ms. Blair told Mr. Dillon via voicemail that she would accept the offer \\nfrom Mr. Baird if it was still on the table. Mr. and Mrs. Baird agreed to purchase the property \\nshortly thereafter for $300,000 (the “first transaction”). \\n[16] \\nOn January 30, 2021, when Ms. Blair obtained a Certificate of Appointment of Estate \\nTrustee With a Will, she entered into a formal Agreement of Purchase and Sale with Mr. and \\nMrs. Baird for the purchase and sale of the Creighton property, with a February 16, 2021 closing \\ndate. Mr. Dillon acted as the agent for Mr. and Mrs. Baird on this first transaction. Though \\nMr. Dillon did not intend to charge a commission given his close ties with Ms. Blair, she insisted \\nthat he do so. This is because, according to Ms. Blair, Mr. Creighton had always been paid by \\nhis friends and neighbours for the work he did for them; it was only fair that Mr. Dillon was paid \\nfor his work. \\n[17] \\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Dillon are realtors with Greater Ottawa Realty Inc., a real estate \\nbrokerage owned by the Applicant’s mother. When either Mr. or Mrs. Dillon make a sale, that \\nmonetary benefit flows to the brokerage. Clearly, there is still a benefit to them upon a sale of a \\nproperty. \\n[18] \\nFor about six weeks prior to the first transaction’s close, Mr. Baird was in contact with \\na City of Ottawa planner, as well engineers and an architect, land surveyor, planning \\nconsultant, landscaper, and construction contractor to organize for the property’s eventual \\ndevelopment. As a result of development challenges, Mr. and Mrs. Baird decided to abandon the \\ndevelopment project and to list the property for sale on February 19, 2021 for $450,000. The next \\nday, they received a $500,000 offer for it, with no conditions and set to expire that day. They \\naccepted the offer, and the sale closed on March 26, 2021 (the “second transaction”). The buyer \\nwas unknown to Mr. and Mrs. Baird and there is no evidence that the buyer had any links to any \\nindividual involved in this litigation. \\n[19] \\nNeither Mr. or Mrs. Dillon nor Greater Ottawa Realty Inc. took a commission when they \\nrepresented Mr. and Mrs. Baird in the second transaction, being their resale of the Creighton \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nproperty. Ms. Dillon acknowledges that they did not take a commission when representing her \\nparents in the Creighton property’s resale “because it’s [her] dad” and she “like[s] [her] dad and \\n[did not] want to charge him any money [she did not] have to”. \\n \\n \\nThe Board’s Response \\n[20] \\nIn or about the end of February 2021, the Applicant was approached by Mr. Palsson to \\nencourage her to address the issues surrounding the sale of the Creighton property with the CAS \\nBoard of Directors. \\n[21] \\nAt the March 4, 2021 meeting of the Board, there was no request by the Applicant to \\naddress this matter with the Board but she did discuss the matter with at least two other Board \\nmembers prior to the meeting. However, the subject of Mr. and Mrs. Baird’s sale of the property \\nfor profit was put up for discussion despite not been listed in the meeting’s agenda.  \\n[22] \\nDuring this meeting, the minutes reflect that Board members raised issues of a potential \\nconflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duties in respect of the Applicant. Members of the Board \\nwere concerned about the public perception of these transactions. A motion was passed that a \\nthird party look into the matter. The Executive Committee, minus Ms. Dillon and Mr. Neil Falls, \\nwas to be the point of contact. A further motion was made by Board member Michael Jensen to \\nthe effect that Ms. Dillon should recuse herself from her roles and responsibilities until the third \\nparty helped to figure out a solution. At some point, Ms. Dillon was invited to leave the Board \\nmeeting. \\n[23] \\nOn June 23, 2021, Ms. Dillon, alongside her family and legal counsel, attended a \\nmeeting at the CAS’s office. She states that she came prepared with and offered all information, \\nincluding real estate documents, legal correspondence, emails, and texts, supporting her claim that \\nshe had not been involved in any of the transactions regarding the Creighton Estate. At the end \\nof the meeting, Mr. Falls indicated that he would return to the Board and solve the matter. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\n[24] \\nIn July 2021, Mr. Falls informed Ms. Dillon’s legal counsel that the CAS was looking to \\nhire a third party to look further into the matter. On August 26, 2021, Ms. Dillon was informed \\nthat a CAS Executive Committee had been formed to investigate the circumstances \\nsurrounding the sale, purchase, and resale of the Creighton property. A number of questions were \\nput to her in writing.   \\n[25] \\nWith the investigation now to be conducted by the Executive Committee, Ms. Dillon \\nresponded that she felt that she would not be subjected to a fair and unbiased process and refused \\nto participate in the investigation at that time. \\n[26] \\nThe Executive Committee reached out to Ms. Blair, the Estate Trustee of the Creighton \\nEstate, on multiple occasions to engage her in the investigation process. She declined to \\nparticipate.  \\n[27] \\nOn November 2, 2021, Ms. Dillon’s new legal counsel advised that her position had \\nchanged and that she now intended to respond to the CAS letter of August 26, 2021. \\n[28] \\nOn November 12, 2021, counsel for CAS communicated that the Executive Committee \\nhad completed its investigation and reported back to the CAS Board. The lawyer’s letter advises \\nthat the Board found the following: \\na. \\nMs. Dillon breached her fiduciary obligations to the CAS; \\nb. \\nshe was in conflict of interest and in breach of the CAS’s constitution, as well as \\nthe applicable policies and procedures; and \\nc. \\ndiscipline was warranted as a result of the engagement of her husband as real estate \\nagent for the Creighton property through which he received a commission and her \\nfailure to disclose and address the conflict of interest created by that situation as well as \\nthe situation created when her father purchased the Creighton property and then sold the \\nproperty for profit. \\n[29] \\nAccordingly, the lawyer’s letter purports to state that the CAS Board’s findings are as \\nfollows: \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\na. \\nMr. Dillon was engaged as real estate agent for the Creighton property through \\nwhich he received a commission; and \\nb. \\nThe Applicant failed to disclose the conflict of interest created by that situation as \\nwell as the situation when her father purchased the Creighton property and then sold the \\nproperty for profit. \\n[30] \\nThe minutes of a CAS Board meeting dated November 9, 2021, when this decision is \\npurported to have been made, make no mention of these findings or reasons. The minutes of that \\nmeeting only state that the Board requests Ms. Dillon’s resignation, failing which her membership \\nis to be revoked.  \\n[31] \\nMs. Dillon declined to resign and requested that the investigation be reopened so that she \\nmay be afforded the opportunity to proffer evidence. The request was refused, and a second \\nrequest to reconsider this decision was also refused such that Ms. Dillon’s membership was \\nrevoked. \\n[32] \\nOn December 30, 2021, Ms. Dillon appealed the revocation decision and requested that \\nshe be given the opportunity to plead her case in person before the members of the Board. She \\nsubmitted affidavits from Mr. Baird and Mr. Dillon, as well as from herself. \\n[33] \\nOn January 19, 2022, Ms. Dillon’s appeal was allowed in part; the Society chose to reopen \\nthe investigation and directed a series of questions to her to be answered in writing. Further \\ndocumentation was provided on March 21, 2022 in support of Ms. Dillon’s appeal. \\n[34] \\nOn April 8, 2022, the Society maintained its original decision to revoke her membership \\nthrough a letter from the CAS legal counsel. No reasons were given and no information about the \\nfindings that were relied upon was provided. The only information is that everything was \\nconsidered and that the CAS Board maintains its original decision. While there are minutes of a \\nmeeting dated April 5, 2022, when the Board purportedly made its decision, the minutes contain \\nno reasons or indication of what the Board considered in arriving at its decision. \\nThe CAS Constitution, Policies, and Procedures \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\n[35] \\nThe CAS has adopted the Carp Agricultural Society Constitution (the \\n“Constitution”). As a director of the Board, Ms. Dillon was bound by the Constitution. Ms. Dillon, \\nhaving been a director for some 12 years, was familiar with the CAS Constitution and had \\nreviewed it in detail. \\n \\n \\n[36] \\n Under the CAS Constitution, CAS directors must do the following: \\nf. \\nfollow the organization’s bylaws, policies, and board resolutions \\ng. disclose potential conflicts before meetings and actual conflicts during meetings \\n[…] \\nl. \\nensure strong fiduciary oversight and financial management \\n[…] \\no. enhance the organization’s public image. \\n[37] \\n Directors are also required to comply with the CAS Policies and Procedures Handbook \\n(“Handbook”). Having been a CAS director for years, Ms. Dillon was familiar with the Handbook \\nand was aware that Handbook policies and procedures applied to her. The Handbook frames \\ndirectors’ fiduciary duties to the CAS and addresses issues relating to duty of care, conflicts of \\ninterest, duty of loyalty, setting aside personal self-interest, and performing their duties in a \\nmanner that promotes public confidence in the CAS. The Handbook also addresses how directors \\nought to deal with conflicts of interest, including requiring that they “openly disclose a potential, \\nreal or perceived conflict of interest as soon as the issue arises”. \\n[38] \\nIn cross-examination, Ms. Dillon confirmed that she is familiar with the concept of conflict \\nof interest, both from practising as a real estate agent and from serving as a director of the Board. \\nShe understood, during her 12-year tenure as a CAS director, that she owed the CAS a fiduciary \\nduty and that, as a fiduciary, she was required to put the CAS’s interests ahead of her own. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\n[39] \\nUnder the CAS Constitution, the Board may “revoke the membership of the member in \\nthe Society, a record of which will be documented and retained on file by the Society and will \\nremain as a permanent record.” The Constitution requires that notification of revocation be in \\nwriting and given to the member. \\n \\n \\n[40] \\n The process to be followed during the CAS disciplinary process is set out below and \\nincludes the following:  \\na. \\nA member may report any instance of an unacceptable act by a current member, \\ndirector, or officer to the Executive Committee.  \\nb. \\nThe Executive Committee will then immediately and fully investigate the matter, \\nobjectively analyze the relevant information, identify facts, and afford the member \\nunder review adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in his or her defence. The \\nExecutive Committee will then report the facts, its findings, and recommendations for \\nthe Board’s review and consideration.  \\nc. \\nThe Board will then deliberate, make any necessary findings of fact, and make a \\ndetermination on the matter. \\nANALYSIS \\n[41] \\nThis application is governed by the broad authority given to the courts pursuant to s. 191 \\nof the NFPA, which reads as follows: \\n \\nCompliance or restraining order \\n191 On the application of a complainant or a creditor of a corporation, the court \\nmay make an order directing the corporation or any director, officer, employee, \\nagent, auditor, trustee, receiver, receiver-manager or liquidator of the corporation \\nto comply with this Act, the regulations or the articles or by-laws of the \\ncorporation or restraining any such person from acting in breach of them and may \\nmake any further order that it thinks fit. 2010, c. 15, s. 191. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n[42] \\nThis section allows for a court to make any order that it thinks fit and, in these \\ncircumstances, would allow the court to determine if the Applicant has been aggrieved by the \\nprocess that led to the revocation of her membership in the CAS as contemplated by s. 51 of the \\nNFPA. \\n[43] \\nIn this Application, the court has essentially been requested to assess the following: \\na. \\nthe process the CAS Board followed to discipline the Applicant as a result of the \\nmatters which flowed from the death of Mr. Creighton and if there was a breach of \\nnatural justice; \\nb. \\nif the Applicant was in a conflict of interest pursuant to the applicable statute or the \\nCAS’s by-laws and procedures; \\nc. \\nif the Applicant breached her fiduciary duties to the corporation; and \\nd. \\nif the CAS’s decision to terminate the Applicant’s membership in the corporation \\nwas a reasonable one in all the circumstances. \\nNatural Justice \\n[44] \\nThe CAS Constitution has a Disciplinary Policy that sets out the process to be followed: \\n1. \\nIn the event that the Board determines that there may be grounds for a \\nmember to be expelled or suspended from the Society, the Board shall conduct a \\nreview of the matter in accordance with this Disciplinary Policy as follows: \\n1. \\nReporting Phase – Any instance of an unacceptable act as described \\nabove may be reported to the Executive Committee by a current member, \\ndirector or officer of the Society. \\n2. \\nInvestigation Phase – The Executive Committee will immediately fully \\ninvestigate the matter, objectively analyze the relevant information, identify \\nfacts, and afford the member under review adequate notice and an opportunity \\nto be heard in his or her defence. The Executive will then report to the Board \\nthe fact, its findings and recommendations for the Board’s review and \\nconsideration. The Board may request additional information before making a \\ndetermination and the Executive Committee will seek such information and \\nreport to the Board. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\n3. \\nDecision Phase – The Board will deliberate, make any necessary findings \\nof fact, and make a determination on the matter, which may include the \\nfollowing as the Board determines is warranted: \\na. \\nDiscipline/Reprimand – The Board may issue a written reprimand to \\nthe member, a record of which will be retained on file by the Society \\n(and kept on file for 36 months), and a copy of which will be given to \\nthe member; \\nb. Suspension of Membership – The Board may suspend the member, a \\nrecord of which will be documented and retained on file by the Society \\nand will remain as a permanent record. A written copy of the \\nsuspension will be given to the member; or \\nc. \\nRevocation of Membership – The Board may revoke the membership \\nof the member in the Society, a record of which will be documented \\nand retained on file by the Society and will remain as a permanent \\nrecord. Notification of revocation shall be in writing and given to the \\nmember. \\n4. \\nAppeal Process – Any member may appeal and request a reconsideration \\nof a suspension or revocation and shall forward, in writing, his/her request for \\nappeal and reconsideration to the Board within 10 (ten) days of the issue of the \\nsuspension or revocation. Any request for appeal will include the reasons, \\nand/or rationale for reconsideration of the suspension, or dismissal. The Board \\nwill review the appeal request and a decision will be forwarded to the member \\nwithin 20 days. The decision of the Board will be final and binding and there \\nshall be no further right of appeal. \\nDepending on the severity of the offence, any of the stages may be combined at \\nthe discretion of the Board. \\n[45] \\nFrom the first meeting when the issues surrounding the Creighton Estate came to the \\nattention of the CAS Board, the Board improperly handled the process and this led to significant \\nill will between the parties and various poorly thought-out decisions and events. \\n[46] \\nThe question remains whether these circumstances, taken individually or cumulatively, or \\nthe process followed warrant the intervention of the court. \\n[47] \\nBeginning with the first meeting of the CAS Board which dealt with these matters on \\nMarch 4, 2021, the Board embarked on a process that was not contemplated by its own \\nConstitution. The initial resolution of the Board undertook a process that called for a third party to \\nlook into claims of conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duty. The Executive Committee was \\nto remain the point of contact with the third party. This created a reasonable expectation by the \\nApplicant that this matter would be reviewed by a third party. It was also reasonable for the \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\nApplicant to believe that this would be an independent third party. It seems that all that the Board \\ndid was retain a lawyer to represent it.  \\n[48] \\nThat resolution read as follows: \\nAfter a brief discussion with LD and the board it came to light that a potential \\nconflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duties may have taken place. In the \\ninterest of all it was decided that Laurie recuse herself from the meeting, and any \\nand all duties as a member of the executive and member of the board, while the \\nmatter was investigated more fully as supported by the motion.  \\nCharles Caldwell makes the motion a third party looks into the matter and the \\nexecutive minus Laurie Dillon and Neil Falls is the point of contact. Kathy \\nMcCord seconds. \\n21 in favour, 2 opposed, 0 abstained – Carried \\n \\n[49] \\nWhile the initial discussion surrounding the resolution proposed it as being a “neutral third \\nparty”, this is really of no moment. The CAS Board was proposing to have a third party look into \\nthe matter and there is no circumstance whereby a third party would not otherwise be expected to \\nbe neutral. Effectively, the CAS Board led the Applicant to believe that it was proposing to bring \\nin a third party to investigate. The context did not suggest simply hiring a lawyer to advise the \\nBoard. This would have been done seemingly in the face of its own by-laws, which contemplate \\nsuch an investigation was to be done by the Executive Committee as set out in the above \\nDisciplinary Policy. Importantly, this investigation process is to be done immediately. \\n[50] \\nAs such, from the beginning, the CAS Board undertook a process that did not follow its \\nown by-laws. However, given the realities of the CAS Board and the relationships between the \\nBoard members, this was possibly a conscious decision meant to provide some independence \\nwithin the investigation process. This was the climate in which the Applicant’s expectations were \\ncreated. \\n[51] \\nIt is also relevant that before any party commenced any investigation, a motion was passed \\nrequiring Ms. Dillon to recuse herself from any CAS activities and she was asked to leave the \\nMarch 4, 2021 meeting. This effectively suspended her from all her activities on the Board. I was \\nnot directed to any provision that allows for her immediate suspension without an investigation. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\n[52] \\nMoving forward, the obligation from the Constitution was to proceed “immediately” with \\nthe investigation. In fact, the process followed was anything but immediate. It took nearly five \\nmonths (until July 21, 2021) for the CAS to simply advise that it was looking into hiring a third \\nparty to investigate. At best, that ended up being a lawyer to represent the Board. \\n[53] \\nIt ended up taking the CAS Board six months to finally announce, on August 26, 2021, that \\nit would no longer hire a third party to investigate but that it would follow the Constitution and \\nhave the CAS Executive Committee conduct the investigation. This clearly created a climate of \\nfrustration and lack of trust for the Applicant, who was now going to be investigated by individuals \\nwho had already expressed significant concerns over her actions and those of her family members, \\nand who had required that she recuse herself without an investigation. There was no longer an \\nopportunity for the matter to be investigated by a third party, although the CAS Board had \\ncommitted to doing so by formal resolution on March 4, 2021. \\n[54] \\nThe CAS Board’s decision to finally have the investigation done by the Executive \\nCommittee compounded the Applicant’s mistrust when it allowed members of the Board who were \\nin dispute with the Applicant and Mr. Dillon to continue to be involved in the process. The decision \\nto have members Mike Jensen and Scott Moore be part of the Board’s process when it was known \\nthat the Applicant had filed complaints against them to their real estate broker governing body \\nraises many questions. The CAS Board representative clearly stated in his evidence that those \\ncomplaints, which the CAS determined to be frivolous, form part of the reasons for which the CAS \\nBoard refused to reinstate her membership. However, there is no evidence that the Applicant was \\ngiven notice that this was an issue the Board considered in this matter. \\n[55] \\nFurthermore, the CAS tried to advance the position that neither Mr. Jensen nor Mr. Moore \\nparticipated in the decision-making process because they recused themselves from the ultimate \\ndecision to revoke her membership. However, the minutes of a number of meetings show either \\nMr. Jensen or Mr. Moore being present at various meetings when this matter was discussed, \\nwithout indication that they recused themselves. Regardless, even if they had recused themselves \\nfrom the final vote, they would have had the opportunity to influence the vote throughout. This \\ncourt makes no comment on the need for Mr. Jensen or Mr. Moore to recuse themselves. However, \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nthe evidence of the CAS that they did recuse themselves is not supported by the evidence.  Once \\nagain, the lack of transparency in the decision-making process leaves many unanswered questions. \\n[56] \\nThe absence of proper reasons setting out the facts upon which the CAS Board relied on to \\narrive at its decision raises more questions. Evidence was tendered that although Ms. Blair did not \\nparticipate in the investigation, certain Board members heard second-hand information \\ncontradicting the Applicant’s evidence. One Board member met with Ms. Blair but no information \\nwas given as to what facts that member obtained and how it played a part in the eventual decision. \\nThe Applicant was never given notice of this evidence or an opportunity to respond. \\n[57] \\nThe Board’s failure to follow its Constitution, to undertake a third-party process, and then \\nto reverse course and return to an investigation done by the Executive Committee clearly played a \\nbig part in the Applicant’s mistrust.  \\n[58] \\nThe Board’s actions then led to the Applicant making the poor decision of not participating \\nin the investigation until after her new counsel became involved in November 2021. \\n[59] \\n  As for the remainder of the CAS Board’s decision-making process, it is difficult to \\nunderstand what it was and how decisions were arrived at. At one point, the Applicant was told \\nthat she would have an oral hearing before the Executive Committee. That was changed to a \\nhearing in writing. \\n[60] \\nTurning to the recommendations of the Executive Committee and the decisions of the CAS \\nBoard, there are no meaningful reasons. The CAS Board has chosen to hide behind the letters of \\nits lawyer and did not provide proper reasons setting out the factual findings made, as required by \\nthe Disciplinary Policy. While the relevant provisions of the NFPA do not require reasons for a \\ntermination of membership, the Disciplinary Policy suggests a need to explain what was relied \\nupon and the factual determinations made. That is the process that the CAS decided to adopt when \\nit included the obligation to deliberate, make necessary findings of fact, and make a determination \\non the matter as provided in the Decision Phase of its Disciplinary Policy.  \\n[61] \\nWhen considering the manner in which the CAS Board communicated its decisions – being \\nthrough its lawyers – there is no way for the Applicant to understand if the Executive Committee \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\nfully investigated the matter, objectively analyzed the relevant information, identified facts, and \\nafforded the Applicant adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard on all issues the Board \\nconsidered. To the contrary, there is suggestion that the Board considered factors that it did not \\nidentify as part of its analysis.  \\n[62] \\nThe process the Executive Committee followed and the reasons provided do not allow for \\na meaningful analysis to determine if the CAS Constitution’s Disciplinary Policy was followed \\neither at the Investigative Phase or at the Decision Phase as no meaningful reasons were provided \\nto demonstrate if the CAS Board made the necessary findings of fact required by the disciplinary \\nprocess and if it relied on relevant facts in coming to its decision. \\n[63] \\nThe Divisional Court has weighed in on how the rules of natural justice apply to not-for-\\nprofit corporations, stating in Chu v. Scarborough Hospital Corp. that “the Court will not intervene \\nwith determinations made by a non-share capital corporation in accordance with its by-laws \\nprovided the corporation does not demonstrate bad faith or act contrary to the rules of natural \\njustice.”3  The Divisional Court noted this with approval in London Humane Society (Re), and \\nquoted the following passage from the Charities and Not-for-Profit Administration and  \\nGovernance Handbook:4  \\nNatural justice is a common law development that is intended to protect the \\nprocedural rights of persons. Although it is more usually considered in the \\ncontext of administrative law, the basic premises of natural justice have been \\napplied by the courts to domestic forums and the relationship between members \\nand organizations. Natural justice includes several elements. First, the person \\nwhose rights are to be affected should receive notice of the hearing, if any. \\nSecond, the notice should set out the grounds or reasons for the proposed \\nchange, termination or suspension. Third, the person whose rights are to be \\naffected should have the opportunity to make submissions. Fourth, the decision- \\nmaker or tribunal should, if not unbiased, have an open mind.5 \\n[64] \\nNotably absent from that list is the duty to give reasons. This has been an ongoing debate, \\nwhere some have argued that the duty to give reasons forms part of the principles of natural justice.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n3 (2007), 35 B.L.R.

(4th) 119, at para. 29. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\nThere are many arguments that support such a contention but it would seem that the general \\nconsensus is that there “can” be an obligation to give reasons but that it does not necessarily form \\npart of the rules of natural justice.6 \\n[65] \\nOne of the most compelling arguments in support of the obligation to give reasons is that \\nit facilitates the court’s exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, which in this case has been made a \\nchallenge given the manner in which the CAS Board has communicated its decisions. \\n[66] \\nIn the context of the NFPA, s. 51 dictates that any disciplinary action or termination of \\nmembership must be done “in good faith and in a fair and reasonable manner”.  Specifically, the \\nNFPA requires that a member be “given at least 15 days notice of a disciplinary action or \\ntermination with reasons” (emphasis added).7 When combined with the wording chosen by the \\nCAS in its Disciplinary Policy, which sets out the need to make necessary findings of fact, I am of \\nthe view that the CAS Board was required to give some meaningful written reasons when arriving \\nat its decision. \\n[67] \\nThis court certainly acknowledges that the boards of not-for-profit corporations, such as \\nthe CAS, are not held to a standard of perfection. The Ontario Court of Appeal instructs that \\ndecisions of boards, including those of not-for-profit corporations, should be granted deference, \\nand it is recognized that the directors and officers are in a far better position to make decisions \\naffecting their corporations than a court reviewing the matter after the fact.8 \\n[68] \\nThe Ontario Superior Court has emphasized that the individuals making the decision to \\nterminate a member are “in a better position to judge” than is the court and that, as a result, “the \\ncourt should be reluctant to interfere”.9 The Ontario Superior Court has also adopted an application \\nof the business judgment rule when analyzing the decisions of not-for-profit corporations, namely \\nthat the “board’s decisions will not be subject to microscopic examination and the Court will \\n                                                 \\n \\n6 See e.g. Howard L.

Singh, 2020 ONSC 6116, at para. 58. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\nbe reluctant to interfere and to usurp the board of director’s function in managing the \\ncorporation”.10 Accordingly, the Ontario Superior Court has upheld membership termination \\ndecisions where there is evidence on the record from which the individuals making the decision \\nto terminate “could reach the conclusion they did”, so long as the board acted within the scope of \\nits authority to terminate.11  \\n[69] \\nI have no difficulty adopting the view that deference should be shown to the decisions of \\nthe CAS Board and that it cannot be put to a standard of perfection. However, there are limits as \\nto how far the court can go in these circumstances. My conclusion is that when looking at the \\nprocedural process followed as a whole, in this case the CAS Board followed a process that was \\nfundamentally flawed and did not follow its constitution.  It cannot be upheld for the following \\nreasons: \\na. \\nIt is apparent that the CAS Board was keenly aware that the Applicant’s case was \\nhighly contentious and that from the start of the Board’s implication on March 4, 2021, \\nBoard members were already developing their impressions prior to the investigation \\neven starting to the extent that they proceeded to require recusal from Board activities \\npending the investigation. It is arguable that discipline was already being invoked. \\nb. \\nIt is also apparent that the CAS Board was aware of the need to bring in a third \\nparty to conduct the investigation. The Board’s minutes clearly reflect that a third party \\nbe engaged to look into the matter. The executive committee was only to be a point of \\ncontact. This may have been a result of the views already expressed at the first meeting \\nby many Board members, including some of those who would participate in the \\ninvestigation. It was apparent that there was a need for a third party to investigate. \\nNotwithstanding the provisions of the Disciplinary Policy, this may have been an \\nappropriate circumstance to pass a resolution as it did to involve a third-party \\ninvestigator. This was done at the start, and for some reason, by August 2021, that \\n                                                 \\n \\n10 Hadjor v. Homes First Society, 2010 ONSC 1589, 70 B.L.R. (4th) 101, at para. 49, quoting CW Shareholdings Inc. \\nv. WIC Western International Communications Ltd. (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 755 (Gen. Div.), at p. 774. \\n11 Singh, at paras. 52, 57. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\ndecision was changed for some unexplained reason. In these circumstances, that \\ndecision to reverse course was prejudicial to the Applicant given what had already \\ntranspired. \\nc. \\nThe investigation mandated by the Constitution took far too long to complete. \\nAlthough some of the delay lies at the feet of the Applicant, her actions were influenced \\nby the deficient procedures the Board adopted and the significant mistrust created by \\nremoving the neutral third party from the process. It is the Board that has the obligation \\nunder the Constitution to conduct its investigation immediately and it clearly failed to \\ndo so notwithstanding certain delays attributable to the Applicant. \\nd. \\nBy January 11, 2022, the CAS Board passed a motion for the matter to proceed \\nwith an in-person meeting with the Applicant and the CAS Board. That motion was \\nproposed, seconded, and carried. However, no such meeting took place. The Board \\nrepresentative’s evidence was that the Board elected to proceed in writing, but no \\nexplanation was given as to why the Board did not follow its own resolution to have an \\nin-person meeting. \\ne. \\nThe Constitution contemplates that the Decision Phase will include deliberation, \\nthe making of findings of fact, and the making of a determination of the matter. Such \\nrequirements require at least some reasons to avoid the situation that the Board \\nconsidered important facts or issues for which the individual did not receive notice or \\ndid not have an opportunity to respond to. The Board failed to provide reasons that could \\nexplain the facts upon which it was relying to conclude that the Applicant’s membership \\nmust be terminated. As became apparent during the legal process, the Board relied upon \\nthe complaints the Applicant filed against two of the Board members without notifying \\nthe Applicant that these were factors being taken into consideration to justify the \\ntermination of her membership. This, on its own, was a clear breach of the rules of \\nnatural justice. \\nf. \\nThe Board allowed for those two members to be involved in the process. Proper \\nconsideration should have been given to their participation. The two members’ \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\nparticipation was not transparent to ensure that they did not inappropriately influence \\nthe vote despite the fact that they may have recused themselves from the final vote \\n(although this is not clear from the minutes of November 9, 2021 or April 5, 2022).  \\ng. \\nIn these circumstances, there was clearly an obligation on the Board to provide \\nreasons and, as required by the Constitution, to set out the facts upon which it was \\nrelying. The process was not transparent, and the letters provided by legal counsel for \\nthe Board and the Board’s resolutions failed to provide a suitable level of written reasons \\nto comply with the requirements of the Disciplinary Policy and allow the Applicant to \\nunderstand the basis upon which the decision was being made.  \\n[70] \\nThe Board failed to comply with the Constitution and failed to follow a fair and reasonable \\nprocess as required by s. 51 of the NFPA. Accordingly, I conclude that the CAS Board failed to \\nrespect the principles of natural justice in the flawed disciplinary process it followed. Its decision \\nis fundamentally flawed to the extent that it must be set aside and declared null and void. \\nConflict of Interest \\n[71] \\nSection 41 of the NFPA highlights that a conflict of interest arises when a director is a party \\nto a material contract or transaction with the corporation – in this case the CAS. The conflict of \\ninterest may also arise wherever a board member is a director or officer or has a material interest \\nin a person (including a corporation) that is a party to a material contract or transaction with the \\ncorporation. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that a board member who has a material \\ninterest in a transaction does not seek to influence the vote either by voting on the transaction or \\nattempting to influence the board in respect of that transaction. \\n[72] \\nThe Handbook details the principles for dealing with a conflict of interest among the \\nBoard of Directors. Policy 1.7 states that members of the Board are not to be in a position of \\npersonal gain. If a conflict arises, a director is to abstain from any vote involving the conflict.  \\n[73] \\nThe principles for dealing with conflict of interest read as follows: \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\nThe Director must openly disclose a potential, real or perceived conflict of \\ninterest as soon as the issue arises and before the Board or its Committees deal \\nwith the matter at issue. \\nIf the Director is not certain he/she is in a conflict of interest position, the matter \\nmay be brought before the President, Executive Committee or Board for advice \\nand guidance. \\nIf there is any question or doubt about the existence of a real or perceived conflict, \\nthe Board will determine by vote if a conflict exists. The person potentially in \\nconflict shall be absent from the discussion and vote. \\nIt is the responsibility of other Directors who are aware of a real, potential or \\nperceived conflict of interest on the part of a fellow Director to raise the issue for \\nclarification, first with the Board member and, if still unresolved, with the Board \\nPresident. \\nThe Director must abstain from participation in any discussion on the matter, \\nshall not attempt to personally influence the outcome, shall refrain from voting \\non the matter and unless otherwise decided by the Board, must leave the meeting \\nroom for the duration of any such discussion or vote. \\n[74] \\nThe authorities presented to this court highlight that a conflict of interest arises generally \\nin circumstances where a party has a financial interest in a matter that is before a board of directors, \\nat which time a director must declare the conflict and refrain from influencing the vote either by \\nvoting on the matter or trying to influence how other directors will vote. \\n[75] \\nAt times, legislation will define specifically what a conflict of interest may be in the context \\nof certain legislation. Here, s. 41 of the NFPA has described what constitutes a conflict of interest. \\nFurthermore, the Handbook describes it as being in “a position of personal gain”.  \\n \\n[76] \\nIn certain circumstances, courts have deemed the interest of a close personal friend as being \\nsufficient to warrant action by the director in question. In one case, negotiations involving a close \\npersonal friend of one of the directors made the transaction “suspect”.12 It would not be difficult \\nto extend that analysis to a family member. \\n[77] \\nHowever, what is clear from the NFPA and Policy 1.7 is that a conflict of interest applies \\nwhere a director is a party to a material contract or transaction that is before the board or is in a \\n                                                 \\n \\n12 Exide Canada Inc. v. Hilts (2005), 11 B.L.R. (4th) 311 (Ont. S.C.), at para. 11. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\nposition of personal gain in respect of a matter that comes before the board. At that point, the \\nmember must take the positive steps set out in the statute and in Policy 1.7. \\n[78] \\nIn the present case, the notion of conflict of interest has clearly been misinterpreted by the \\nCAS Board. There is no material contract or transaction before the Board upon which the Applicant \\ncould have a conflict of interest. In this vein, the CAS Board seems to have misunderstood that the \\nCAS is simply a beneficiary under the Creighton Estate and they are only to receive whatever the \\nCAS is entitled to receive under the last Will of Mr. Creighton. There was no transaction before \\nthe CAS Board that requires a vote of any kind. At some point, the CAS Board may be called upon \\nto decide what it will do with the funds it receives from the Creighton Estate, but nothing of the \\nsort was applicable in the present case. All of the transactions took place outside the realm of the \\nCAS and its decision-making process.  \\n[79] \\nAs there was no material contract or transaction before the CAS Board, the Applicant had \\nno conflict of interest to declare. Even for a perceived conflict to exist, it must relate to the business \\nof the CAS. I pause at this point to highlight that there were optics to the series of transactions in \\nwhich the Dillon family was involved, and these are more relevant when considering the \\nApplicant’s fiduciary obligations to the Board, as addressed below. However, when it comes to a \\nconflict of interest as set out in the NFPA or Policy 1.7, none existed.     \\n[80] \\nAs stated, the CAS was simply the beneficiary of a substantial portion of the Creighton \\nEstate. When considering the role of Mr. Dillon, the transaction that involved him took place \\nbetween the Estate Trustee (Ms. Blair) and himself. Any commission paid to Mr. Dillon or the \\nbrokerage transpired separately from the CAS. The CAS did not have the right to weigh in on \\nMr. Dillon’s right to charge a commission for the initial sale of the Creighton property or on the \\nsale price or on the decision that the property not be put on the market. The CAS did not have the \\nright to require that the Estate Trustee put the property on the open market. While the CAS may \\nhave rights as a beneficiary to complain about the liquidation of the Creighton Estate assets by the \\nEstate Trustee, just like any other beneficiary, no such transaction was brought to the CAS Board \\nfor consideration. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\n[81] \\nThere is no evidence that the CAS Board made any complaints as a beneficiary to Ms. Blair \\nthat she failed to list the property for sale or that she should not have paid a commission to \\nMr. Dillon. Had the CAS Board made such a complaint, whereby the commission to be received \\nby Mr. Dillon was in question, that could have been a legitimate conflict of interest. The CAS \\nBoard’s vote to challenge the manner in which the Creighton property was sold could have given \\nrise to a conflict for the Applicant. However, there was no such item before the Board that could \\nhave given rise to a conflict. \\n[82] \\nThe relevant transaction in this case was between Mr. Dillon or the brokerage for which he \\nworked and the Creighton Estate. The Estate Trustee’s insistence on paying a commission for \\nMr. Dillon’s work may or may not have been warranted, but it was not a material contract or \\ntransaction involving the CAS. Furthermore, the evidence shows that it was as a result of \\nMr. Dillon’s efforts that the parties found out that the road allowance could be opened and, \\neffectively, he found Mr. Baird as the eventual purchaser. He was paid for his services just like \\nany other real estate broker would have been paid. \\n[83] \\nAccordingly, the Executive Committee’s conclusion that the Applicant was in a conflict of \\ninterest is fundamentally flawed and cannot stand. It is wrong both in fact and in law and the \\nBoard’s conclusion that the Applicant was in a conflict of interest is set aside and declared null \\nand void. \\nFiduciary Duty \\n[84] \\nThe Respondent argues that the Applicant breached her fiduciary duty to the CAS when \\nshe failed to disclose the Dillon family’s personal interest and involvement in the sale and resale \\nof the Creighton property. This allegation is possible as it does not rely on a conflict of interest.   \\n[85] \\nCanadian courts have provided the following direction on fiduciary duties: \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\na. \\nA fiduciary is “under a duty to act in a completely selfless manner for the sole \\nbenefit” of the beneficiary of the fiduciary.13  \\nb. \\nThe duties of trust and loyalty include an obligation to scrupulously avoid placing \\noneself in a possible or potential conflict of interest.14  \\nc. \\nThere should be careful avoidance of any personal pursuit inconsistent with the best \\ninterests of the beneficiary of the fiduciary duty.15 \\nd. \\nA fiduciary must not put herself in a position where her interests and duty conflict, \\nlest the person holding the fiduciary duty be swayed by her own interest rather than her \\nduty.16  \\n[86] \\nIt is not necessary for a director of a not-for-profit corporation to have acted in bad faith \\nor for actual wrongdoing to be established in order to make out a breach of fiduciary duty. The \\nOntario Superior Court recently held that trustees of a not-for-profit board breached their fiduciary \\nduties when they failed to disclose a conflict of interest in respect of a financial transaction \\ninvolving the trustees, even though there was no malice or bad faith: “a fiduciary duty ‘might be \\ndeparted from in many cases, without any breach of morality, without any wrong being inflicted, \\nand without any consciousness of wrong-doing’”.17   \\n[87] \\nMost relevant to this case is “the fundamental rule of equity that a person in a fiduciary \\ncapacity must not make a profit out of his trust which is part of the wider rule that a trustee must \\nnot place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict.”18 \\n                                                 \\n \\n13 Hodgkinson v.

The Estate Trustee chose to sell the property for the same amount that \\nMr. Creighton previously wanted for his home from his neighbour. It was sold for the same amount \\nthat was offered to his neighbour and this was done with the knowledge that the property had better \\nredevelopment potential than was initially believed. The Estate Trustee chose not to list the \\nproperty for sale. Mr. Dillon gave the proper advice that the only way to know the true value was \\nto list the property for sale. The only evidence is that Estate Trustee insisted that Mr. Dillon receive \\na commission on the first transaction. It is safe to assume that any real estate agent acting on the \\nfirst transaction from the Creighton Estate to Mr. and Mrs. Baird would have been entitled to and \\nwould have received a commission. Mr. and Ms. Dillon were free to represent Mr. Baird on the \\nsecond transaction and not charge a commission. There is no breach of trust in those actions.  Any \\ndispute that the CAS Board may have with those transactions are those of a beneficiary and not as \\na party to a transaction involving the CAS. The Board’s dispute lies with the Estate Trustee. \\n                                                 \\n \\n19 London Humane Society, at paras. 19-20. \\n20 Simms, at p. 461. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 26 \\n \\n \\n[92] \\nAs previously stated, the Applicant was not directly a party to those transactions, and the \\ntransactions certainly did not involve the CAS, despite the fact that the corporation had a beneficial \\ninterest. \\n[93] \\nWhat is most relevant is that the Applicant’s position as a Board member of the CAS had \\nnothing to do with her family’s involvement in the sale and resale of the Creighton property. She \\ndid not become involved as a result of her role with the CAS, whereby she could put her own \\ninterests ahead of those of the CAS. Effectively, the CAS had no interest in either the first or \\nsecond transaction – only the Estate Trustee did. The CAS’s beneficial interest is too far removed.  \\n[94] \\nWhen dealing with fiduciary interests, the Respondent relies on authorities that involve \\ntransactions with a corporation to which a fiduciary obligation is owed: \\na. \\nIn Cataraqui Cemetery Company, the trustees obtained personal benefits from the \\ncorporation in the form of grave plots and future discounts on the maintenance of grave \\nplots. \\nb. \\nIn Simms,  the respondent was acting for the developers of an investment and failed \\nto disclose that relationship to his client. \\nc. \\nIn Exide Canada, directors of the corporation caused the corporation to enter into \\na material contract with a third party without disclosing their close relationship with that \\nthird party. \\n[95] \\nWhile Ms. Dillon stands in a fiduciary relationship with the CAS, none of the transactions \\nraised by the Respondent involved the CAS. No vote was taken by the CAS Board to authorize \\nany transaction. The CAS was simply a recipient of the liquidated estate assets. \\n[96] \\nAccordingly, Ms. Dillon did not make profit out of her trust. She did not place herself in a \\nposition where her duty and her interest could conflict. The Creighton property had to be sold.  \\nMr. Dillon provided valuable services to the Creighton Estate in determining a fair price with the \\ncaveat that it would only be upon listing the property for sale that the true value could be \\ndetermined. I accept that he could have chosen not to take a commission in these circumstances. \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 27 \\n \\n \\nArguably, it was thanks to Mr. Dillon’s efforts that the property was not sold to Mr. White for \\n$240,000. But for Mr. Dillon’s role and efforts, the CAS may have ended up with a smaller \\nbeneficial interest. \\n[97] \\nEffectively, the CAS seeks to blame the Applicant and Mr. Dillon for Ms. Blair’s refusal \\nto list the property and seek out the maximum value. The fault for this does not lie with the \\nApplicant.    \\n[98] \\nI am of the view that the CAS Board erred when it concluded that the Applicant breached \\nher fiduciary duty by allowing Mr. Dillon to provide realtor services to the Creighton Estate and \\nby allowing her father to purchase the Creighton property for the price that Ms. Blair wanted to \\nsell the property for. These are the fundamental complaints, and they do not place the Applicant \\nin conflict with her fiduciary duty as Co-President of the CAS Board. The interest of the Board \\nwas to receive its beneficial share and the Creighton property needed to be sold. I am of the view \\nthat Ms. Dillon, through Mr. Dillon, did exactly what she was supposed to do when Mr. Dillon \\nadvised Ms. Blair as to how she could determine the true market value of the property. Ms. Blair \\nchose not to follow that advice. \\n[99] \\nAfter that, Mr. Dillon received a commission, just as any other agent would have, by \\nproviding valuable advice to Ms. Blair and by finding a purchaser to buy the property for the \\namount she was seeking. How can the Applicant or Mr. Dillon be found to have benefited from \\nMs. Dillon’s trust relationship with the CAS? Assuming that Ms. Dillon can be found to have \\nbenefitted from Mr. Dillon’s commission, he was simply paid fair value for the services he \\nrendered. Those benefits did not result from Ms. Dillon’s fiduciary obligations to the CAS. \\n[100] Turning to the second transaction, the profit made by Mr. and Mrs. Baird is at the heart of \\nthe CAS Board’s complaints. The complaint is that Mr. Baird received the higher price that should \\nhave been paid to the Creighton Estate. However, the Estate Trustee did not see fit to engage in \\nthe process that she was told would yield the true value for the Creighton property. There is no \\nfault attributed to any party for this decision as there is no known complaint by any party.  \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1858 (CanLII)\\nPage: 28 \\n \\n \\n \\n[101] The court appreciates that there is proximity to all parties involved in a series of \\ntransactions that take place in a closely knit community. However, a breach of fiduciary duty \\ninvolves profiting from a trust and putting one’s interests ahead of the beneficiary of the trust \\nobligations. In the present case, the CAS was not prejudiced by the fact that Mr. Dillon provided \\nservices to the Creighton Estate in the form of valuable information and found a buyer for the \\nCreighton property at the price that the Estate Trustee was seeking. In addition, the Applicant did \\nnot profit from the trust. The fact that a commission was paid to the brokerage is a normal \\ntransaction for services rendered and the CAS was not prejudiced by it. While the brokerage may \\nhave chosen to forego a commission, it was not required to do so and there is no evidence that \\nanother agent would have done so in similar circumstances. The payment of the commission does \\nnot flow from the trust obligations of the Applicant.  \\n[102] Accordingly, there is no basis in law for a finding that Ms. Dillon breached her fiduciary \\nduties to the CAS and the CAS’s finding in this regard is set aside and declared null and void. \\nCONCLUSION \\n[103]  For the reasons set out herein, the court concludes that the CAS Board breached the rules \\nof natural justice in the disciplinary process involving the Applicant and in the manner in which \\nits decision was rendered. The Applicant was not in a conflict of interest pursuant to the applicable \\nlegislation nor the Constitution of the CAS. Furthermore, there was no breach of fiduciary duty. \\nThe cross-application is dismissed.  \\n[104] Accordingly, the CAS Board’s decision to revoke the Applicant’s membership is set aside \\nand her membership shall be reinstated. The court makes no comment on the Applicant’s status as \\na director or officer of the CAS. \\nCOSTS \\n[105] The parties are encouraged to resolve the issue of costs. If they are unable to do so, they \\nmay make written costs submissions no longer than five pages excluding all attachments.

O-5 (the SOIA) violated s. 7 of the Canadian \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms and was unconstitutional, and of no force and effect pursuant to \\ns. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. \\n[2] \\nOn September 28, 2023, an oral ruling was provided denying the application with the \\nunderstanding that written reasons would be provided following the completion of the trial. These \\nare those reasons.  \\n[3] \\nOn November 22, 2023, following an eight-week jury trial, Cameron Ortis was found \\nguilty of Counts one to four being offences contrary to s. 14(1) of the SOIA, namely that Cameron \\nOrtis did on three separate occasions intentionally and without authority communicate special \\noperational information and on one occasion attempted to do so, to four different individuals. He \\nwas also convicted of two Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, offences, namely on \\nCount five (a breach of trust contrary to s. 122) and Count six (unauthorized use of a computer \\ncontrary to s. 342.1(1)).  \\n[4] \\nSection 14(1) of the SOIA provides as follows: “Every person permanently bound to \\nsecrecy commits an offence who, intentionally and without authority, communicates or confirms \\nspecial operational information.” \\n[5] \\nThe application centred around the proposition that the words “without authority” in \\ns. 14(1) of the SOIA were too vague. \\nFactual background: \\n[6] \\nAt the time of the commission of the offences Cameron Ortis held a high position in the \\nnational security division of the RCMP. He was the Director of Operations Research, a unit or \\ndivision of the RCMP that he in fact created. At the time of his arrest in September 2019 he held \\nthe position of the Director of the National Intelligence Coordination Centre. \\n[7] \\nThe Operations Research unit had unrestricted access to the most classified top-secret \\ninformation available to the RCMP, information that was shared by other domestic and \\ninternational agencies. The members of Operations Research would access very highly classified \\ninformation from Canada’s top-secret network, take this information, analyze it, and prepare \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\nbriefing materials. The briefs or materials would then be shared with senior decision makers in the \\nRCMP with a view to addressing threats to Canada’s national security. \\n[8] \\nPart of the work of Operations Research included Transnational Organized Crime. In 2014-\\n2015 the RCMP, as well as their counterparts in Australia and the United States, were investigating \\na company called Phantom Secure. This was because of the predominant use of encrypted cell \\nphones or PGP devices by organized crime in their respective jurisdictions. Phantom Secure was \\nsupplying these devices on an international scale. Vincent Ramos was the head of Phantom Secure \\nand one of his known associates was Kapil Judge.  \\n[9] \\nCount one specified that Cameron Ortis communicated special operational information \\nintentionally and without authority to Vincent Ramos. Some of the information he communicated \\nto Ramos included:  \\ni. \\nThat Phantom Secure was the subject of international investigations. \\nii. \\nThat a person who approached Kapil Judge at the Vancouver International Airport \\nwas an undercover operator. \\niii. \\nInformation the RCMP had learned about Phantom Secure’s technical infrastructure.  \\niv. \\nThat Ramos was going to be under surveillance by the RCMP out of British \\nColumbia.  \\nv. \\nThat law enforcement knew about his servers in Florida.  \\nvi. \\nThat his financial transactions were being monitored by FINTRAC. \\n[10] \\nCount two specified that Cameron Ortis communicated special operational information \\nintentionally and without authority to Salim Henareh. Count three specified that he communicated \\nspecial operational information to Muhammad Ashraf. Count four specified that he attempted to \\ncommunicate special operational information to Farzam Mehdizadeh.  \\n[11] \\nHenareh, Ashraf, and Mehdizadeh were believed to be connected to a transnational \\ncriminal organization involved in large-scale money laundering controlled by Altaf Khanani. \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n[12] \\nOn Count two, some of the special operational information communicated to Salem \\nHenareh included: \\ni. \\nThat FINTRAC had an ongoing probe targeting his business activities and partners.  \\nii. \\nThe RCMP was engaged in an intelligence operation (project Oryx) concerning his \\nbusiness activities, using FINTRAC data.  \\niii. \\nHe was provided a FINTRAC disclosure summary and over 300 pages of FINTRAC \\nreporting.  \\n[13] \\nOn Count three, some of the special operational information communicated to Muhammad \\nAshraf included:  \\ni. \\nAn excerpt from a CIAG report disclosing that the Five Eyes were working together \\nto target the Khanani money laundering network.  \\nii. \\nThat Ashraf and Mohammad Yousef were of particular interest to RCMP agents in \\nCanada.  \\niii. \\nAn excerpt of a project Oryx investigation report disclosing that Khanani, Ashraf and \\nhis son were the subjects of an investigation.  \\niv. \\nA covering letter advising Ashraf that the information Ortis had would be useful – to \\nhim and several others including Khanani and that he would like to get in touch with \\nKhanani. \\n[14] \\nCount four was an attempt to communicate special operational information to Farzam \\nMehdizadeh through his son Masih Mehdizadeh. Some of the information that Cameron Ortis \\nproposed to communicate included:  \\ni. \\nThat a named person in Montréal was working at the DEA as an informant. \\nii. \\nThat the DEA and RCMP were targeting Mehdizadeh and his company with the goal \\nof getting Khanani.  \\n[15] \\nAt his trial Cameron Ortis testified over several days. The thrust of the defence was that he \\nacted with authority when communicating the special operational information to the individuals \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\nspecified in Counts one to four. By virtue of his role in the RCMP he could do what he was doing \\nas part of an elaborate undercover operation undertaken at the request of a foreign agency. \\n[16] \\n In very broad terms, he testified that the actions he took were at the behest of a counterpart \\nwho worked for one of our partner countries in the Five Eyes. The stated goal of the operation was \\nto entice specific targets onto an encrypted email platform where their communications could be \\nintercepted as a means of collecting intelligence that would be fed back into the Five Eyes system \\nincluding the RCMP. He also stipulated that he could not advise any of his superiors of the \\noperation because of the existence of a suspected mole within the RCMP. \\n[17] \\nThe ultimate issue at trial on the s. 14 offences concerned whether Cameron Ortis acted \\nwithout authority. The bulk of the evidence presented by both sides was directed at that very issue. \\nTo sustain a conviction the jury had to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he did not have \\nthe authority to do what he did. \\nSummary of the defence argument: \\n[18] \\nCounsel on behalf of the Applicant argued that the term “authority” within s. 14 of the \\nSOIA was too vague, as it failed to sufficiently delineate any area of risk and could not provide \\neither fair notice to citizens, or a limitation to law enforcement regarding the exercise of their \\ndiscretion. The term was thus unconstitutionally vague and therefore a breach of the Applicant’s \\ns. 7 Charter rights and should be found to be of no force and effect.   \\n[19] \\nThe highlights of the defence submissions were as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 That an accused acted “without authority” was an essential element of the offence under \\ns. 14. It must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. They further argued that the Crown \\nwould have to establish that the accused knew that he was acting without authority.  \\n\\uf0b7 The term “authority” was not defined anywhere in the Act. Section 14 must be \\ninterpreted within the context of the purpose of the SOIA. The fundamental purpose of \\nthe legislation was to address Canada’s national security concerns. \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Section 14 served to criminalize a specific act, being the intentional unauthorized \\ncommunication of special operational information by anyone permanently bound to \\nsecrecy. To satisfy the constitutional requirement for precision it must “delineate a risk \\nzone for criminal sanction”. This is to provide guidance to citizens and law enforcement \\nofficers. \\n\\uf0b7 “Persons permanently bound to secrecy” covered a wide array of individuals. For \\nexample, it includes current and former members of both the National Security and \\nIntelligence Review Agency and Committee of Parliamentarians. It could also apply to \\npersons other than federal government employees. \\n\\uf0b7 Given that the term “authority” was not defined in the legislation, statutory \\ninterpretation mandated that the goal was to determine the intention of Parliament by \\nconsidering the words in context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense within \\nthe framework of the object of the Act. \\n\\uf0b7 In R. v. Audet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 171, the Supreme Court considered the term “position \\nof authority” and provided the following possible meanings: a) the right to command \\npower (recognized or unrecognized); b) superiority of merit or seductiveness that \\ncompels unconstrained obedience, respect, trust; c) the power or right to enforce \\nobedience; and d) the power to influence the conduct and actions of others. \\n\\uf0b7 The definitions in the Audet decision did not assist in determining who had the \\n“authority” in s. 14 of the SOIA. The legislation did not specify who might have \\nauthority, or who might legally exercise authority; it left open-ended questions on \\nassessing who had authority. This lack of clarity went to the mens rea of the offence, \\nas it spoke to an accused’s mental state at the time they would have communicated the \\nspecial operational information.  \\n\\uf0b7 O’Neill v. Canada (Attorney General) (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 241 (S.C.), was referenced \\nfor the proposition that stand-alone terms such as “secret official”, “official” and \\n“authorized” were undefined in the SOIA. The presiding judge in that case ruled that \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\nthe impugned sections were standardless with the result that they were facially \\nmeaningless. It was submitted that that finding was applicable to the case at bar; the \\nterm “authority” in the SOIA was also standardless and facially meaningless which \\nsupported the proposition that it was too vague.  \\n\\uf0b7 The SOIA used the term “without lawful authority” and “without authority” depending \\non the specific section being referenced. The presumption against tautology dictated \\nthat the terms “lawful authority” and “authority” as utilized in the Act must mean \\ndifferent things. The lack of a discernable difference between the two terms further \\nbuttressed the argument that the word “authority” was too vague in s. 14. \\n\\uf0b7 Section 7 of the Charter provided that “ everyone has the right to life, liberty and \\nsecurity of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with \\nthe principles of fundamental justice.” The possibility of imprisonment (the deprivation \\nof liberty) if convicted of the offence set out in s. 14 established the deprivation element \\nof s. 7. The vagueness caused by the lack of a definition for the word “authority” was \\nsuch that individuals, especially those not bound by government policy guidelines, \\nwere not able to determine, by reading s. 14, when they were approaching the \\nboundaries of criminal sanction to properly evaluate whether conduct could constitute \\na criminal act. \\n\\uf0b7 A reasonable hypothetical could include circumstances where an individual who was \\npermanently bound to secrecy, and had sought and received authorization from a \\nsuperior, could still be prosecuted if the Crown took the position that the superior was \\nnot allowed to grant such authority. This further demonstrated the vagueness of the \\nsection.  \\n\\uf0b7 This violation could not be saved by s. 1. The use of the undefined word “authority” in \\ns. 14 failed to offer an intelligible standard for citizens and law enforcement officials \\nregarding their risk zone for criminal sanctions so that the Oakes test need not be \\nundertaken in respect of this s. 7 breach. \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n[20] \\nThe Applicant concluded his submissions by proposing that if the court were to find that \\ns. 14 was not unconstitutionally vague then a definition or meaning would have to be attributed to \\n“authority” for the purposes of instructing the jury and defending the charges.  \\nSummary of the Crown’s argument: \\n[21] \\nThe Crown in general terms submitted that the vagueness motion proceeded on an incorrect \\nassumption, namely that the Crown was obligated to prove that the accused knew that his \\ncommunication of special operational information was unauthorized.  \\n[22] \\nThey submitted that the element of “without authority” was part of the actus reus, and not \\nthe mens rea of the offence. The mental element of the offence to be proven beyond a reasonable \\ndoubt was that a person permanently bound to secrecy communicated special operational \\ninformation intentionally and nothing more.  \\n[23] \\nSection 14 was part of a comprehensive scheme to protect information. It was meant to \\nsafeguard information in the hands of persons permanently bound to secrecy, not its dissemination. \\nThe term “authority” in that context was derived from the duties and responsibilities attendant to \\nthat person’s role as a person permanently bound to secrecy. It meant a state of being authorized \\n– having official capacity, the power or right to act.  \\n[24] \\nThe Crown, as a preliminary matter at the time of the hearing, argued that the application \\nshould only be heard following the completion of the trial. This argument was rejected given the \\ndetailed factual admissions offered by the Applicant. I concluded that given the admissions, a full \\nevidentiary record was not required to adjudicate the issue. That said, the full evidentiary record \\nfollowing eight weeks of trial buttressed my conclusion that the application should be dismissed. \\n[25] \\nThe highlights of the Crown’s argument on the issue of the constitutionality of the section \\nwere as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 Section 14 was directed at a particular group of persons, not the public at large. \\nSpecifically, those persons who are permanently bound to secrecy. It applied to a \\nparticular type of information, being special operational information. The offence was \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\none of general intent. The mens rea was that it be communicated intentionally. The \\nCrown need not prove an accused knew that his actions were illegal. A mistaken belief \\nthat one had authority was a mistake of law and not a defence. \\n\\uf0b7 R. v. Forster, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 339, and R. v. MacDonald, 2014 SCC 3, [2014] 1 S.C.R. \\n37, were provided as analogous cases standing for the proposition that ignorance of \\nthe law did not constitute a defence. In each of these decisions a mistaken belief by \\nan accused person in respect of the legal consequences of one’s deliberate actions did \\nnot furnish a defence to a criminal charge. A mistake of law did not furnish a defence. \\nIn the context of s. 14 of the SOIA a mistake as to the scope of one’s authority was a \\nmistake of law and did not provide a defence. \\n\\uf0b7 Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence including Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., \\n[1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031, R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, \\nand R. v. Levkovic, 2013 SCC 25, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 204, were cited with respect to the \\nconcept of vagueness and a s. 7 challenge. The key principles stipulated included:  \\na) A law must sufficiently delineate an area of risk. It will be found \\nunconstitutionally vague if it lacked precision to the extent that it provided \\ninsufficient guidance for legal debate. \\nb) An individual need not know with certainty whether a particular course of \\nconduct can result in a conviction; only the essential elements of an offence \\nmust be ascertainable in advance. \\nc) In deciding whether a statute provided sufficient guidance for legal debate, a \\nlaw must be examined both in its text and context. A court must exhaust its \\ninterpretive function before concluding that a law is unconstitutionally \\nvague. \\nd) Courts must be permitted to interpret and apply the words of the statute \\ngiving “sensible meaning to the terms of the section.” \\ne) A deferential approach should be taken in relation to legislative enactments. \\nf) Reasonable hypotheticals played no role in the vagueness analysis. \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The words of the statute must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical \\nand ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act \\nand the intention of Parliament. The text should not be read in isolation but in light of \\nthe broader statutory scheme: R. v. McColman, 2023 SCC 8, 478 D.L.R. (4th) 577, at \\npara. 35. \\n\\uf0b7 The purpose of s. 14 of the SOIA was to provide those entrusted with the most vital \\nspecial operational information with the tools they need to protect the information. It \\nwas also meant to provide assurances to intelligence partners with whom they share \\ninformation that it would remain protected indefinitely, that the unauthorized sharing \\nwas criminalized and that those who undertook the operations were protected.  \\n\\uf0b7 When considering the term “authority” and s. 14, it must be understood that it fell \\nunder a discrete part of the SOIA and only applied to persons who were permanently \\nbound to secrecy. It dealt with offences that could only be committed by government \\nofficials, and persons designated by government officials, who, by virtue of their \\nduties, had access to special operational information, and for that reason they were \\npermanently bound to secrecy. The wording of s. 14 was consistent with the \\nlegislative purpose, to permanently bind persons to secrecy who had access to highly \\nsensitive operational information and criminalize the unauthorized disclosure thereof. \\n\\uf0b7 The meaning of authority must be considered in its “grammatical and ordinary sense \\nharmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of \\nParliament”. Implied in the definition was that persons permanently bound to secrecy \\nare bound by rules, policies, and a command structure. “Without authority” would \\nmean without the official capacity, power or right to act. The possible sources of \\nauthority would be the duties of the official position, the policies and rules (including \\nstatutory authority, judicial authority and guidelines) governing the position, and \\nwhen it came from persons having authority (superiors). \\n\\uf0b7 The Crown then provided examples of sources specific to the Applicant, including the \\nduties of his official position as Director of Operations Research, the rules and policies \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\nthat governed that position, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s policies on \\ngovernment security, the RCMP security manuals and guidelines for the security of \\ninformation.  \\n\\uf0b7 It was also submitted that there was a clear distinction between the terms “without \\nlawful authority” and “without authority” in the context of the SOIA. One definition \\napplied specifically to persons permanently bound to secrecy, the other to persons \\noutside the official realm with no official mandate and thus no functional authority.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Crown concluded by submitting that the duties of the Director of Operations \\nResearch, and policies applicable to the Applicant as a person permanently bound to \\nsecrecy defined the scope of authority the Applicant would have had to deal with \\nspecial operational information. The evidence at trial would clearly demonstrate that \\nhe acted without authority, thus establishing that the term was not vague in the context \\nof this section of the Act. \\n[26] \\nThe Crown proposed that an appropriate jury instruction as to the meaning of authority \\nwould be that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no authority for the \\nApplicant to communicate special operational information as alleged in the indictment. \\nFurthermore, authority meant that the accused needed to have some official capacity, power or \\nright to disclose the information to the persons named in the indictment. The jury would further \\nhave to be instructed as to the possible sources for the authority to do so. \\nConclusion: \\n[27] \\nAfter considering the arguments of both the Crown and defence counsel I concluded that \\nthe application to declare s. 14 unconstitutional should be dismissed. I did so for the following \\nreasons: \\na) The section was examined in accordance with the principles of statutory \\ninterpretation mandated by the governing jurisprudence that “the words of an Act \\nare to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\nharmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of \\nParliament.” \\nb) The SOIA came into force on December 24, 2001, as part of the omnibus Anti-\\nterrorism Act, S.C. 2001, c. 41. It replaced the Official Secrets Act. The debates in \\nParliament at the time of the enactment of s. 14 of the SOIA support the proposition \\nthat its purpose was to provide those entrusted with special operational information \\nwith the tools required to protect the information, and to provide assurances to \\nintelligence partners with whom we share information that it would remain \\nprotected indefinitely, that unauthorized sharing was criminalized and that those \\nwho undertake the operations would be protected.  \\nc) Section 14 comes under the heading “Special Operational Information and Persons \\nPermanently Bound to Secrecy” which covers ss. 8 to 15 of the SOIA. The section \\nis directed at a specified class of people, those who are permanently bound to \\nsecrecy. The words “without authority” must be considered in that specific context \\nand when doing so their meaning is implicit. The words taken contextually are not \\nvague; they can only mean the power or right to act. You either have the authority \\nto communicate the information or you do not. \\nd) I agree with the Crown that the “without authority” element of the offence goes to \\nthe actus reus and not the mens rea. For the section to have any value or meaning \\nwith regards to protecting special operational information this is the only \\ninterpretation plausible. \\ne) The terms “without authority” and “without lawful authority” in the SOIA are \\ndifferentiated by who the sections are meant to capture. “Without authority” applies \\nto persons permanently bound to secrecy specifically. “Without lawful authority” \\napplies to persons who are not. \\nf) \\nThe sources of authority would come from the duties and responsibilities associated \\nwith the person who is permanently bound to secrecy’s position, including the \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\nnature of their work and job description. It could also come from a superior who \\nhas the power to grant the authority. \\ng) The implicit definition attributable to the term “authority” in the context of s. 14 is \\nreasonably straightforward and it is the power or right to act. \\n[28] \\nThe evidence presented at the trial further assisted in arriving at this conclusion. The \\nwitnesses who stood in comparable positions to the Applicant were well-positioned to describe \\nwhat authority they did and did not have, and from where those sources of authority originated. \\n[29] \\n Finally, the instructions provided to the jury at the end of the trial on the issue of “without \\nauthority” were derived from the evidence, and from what I concluded to be the appropriate \\ninterpretation of s. 14 of the SOIA. The jury instructions were as follows: \\na) The Crown must establish that Cameron Ortis communicated special operational \\ninformation without authority beyond a reasonable doubt.  \\nb) The definition of “without authority” or “authority” applicable to s. 14 of the Security \\nof Information Act would be as follows: it is the power or right to act. In the context \\nof this case it would be the power or right to communicate special operational \\ninformation to the individuals set out in the indictment. \\nc) In this case the power or right to act would have to be derived from the accused’s \\nemployment position while at the RCMP, at the time that the special operational \\ninformation was communicated or disclosed. \\nd) In this case Cameron Ortis was the Director of Operations Research. Some of the \\nmatters that you would consider regarding the sources of authority would include: 1) \\nthe duties and responsibilities associated with his position including the nature of his \\nwork, the mission, and his job description; 2) the policies governing a civilian member \\nof the RCMP, and the specific responsibilities of a person permanently bound to \\nsecrecy; and 3) the authority one could obtain from someone else, a superior for \\nexample or the originator of a document.  \\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\ne) You should know that Cameron Ortis’s belief that he had the authority is not relevant \\nto your determination. He either had the authority or he did not. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n[30] \\nThe words “without authority” in s. 14 were therefore found not to be vague and the \\napplication for a declaration that the section was unconstitutional and a breach of the Applicant’s \\ns. 7 Charter right was accordingly dismissed. \\n_______________________ \\nJustice Robert Maranger \\n \\n \\nReleased: March 28, 2024\\n2024 ONSC 1860 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nCITATION: R v.

A.31. \\nOVERVIEW \\n[1] \\nThe Applicant, Langs Community Development Corporation (“LCDC”) seeks a \\ndeclaration that the property it owns, at 1145 Concession Road, Cambridge, Ontario (the \\n\"Property\"), is exempt from municipal property tax under the provision of s. 3(1)(12) iii of \\nthe Assessment Act, (the “Act”) and has been so exempt since the 2018 taxation year;  \\n[2] \\nLangs Farm Village Association (“Langs”) operates a community hub at 1145 Concession \\nRoad, in Cambridge, Ontario. Langs was incorporated in 1987 and became a registered \\ncharity in 1991. \\n[3] \\nIn 2007, Langs incorporated a separate legal entity, LCDC, to purchase the Property. Later, \\nthe community hub was built on the Property.  \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n[4] \\nLCDC was incorporated as a non profit, non share capital corporation, and became a \\nregistered charity in 2017. \\n[5] \\nSection 3(1)(12)iii of the Assessment Act states: \\n3 (1) All real property in Ontario is liable to assessment and taxation, subject to the \\nfollowing exemptions from taxation: \\nCharitable institutions \\n \\n12.  Land owned, used and occupied by, \\niii.  any charitable, non-profit philanthropic corporation organized for the \\nrelief of the poor if the corporation is supported in part by public funds. \\n[6] \\nThe Respondent opposes the application on the basis that LCDC does not meet the statutory \\nrequirements to qualify for the exemption. Specifically, that LCDC is not organized for the \\nrelief of the poor, and that it is not supported in part by public funds.  \\n[7] \\nLCDC argues that the exemption applies for the following reasons: \\na) LCDC owns, and occupies the Property; \\nb) LCDC uses the Property to fulfill its objectives and purposes; \\nc) LCDC is supported in part by public funds; and \\nd) LCDC was organized for the relief of the poor and provides relief to the poor. \\n[8] \\nIn the alternative, LCDC argues that it shares an identity in patrimony with Langs, and that \\nLangs is organized for the relief of the poor and is supported largely by public funds, and \\nLangs would be tax exempt if it owned the property directly. Therefore, by virtue of the \\nshared identity, LCDC is entitled to tax exempt status. \\n[9] \\nThe Respondent disagrees that there is a shared identity in patrimony between Langs and \\nLCDC, and argues that in any event, neither LCDC nor Langs are “organized for the relief \\nof the poor”. \\nISSUES  \\nThe parties agree on the following facts: \\n[10] \\nThe Board of dDirectors of Langs caused LCDC to be incorporated for the purpose of \\npurchasing the Property.  \\n[11] \\nLCDC is a charitable non profit philanthropic corporation. \\n[12] \\nIt is agreed that LCDC owns, uses and occupies the Property. \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n[13] \\nIt is agreed that Langs is supported in large part by public funds (but not that LCDC is \\nsupported in part by public funds). \\n[14] \\nIt is agreed that only the following three questions need to be addressed, and that the \\nanswers will determine all of the issues on this application.  I have listed the questions in \\nthe order in which I intend to address them: \\n1. Does LCDC share an identity in patrimony with Langs? \\n2. Is LCDC “supported in part by public funds” as that phrase appears in subparagraph \\n3(1)12(iii) of the Act? \\n3. Is LCDC (or Langs, if they share an identity in patrimony) “organized for the relief of the \\npoor” as that phrase appears in subparagraph 3(1) 12 (iii) of the Act? \\nDECISION \\n[15] \\nFor the reasons that follow, I find that LCDC shares an identity in patrimony with Langs. \\n[16] \\nI find that LCDC is supported in part by public funds; and  \\n[17] \\nI find that LCDC and Langs are corporations organized for the relief of the poor. \\nANALYSIS \\n[18] \\nThe onus is on the Applicant, LCDC, to show that it falls within the exempting provision. \\nThe purpose of the Assessment Act is to raise revenues through the taxation of property to \\nenable municipal governments to meet their expenses. The Act recognizes that certain \\norganizations should be exempt from taxation in order to allow them to spend more of their \\nlimited resources on activities that are of a great benefit to either discrete groups of \\ndisadvantaged persons or to society as a whole: Ottawa Salus Corporation v. Municipal \\nProperty Assessment Corp., 69 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.). \\nISSUE 1: Does LCDC share an identity of patrimony with Langs? \\n[19] \\nI have found that Langs and LCDC share an identity in patrimony. Therefore, issue 2 is \\ndisposed of since it is agreed that Langs is largely supported by public funds.   \\n[20] \\nThe only issue left to address is whether Langs, or LCDC, are “organized for the relief of \\nthe poor”. However, I have examined each of the issues in relation to LCDC as the result \\nwould have been the same on the basis of LCDC’s primary argument, which is that they \\nmeet the exemption criteria independent of their relationship to Langs. \\n \\n \\nAn Identity in Patrimony \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n[21] \\nIn two 1994 decisions, the Supreme Court of Canada set out the principles to be considered \\nin determining whether a relationship in patrimony exists: Conseil de la Santé et des \\nServices Sociaux de la Région de Montréal Metropolitain and Buanderie Centrale de \\nMontréal Inc. v. City of Montréal and Communauté Urbaine de Montréal, [1994] 3 SCR \\n29 (“Counseil de la Santé (Montréal)”) and Partagec Inc. v. Communauté urbaine de \\nQuébec and City of Québec and Bureau de revision de l’évaluation foncière du Québec, \\n[1994] 3 S.C.R. 57 (“Partagec”).. \\n[22] \\nEach of these cases involved non profit corporations that were established by tax exempt \\nhospitals for the sole purpose of providing laundry services to hospitals. The hospitals had \\npreviously provided their own laundry services internally. The stated reason for the \\nincorporation of a separate entity to provide the laundry services was for cost savings and \\nfor tax purposes. \\n[23] \\nIn agreeing that the laundry corporations were entitled to exemption, the court identified \\n“an almost complete identity between the appellants and the establishments for whose \\nbenefit they operated”: Counseil de la Santé (Montréal), at p. 51. and the court stated, at p. \\n48, that: \\n \\na corporation may be regarded as the alter ego of another corporation when there is such a \\nclose relationship between them that what apparently concerns one actually pertains \\nto the activities of the other.  Undoubtedly a large number of factors can be \\nidentified to determine the existence of such a relationship:  in my opinion, \\nhowever, the one that is most explicit and most likely to cover all aspects of the \\nconcept is control. \\n[24] \\nThe court noted that even where there is absence of one corporation controlling the other, \\na court may still conclude that a relationship in patrimony exists when all of the evidence \\nis viewed, and when substance is prioritized over form in the interpretation of the \\nexempting statute. \\n[25] \\nIn the Ontario decision, St. George and St. Rueiss Copic Orthodox Church v. Municipal \\nProperty Assessment Corp., 2016 ONSC 1723, 130 O.R. (3d) 105(“St. George”), Dunphy \\nJ. also considered the application of s. 3(1)(12)iii of the Assessment Act. He found a \\nrelationship in patrimony between a tax-exempt church and the school that it incorporated \\nand controlled.   \\n[26] \\nIn considering the tax-exempt church’s decision to open a school, and to do so via a \\nseparate corporate entity, the court noted that “[i]t was thought advisable to incorporate a \\nsecond non-profit, non-share capital corporation to operate the school for insurance and \\nliability reasons”, and  that “there is no reason why the formerly tax exempt activities \\nshould be found to be altered by the change in legal structure since they form part of a \\ncommon patrimony”.  Dunphy J. found that the school was otherwise totally controlled by \\nthe church, and that they formed part of a common patrimony.   \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n[27] \\nThe Respondent relies on the Hospital for Sick Children v. MPAC, 2012 ONSC 1351, 97 \\nM.P.L.R. (4th) 130, where the court found that the hospital and the Applicant Foundation \\ndid not share an identity in patrimony. The application judge noted the Foundation and \\nhospital were separate corporate organizations, and the Foundation operated as an \\nindependent corporation. The Foundation’s goals were to raise funds for the support of the \\nhospital, and the evidence did not show that the Foundation was fully controlled by the \\nhospital. \\n[28] \\nIn that case, the court concluded the following at paragraph 30: \\nIn this case, I cannot conclude that the Foundation is a subordinate company with \\nno independent functioning of its own. Although HSC and the Foundation \\nundoubtedly have a close connection and interconnected governing structures, the \\nFoundation remains its own independent corporation, with its own Board of \\nDirectors and source of funding. \\n[29] \\nIn the present case, LCDC relies almost exclusively on the rents paid and donations made \\nby Langs to support itself. There is no evidence of LCDC doing any independent activity. \\nThe relationship between Langs and LCDC: \\n[30] \\nThe only objects in the letters patent of LCDC are a mandate to support the activities of \\nLangs. \\n[31] \\nThe Board of Directors of Langs caused LCDC to be incorporated, for the express purpose \\nof purchasing the land and constructing the building. Langs initially owned the building, \\nbut donated it to LCDC in 2018. LCDC currently owns the land and building, and it leases \\nthe entire building to Langs at below market rents. Langs then subleases portions of the \\nbuilding to community partners, also at below market rents. \\n[32] \\nThe record shows that LCDC is nearly completely financially dependant on Langs, and has \\nbeen so dependent since it was incorporated. In 2007, the year LCDC was incorporated, \\nthe financial statements show that LCDC’s revenues were 100% from Langs. LCDC \\nshowed zero revenue for two years after incorporation/the purchase of the property. In \\nthose two years, Langs loaned LCDC $10,000 each year to cover operating expenses.   \\n[33] \\nThe 2007 financial statements of Langs include the following description of LCDC under \\n“related party transactions”:  \\nLangs Farm Village Association (the Association) controls Langs Community \\nDevelopment Corporation (the Corporation). The Corporation is a not for profit \\ncorporation without share capital established for the purposes of acquiring land and \\nbuilding a multi-purpose facility that can be leased or sold by the Association. \\n[emphasis added.] \\n[34] \\nAs emphasized in the excerpt above, Langs asserts that it has the right to lease or sell the \\nland and building that are owned by LCDC. \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n[35] \\nThe financial dependency on Langs is ongoing. LCDC’s 2021 financial statements show \\napproximately $267,000 in rental income, all of which is from Langs. That rental income \\nis insufficient to cover LCDC’s operating expenses. The balance of revenue is donated by \\nLangs. \\n[36] \\nAs of March 31, 2021, LCDC owed over $641,000 to Langs. That amount was unsecured, \\nnon interest bearing, and had no specific terms of repayment. \\n[37] \\nI note that there is never any expense shown in any of the financial statements of LCDC \\nfor staff,  management, or personnel of any kind. LCDC has existed since 2007 and there \\nis no evidence as to the day-to-day operation or management of it. \\n[38] \\nI conclude from the financial relations between the two corporations, notwithstanding that \\nthey have separate Boards of Directors, the two corporations treat the funds and assets of \\none another as interchangeable. I find that LCDC is treated as the alter ego of Langs. \\nHow are Langs/LCDC treated by government/third parties? \\n[39] \\nIn granting $3,000,000 to Langs/LCDC for the construction of the community hub, the City \\nof Cambridge accepted one signature to represent both Langs and LCDC in a lengthy \\ncontract outlining the rights and obligations of the parties. Despite Langs being the only \\nsignatory to that contract, the City registered an encumbrance on the land owned by LCDC. \\nThe contract binds Langs to consequences if the property is sold by LCDC, and also \\nobligated LCDC to numerous terms. As discussed in detail below, the donation and lease \\nagreement with the City of Cambridge treats Langs and LCDC as one and the same entity. \\n[40] \\nLangs and LCDC also appear to be treated as one entity in a 2021 agreement between the \\nCity of Waterloo and Langs to lease space in the hub for a subsidized dental clinic. Langs \\nis described in that agreement as “the registered owner of the premises at 1145 Concession \\nRoad”. LCDC is the factual registered owner of the land, but the City of Waterloo’s \\nagreement is only with Langs. The agreement binds Langs to obligations that could only \\nbe undertaken by LCDC.  \\nBoard of Directors \\n[41] \\nThe Board of Langs caused LCDC to be incorporated in 2007, for organizational and \\nliability reasons. Evidence was provided via the detailed affidavit of Debra Hollahan, the \\nCEO of Langs, and a member of the Board of Directors of LCDC. Debra Hollahan states \\nthat as of the 2023 swearing of her affidavit, Langs / LCDC had two board members in \\ncommon, and that the majority of the LCDC board are either former Langs board members, \\nor former Langs clients. \\nConclusion Re Patrimony \\n[42] \\nI find that LCDC is a subordinate company with no independent functioning of its own, \\nand no separate activities or objects. I find that it was incorporated by Langs for a specific \\npurpose, and that it serves no independent purpose. I apply the reasoning of St. George to \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nthe case before me. The only reason LCDC exists is that Langs made the decision to shield \\nitself from risk. LCDC’s only purpose is to own the property and to support Langs. I find \\nthat LCDC is, in fact, as the financial statements of each corporation state, “controlled by \\nLangs”, and that there is a shared identity in patrimony. \\n[43] \\nHaving found that there is a shared identity in patrimony, it is not necessary to determine \\nwhether or not LCDC is itself supported in part by public funds. However, I have \\nconsidered the issue to demonstrate that the outcome would be the same even if the parties \\ndid not share an identity in patrimony. \\nISSUE 2: Is LCDC “supported in part by public funds” as that phrase appears in \\nsubparagraph 3(1)12(iii) of the Assessment Act? \\n[44] \\nIt is agreed that LCDC does not receive ongoing support from public funds and that Langs \\nreceives the majority of its revenues from public funds.  \\n[45] \\nLCDC argues that it received funds from the City of Cambridge on two occasions: once in \\n2007 when Langs received $200,000 for the purchase of the Property by LCDC, and again, \\nin 2012 when it was party to an agreement with the City of Cambridge to provide a \\n$3,000,000 grant for the building of the community hub. LCDC argues that either of the \\ntwo grants is sufficient to meet the requirement that it is supported in part by public funds. \\n[46] \\nThe Respondent argues that the $200,000 and all of the $3,000,000 grant from the City of \\nCambridge was actually paid to Langs, and that none of it was paid directly to LCDC. It is \\nagreed that the direct receipt of public funding is necessary to meet the requirements of s. \\n3(1)(12)iii of the Assessment Act.  \\n[47] \\nIn Stouffville Assessment Commissioner v. Mennonite Home Association, [1973] S.C.R. \\n189,, the majority of the court found that a grant in aid of the construction of the building \\nthat housed the organization was one of two ways in which the organization was “supported \\nin part by public funds”. The single act of funding was held to meet the requirement under \\nthe Assessment Act, that in order to be exempt, the organization must be supported in part \\nby public funds. \\nWas LCDC a direct recipient of either grant from the City of Cambridge? \\n[48] \\nThe City of Cambridge provided $200,000 toward the purchase of the land in 2007. The \\nmoney was received by Langs and not directly by LCDC. Langs transferred the money to \\nLCDC and it undertook to repay the money to the City if the building project did not \\nproceed as originally proposed. Although it is clear that the funds were used entirely for \\nthe benefit of LCDC, I find on the evidence before me (which did not include \\ndocumentation of any grant agreement) that this transaction  furthers the shared identity of \\nthe corporations. However, it does not meet the requirement that LCDC itself received \\npublic funds. \\n[49] \\nAn examination of the financing of the construction of the community hub leads me to \\nconclude that LCDC and Langs were treated as one entity not only internally, but in their \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\ndealings with the City of Cambridge. As such, I have found that the $3,000,000 grant from \\nthe City of Cambridge was in fact paid to LCDC, as well as to Langs, as the payments were \\nmade to the two organizations, and each corporation was bound to the terms of the \\nagreement. Whichever of the two corporations actually received the payments is not \\ndeterminative. The record does not include specifics of to whom and in what amounts each \\npayment was made, but it was inferred that the payments were, in fact, made to Langs. I \\nfind that confirmation of that information would not alter my conclusion. \\n[50] \\nOn July 19, 2012, the Corporation of the City of Cambridge entered into an agreement to \\nprovide $3,000,000 in funding toward the design and construction of the building at 1145 \\nConcession Road, in Cambridge, Ontario (the “Agreement”). \\n[51] \\nThe Agreement is peculiar in that there are three named parties to the Agreement on the \\nface page, but only two signatories. The named parties to the Agreement are 1) the \\nCorporation of the City of Cambridge; 2) Langs; and 3) LCDC.   \\n[52] \\nBoth Langs and LCDC are referred to throughout the agreement, together, as “Langs”, \\nalthough the full name Langs Farm Village Association appears sporadically in the \\ndocument as well.   \\n[53] \\nOn the signature page of the Agreement, the Chairman and Executive Director of Langs \\nFarm Village Association are the only signatures that appear for both of the Langs parties, \\nwhich are described under the signatures as “Langs Farm Village Association”. To be clear, \\nthere is no space for any signatory on behalf of LCDC, and there is no signature on its \\nbehalf, on the Agreement.  \\n[54] \\nNotwithstanding that LCDC is not a signatory to the Agreement, I find that the related \\nLangs parties were treated as a single entity and that each corporation agreed to be bound \\nby it. This can be seen in many instances throughout the agreement.  I provide some \\nexamples here: \\na) Both Langs Farm Village Association and LCDC are described in the title of the \\nAgreement together as “Langs” \\nb) The introductory paragraphs describe Langs as the owner of the land and buildings \\nat 1145 Concession Road. This reference is necessarily to LCDC. \\nc) Throughout the agreement, the name “Langs” is used variously to describe \\nobligations of Langs Farm Village Association, or Langs Community Development \\nCorporation, without distinguishing them in any way. There are numerous \\nexamples in the document where the reference is to “Langs” but the accompanying \\nobligation can only be in reference to the corporation holding title to the property, \\nwhich is LCDC.   \\nd) In sections 8 and 9 of the Agreement, Langs agrees to continuously own the \\nbuilding and does not transfer it without the written consent of the City. The penalty \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nfor transfer without permission is that the City may ask for repayment of all of part \\nof the $3,000,000.  \\ne) The City of Cambridge registered a notice on title to the land and building owned \\nby LCDC to secure its interests in the Agreement. \\nf) Schedule F to the agreement refers to how funds are to be paid. Schedule F refers \\nboth specifically to Langs Farm Village Association in the first paragraph, and to \\nLangs in the second, rendering the distinction meaningless.   \\n[55] \\nI find that the City of Cambridge treated the related Lang corporations as one entity and \\nthat the funds were advanced to the benefit of LCDC, as well as to Langs. I find that both \\ncorporations were intended to be bound by the terms, including the risk of repayment of \\nthe funds in the event of a breach of the terms. Indeed, the lien placed on the land owned \\nby LCDC was the only security for this risk. \\n[56] \\nIn these unusual circumstances, I find that this document is evidence that LCDC, together \\nwith Langs, received $3,000,000 from the City of Cambridge in support of the construction \\nof the community hub/community centre, and LCDC is the current owner of the building, \\nwhich was constructed in part with those funds. LCDC has met its onus to show that it was \\nsupported in part by public funds. \\nISSUE 1: Is the Applicant a “corporation organized for the relief of the poor” as that phrase \\nappears in subparagraph 3(1) 12 (iii) of the Assessment Act?; \\nThe Law \\n[57] \\nIf the two corporations share an identity in patrimony, as I have found, one of them must \\nbe organized for the relief of the poor. In order to qualify for exemption on its own, LCDC \\nmust show that it is organized for the relief of the poor on its own. The position of the \\nRespondent is that neither corporation meets this requirement, and as such, neither is \\neligible for tax exempt status. \\n[58] \\nThe Respondent argues that the community hub serves the entire population of residents in \\nthe geographical vicinity and that the Applicant has not shown that it is organized for the \\nrelief of the poor, even in the event of a shared identity in patrimony.   \\n[59] \\nIn addressing this issue, the parties made representation regarding the meaning of the word \\n“poor”. In London (City) v. Bryon Optimist Sports Complex Inc., 23 M.P.L.R. 10 (C.A.), \\nthe court held that the persons need not be destitute, but that there must be an element of \\neconomic deprivation or need, the relief from which is a “part of the purpose” of the \\ninstitution claiming the exemption. \\n[60] \\nIn determining whether a charity was “organized for the relief of the poor”, the Court  of \\nAppeal in Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph Housing Corp. v. Regional Assessment \\nCommissioner (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 532 (C.A.) stated that it was necessary to consider the \\ncorporate objects. The court went on to interpret the wording in the Assessment Act as \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nfollows: “I read the words ‘organized for the relief of the poor\\' to mean that it would be the \\ncorporation itself, by some form of endeavor of the corporation, which would provide the \\nrelief involved.” [Emphasis in original.]  \\n[61] \\nIn Religious Hospitallers, the court found that the housing corporation who rented to poor \\ntenants was not itself organized for the relief of the poor as it did not relieve the poverty of \\nits tenants through any endeavour , since the rents were either paid directly by the tenants, \\nor subsidized by government, and the corporation itself did nothing to relieve the tenants’ \\npoverty. \\n[62] \\nIn the recent Divisional Court decision in Stamford Kiwanis Non-Profit Homes Inc. v. \\nMunicipal Property Assessment Corporation and the Corporation of the City of Niagara \\nFalls (affirming the decision of Bordin J. of the Superior Court of Justice, dated November \\n29, 2022, with reasons reported at 2022 ONSC 6392), the court found that a corporation \\nwas not organized for the relief of the poor when it did not engage in activity other than \\nprovide housing which was paid for by tenants or via government subsidies.  \\n[63] \\nI find that, on the facts before me, the primary purpose of LCDC is to uphold the purposes \\nof Langs. The facility is leased by LCDC to Langs at below market rates, and in fact, at \\nrates which do not cover operating costs. The agreement between the two corporations is \\nintended to take only the minimally required resources from Langs to cover the actual \\nexpenses of operating the facility. LCDC itself is involved in Lang’s efforts, when LCDC \\nenables Langs to relieve poverty. As described below, the evidence shows that Langs is \\ninvolved both directly via its own programs, and indirectly via the works of its community \\npartners, in many direct endeavours to relieve poverty, all of which lead to the conclusion \\nthat it is organized for the relief of the poor.  \\nThe Objects of the Corporations: \\n[64] \\nAs of 2017 the objects of LCDC are: \\n1. To promote the effectiveness of Langs Farm Village Association’s charitable \\nprograms by providing and maintaining facilities for this purpose; and \\n2. To undertake activities ancillary and incidental to the attainment of the above \\ncharitable purposes. [Emphasis added.] \\n[65] \\nThe current objects of Langs Farm Village Association are:  \\n Objects:……..to provide a community centre and outreach/satellite services to benefit the \\nvulnerable and low income populations of Langs Farm Village area, Preston community, \\nthe City of Cambridge and the Township of North Dumfries…. [Emphasis added.] \\n[66] \\nThe following are excerpts of the portions of the affidavit of Debra Hollahan which address \\nthe issue of whether LCDC/Langs are organized for the relief of poverty: \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 “poverty is a social determinant of health. On widely accepted measures, the Langs \\nclients have health care needs that are 52% more complex than the average Ontario \\npatient”. \\n\\uf0b7 “The neighbourhood is a densely populated, low income, community with higher \\nfamily and child poverty rates.  In addition, education levels are below the city \\naverage with a higher proportion of families and individuals living in subsidized \\nhousing.”  \\n\\uf0b7 “The majority of the people seen at Langs have multiple health and social service \\nneeds related to both psychosocial and physical issues.  The most prevalent health \\nissues within the medical practice are: cardiac disease, diabetes, mental illness, \\nprimary health, and addictions often exacerbated by poverty.  A significant number \\nof individuals accessing care have either acute or chronic mental health issues \\ncomplicating their ability to follow through and manage their own care.” \\n[67] \\nDuring examination on her affidavit, Debra Hollahan, stated: “I estimate that at least two-\\nthirds of clients that benefit from Langs’ services have incomes below $40,000. The income \\nfor these clients is generally from government programs, with the vast majority being from \\nthe Ontario Disability Support Program. This estimate is based on my personal interactions \\nwith clients and from my conversations with the case managers and previous CEO at \\nLangs.” \\n[68] \\nIn addition, Debra Hollahan describes Langs as a community hub, and provides a number \\nof government publications which confirm that community hubs are central access points \\nfor a range of health and social services. The materials include a 1997 report of the \\nAssociation of Ontario Health Centres, which states that “Community Health Centres have \\na long history and a proud tradition of working effectively with all sectors of society and \\nparticularly with people who are physically, socially and economically disadvantaged that \\nis people who carry the greatest burden of illness in our society and experience the greatest \\nbarriers to accessing care”. The report states that the clients of Community Health Centres \\ninclude low income and isolated older people, low income parents, street youth, and \\nhomeless people, among others. Read in its entirely, the report provides strong evidence in \\nsupport of a position that a Community Health Centre’s mandate is the relief of poverty. \\n[69] \\nDebra Hollahan’s affidavit includes a partner by partner description of Lang’s community \\npartners, emphasizing the fact that most of them target low income area residents. This, \\nthereby lends support to the position that even the 4900 square feet which are rented to \\nthose community partners is space used in furtherance of the objects of Langs. \\n[70] \\nLangs collected statistical information in relation to patients of the Health Centre which \\nforms part of the Community Hub. Debra Hollahan explained that nearly 40% of the clients \\ndid not respond. Of the Health Centre clients that did respond, the survey showed that 58% \\nare below the accepted Market Basket Measure of poverty, and 44% have incomes below \\n$25,000 pe year. Debra Hollahan opined that the lower income users were less likely to \\nrespond to a survey than those with higher income. At the time the materials were collected, \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nthere were 3638 active clients at the Health Centre and 11,762 clients attending all \\nprograms at the community hub.  \\n[71] \\nThe Ontario Seniors Dental Care Program is operated by Langs in the hub. Patients who \\nare single must have an income below $22,200, and couples must have an income below \\n$37,100 to access the program. As of the time the information was gathered for this \\nApplication, that program had a waitlist. \\n[72] \\nThe Respondent argues that Debra Hollahan’s evidence is largely anecdotal as data was \\nnot collected or maintained in respect of many of the programs, and there is no data from \\nthe majority of the community hub users. \\n[73] \\nIn Family Service Assn. of Metropolitan Toronto v. Ontario (Regional Assessment \\nCommissioner, Region No. 9), 23 O.R. (3d) 382 (S.C.), Justice Wilson stated that \\n“[a]lthough the applicant bears the onus of proving the exemption in taxation cases, we \\nmust be mindful of not imposing a disproportionate burden to maintain meticulous and \\ncostly statistics. Such a burden could defeat the purpose of conferring a benefit upon the \\nqualifying charitable organizations.” \\n[74] \\nThe Respondent urges me to find that the Applicant is a community center which provides \\nhealth, recreational, and informational services to the entire community within its \\ncatchment area, and in some instances, the broader Cambridge region –  not just the poor. \\nAs such, the Respondent argues the Applicant does not qualify for the exemption. In \\nsupport of this argument, the Respondent refers me to census data which shows that a \\nmajority of residents of the catchment area are not poor.  \\n[75] \\nI find that the Census data in the materials is not helpful on this issue. The fact that the \\nmajority of the Cambridge Area community is not below the poverty line is not the issue \\nto be determined. The Census data also shows that a significant percentage of area residents \\nhave trouble paying bills and have an income that is below the poverty line. The question \\nis not “are the residents of the catchment area mostly poor?”, but rather “is LCDC/Langs \\norganized for the relief of those residents who are poor?”  \\n[76] \\nIn my view, the answer to this question lies in identifying which residents of the catchment \\narea the hub actually serves. If it serves the poor, is the applicant organized to provide their \\nrelief? \\n[77] \\nCertainly, if Langs operates pursuant to its objects, it is organized to “….benefit the \\nvulnerable and low income populations…..”, and would therefore, reasonably be said to be \\n“organized for relief of poverty”.  \\n[78] \\nAs such, LCDC, whose sole object it is to promote the effectiveness of Langs, would \\ntherefore, reasonably be said to be “organized for relief of poverty”, if its activities are in \\nkeeping with that object. \\nDoes the evidence of the actual endeavours of Langs & LCDC support the conclusion that \\nthey operate pursuant to their objects? \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\n[79] \\nI find the activities of Langs clearly support the conclusion that it operates pursuant to its \\nobjects. As a charity, Langs offers its own programs. Many of these programs appear to be \\naimed at those in economic need, including: \\n \\na) dental services for low income clients;  \\n \\nb) counselling for low income clients;  \\n \\nc) alternative education programming for people at risk of dropping out of school;  \\n \\nd) food vouchers and a food pantry;  \\n \\ne) community showers for people who do not have stable housing; \\n \\nf) computer access;   \\n \\ng) health supports to the homeless;  \\n \\nh) foot care; \\n \\ni) physiotherapy for those without third party insurance;  \\n \\nj) Christmas gifts for low-income clients, and subsidized after school programs;   \\nk) an alternative education program for grades seven and eight students, who are \\nidentified as at risk of failing and dropping out of school, and need need education \\nand mental health supports in a smaller community-based classroom;  \\nl) a compassionate fund to assist with prescription medication and refer patients to \\nthe Trillium Drug Program; and \\nm) designated computer access and staff to support individuals with housing \\napplications and evictions as well as employment counselling and resume writing. \\n[80] \\nLangs began to administer the Ontario Seniors Dental Care Program (the “Dental Care \\nProgram”), a publicly funded dental care program for low-income seniors, in 2020. One of \\nthe criteria for eligibility in the Dental Care Program is that clients are a single senior aged \\n65 or older with an annual net income of $22,200 or less, or senior couples (one or both \\npeople aged 65 or older), with a combined annual net income of $37,100 or less.  \\n[81] \\nThe afterschool program supports working parents living on a lower income, at a cost of \\n$10 per week. This program is funded by the Ministry of Heritage, Tourism, Culture and \\nSport specifically for low-income families. Comparable programs in the city range from \\n$60-$100 per week. \\n[82] \\nLangs Community Health Centre is a member of the Association of Ontario Health Centres \\n(“CHCs\"). In a 1997 publication, the Association discusses community health centres and \\nstated:  \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\nCHCs traditionally have provided services to groups of people who do not easily \\nand regularly access primary care. Typically people in these groups do not have a \\nfamily physician and may receive care only when they present at hospital \\nemergency rooms. The cost of this care is far greater than the cost of regular primary \\ncare. People with low incomes and older people are two of the priority groups \\nserved by CHCs.  \\n[83] \\nThe statistical data from the health centre indicates that about 58% of the users of the health \\ncentre within the hub are people living below the poverty line.  \\nCommunity Partners occupying 4,900 square feet of the facility: \\n[84] \\nOf the 17 partner programs operating in the community hub, many of them are specifically \\ntargeted to lower income residents. The community partners include inter alia: Alzheimer \\nSociety, Canadian Mental Health Association, Community Support Connections – Meals \\non Wheels, Family and Children Services of Waterloo Region, and The M.S. Society. \\n[85] \\nAll of the community partners except Langs Medical Pharmacy and Dr. Emary, a \\nchiropractor, are charitable or not-for-profit. Debra Hollahan’s brief review of the services \\nprovided by the partners is further evidence that the majority operate to assist people living \\nin poverty. \\n[86] \\nFurther, Langs provides the following benefits to its tenants/community partners: \\n \\na) rent at below market rates; \\nb) an all-inclusive rent which includes utilities, all operational costs such as phone, \\ninternet and access to shared spaces. Tenants can use meeting rooms once per \\nmonth with no additional cost and the units are furnished with desks and chairs; \\n \\nc) flexible meeting room spaces for workshops and events; \\n \\nd) a community kitchen; \\ne) community development with a focus on opportunities for collaboration and \\nideas for cost savings; \\n \\nf) full sized gymnasium and walking track; and \\n \\ng) shared reception services on two floors. \\n[87] \\nProvision of these supportive services ensures that these organizations will remain as \\ntenants and continue to offer their services.   \\n[88] \\nI find that the Census and other data supports the proposition that there is a need in the \\ncommunity for services aimed at lower income residents, or put another way, services \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nintended to address the relief of poverty – and that the community hub addresses those \\nneeds. \\n[89] \\nI find that the evidence of Debra Hollahan, combined with the data from the health centre \\nand the information about programs offered in the hub, supports the proposition that, on a \\nbalance of probabilities, a substantial percentage of the clients of Langs are people who are \\nfairly described as poor. I accept that the majority of the programming provided by Langs \\nare either directly aimed at assisting the poor or are utilized by lower income clients who \\nattend the hub for other services.  \\n[90] \\nI find that LCDC and Langs are organized for the relief of the poor. \\nIs the entire building occupied for similar activities or is a partial exemption in order? \\n[91] \\nAlthough it was agreed at the outset that LCDC owns, uses and occupied the property, \\nduring submissions, the Respondent argued that, in fact, Langs itself only occupies a little \\nover half of the space in the building.  \\n[92] \\nOf approximately 67,000 square feet of space, the occupancy is as follows: \\n \\na) 35,148 sq. ft. to Langs for its various programs. \\nb) 9,130 sq. ft. to the City of Cambridge for a recreation centre. I note that this \\nportion is exempt from property tax as a municipal facility pursuant to s.110 of the \\nMunicipal Act. Therefore, this portion is not in issue. \\nc)17,489 sq. ft. is shared between Langs, the City of Cambridge and other \\noccupants, and consists of “entrances, electrical and furnace spaces, main foyer and \\nwashrooms, gymnasium and hallways”. I find that this shared space is also \\noccupied by Langs. \\nd) Approximately 4,900 sq. ft. are subleased by Langs to various community \\npartners already discussed.   \\n[93] \\nIn Anglican Church of Canada, Diocese of Toronto Camps v. Municipal Property \\nAssessment Corp., Region No. 16, 246 D.L.R. (4th) 170, at para. 11,  in discussing s. 3(1)11 \\nof the Assessment Act, the court held that “the test for determining whether an exemption \\nshould be granted is whether the primary purpose of the institution comes within the words \\ndefining the exemption in the Assessment Act.” [emphasis added]. \\n[94] \\nThe court went on to elaborate on the use of the term “primary purpose” at para. 12, noting \\nthat it is “well established in the jurisprudence of this province. It requires an objective \\ndetermination of the principal purpose for which the land is used and occupied. That \\npurpose must be distinguished from others that are incidental to it”.  \\n[95] \\nI rely on the decisions in Anglican Church of Canada,  Ottawa Salus Corporation v. \\nMunicipal Property Assessment Corp., , and the companion decision, Causeway \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\nFoundation v. Ontario Property Asessment Corp., Region No. 3, 235 D.L.R. (4th) 754 \\n(C.A.) to find that LCDC occupied the property, including the smaller portions leased to \\nits community partners, in furtherance of its charitable purpose, which is to support the \\ncharitable works of Langs. \\n[96] \\nIn Ottawa Salus,  the property itself was occupied by tenants of Salus, and not Salus itself. \\nJustice Macpherson noted at para. 36: \\n“Occupation for purposes of the exemption does not require actual or exclusive \\noccupation by the charitable institution.”  \\n[97] \\nOf the portion of the building which is not occupied by the City of Cambridge, I find that \\nLangs occupies that vast majority of the space, either exclusively or as common space with \\nother tenants including the tax exempt City of Cambridge. I find that the relatively small \\nportion of the building that is subleased to community partners, includes a majority of \\npartners whose services are aimed at the relief of the poor. The community partners are, as \\nsuch, a part of the greater community hub and doing work in furtherance of the objects of \\nLangs and LCDC. The community partner leases are at low rates which are partially \\nsubsidized and include many features which would not accompany most commercial \\nleases.  \\n CONCLUSIONS \\n[98] \\nI find that LCDC shares an identity in patrimony with Langs. \\n[99] \\nI find that the Applicant, LCDC, meets the criteria for property tax exemption under the \\nAssessment Act, since the 2018 taxation year, both independently because it meets all of \\nthe statutory requirements for exemption, and because it shares an identity in patrimony \\nwith Langs.  \\nCOSTS \\n[100] The parties have advised me that they have already made an agreement as to costs. As such, \\nI make no order. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nJustice S. Antoniani \\n \\nReleased: March 28, 2024 \\n2024 ONSC 1864 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\nCITATION: Langs Community v.

The \\nappellant testified and called the Establishment’s former manager, M.S. as a witness. \\n[6] \\nBoth M.S. and S.K. were working on May 15, 2019.  \\n[7] \\nAt the hearing of the appeal, the appellant submits the following grounds:  \\n1. \\nThe trial judge erroneously discounted a significant inconsistency in the \\ncomplainant’s evidence based on inapplicable principles involving \\ndelayed disclosure and sexual stereotypes.  \\n2. \\nThe trial judge failed to deal with the inherent implausibility of the \\ncomplainant’s version of events in assessing her credibility.  \\n3. \\nThe trial judge materially misapprehended the evidence. \\n4. \\nThere is fresh evidence that shows the appellant was truthful on a material \\npoint in his evidence for which the trial judge made a negative credibility \\nfinding.  \\n[8] \\nThe appellant relies on:   \\n1. \\nThe transcript of the proceedings of January 11, 2022;  \\n2. \\nThe transcript of the proceedings of January 12, 2022;  \\n3. \\nThe transcript of the proceedings of February 22, 2022;  \\n4. \\nThe written reasons for judgment, released on February 22, 2022; and  \\n5. \\nFresh evidence if the court admits same.  \\n[9] \\nThe appellant confirmed at the hearing of this appeal that he was no longer advancing the \\nground of misapprehension of the camera evidence. \\n[10] \\nThe appellant seeks an order allowing the appeal, quashing the conviction, and ordering a \\nnew trial.  \\n[11] \\nThe respondent Crown asks that the appeal be dismissed. \\n[12] \\nThe Crown filed an appeal against sentence. However, on agreement, on the basis that the \\nresult of the appeal will dictate whether or not the cross-appeal is proceeded with, the \\ncross-appeal was not dealt with. \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n[13] \\nI have reviewed all the evidence filed and considered all submissions and authorities \\nrelied on although I may not refer to all individually. \\nDISCUSSION/CONSIDERATIONS/ANALYSIS \\nISSUES  \\n[14] \\nThe following are the issues raised by this appeal: \\n1. Leave to introduce fresh evidence; \\n2. Error to discount an inconsistency; \\n3. Three submitted misapprehensions of evidence;  \\ni. D.K.S.’s evidence regarding the vehicle he was operating on May 15, \\n2019; \\nii. D.K.S.’s evidence/use of the word “sitting” to describe the location of the \\ncomplainant at the time he was obtaining the promotional materials he was \\nobtaining from his vehicle; and  \\niii. Good character evidence led. \\nEVIDENCE \\nEvidence of the Complainant \\n[15] \\nThe complainant worked as a bartender/server for the appellant at the Establishment. She \\nhad also previously worked for him at an A&W restaurant that he owned, when she was \\nyounger. She started working at the Establishment in January of 2019, about five months \\nbefore the alleged occurrence. \\n[16] \\nThe complainant testified that on May 15, 2019, she worked an afternoon shift. She asked \\nto leave early — at 10:00 p.m. — because she wanted to go out with her friend, J., for J’s \\nbirthday.  \\n[17] \\nThe complainant drew a floor plan of the Establishment and labelled certain areas, \\nincluding location of doors, the bar, a pool table, two dining rooms, washrooms, the \\nkitchen, and prep area. \\n[18] \\nThe complainant testified that she and S.K. were good co-workers with a good \\nrelationship – that she worked on her shift. They had worked over “100 shifts” together \\nbut were not friends outside of work. In cross-examination she admitted the “100 shifts” \\ncomment was not accurate; they had only worked a few shifts together. However, their \\nshifts overlapped quite a bit and so it felt like hundreds of times they worked together. \\nThey interacted with each other either behind the bar when making drinks or when \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nwaiting for food to come out. They had good conversations. The appellant raised this as \\none example of issues of credibility at trial he asked for the trial judge to consider in the \\nassessment of her evidence. An important piece for the appellant was the overall \\nassessment of credibility and reliability of the evidence of C.G. and not necessarily an \\nindividualized assessment of each issue noted. \\n[19] \\nC.G. identified the appellant as her “boss”, that she first met at age 13, when she worked \\nher first job at A&W. He had taken over ownership of the A&W from her initial \\nemployer. She believed she had been employed there for approximately a year before the \\nappellant and his wife took over the A&W. She was a dishwasher at that time. She was \\nnot certain of the year they took over. She worked there until she was 17. She eventually \\nleft that job at A&W to work at another restaurant. Other than when the appellant was at \\nthe A&W and ultimately at the Establishment after she got a job there, she saw the \\nappellant in passing at the grocery store. She also took his daughter skating when she was \\nyounger at the arena, but these interactions were mainly with his wife and child. These \\ninteractions occurred when she was working at A&W. \\n[20] \\nOn May 15, 2019, the complainant testified that her co-worker, S.K.; the restaurant’s \\nmanager, M.S.; and cook, G., were working. The complainant’s friend J. and her \\nboyfriend, M., had come and were at the Establishment before her shift ended. She \\nstarted her shift that day around 3:30 or 4:00 p.m. She believes she was scheduled to \\nmidnight. \\n[21] \\nThe complainant testified that on this evening, the Establishment was not busy. It was her \\nfriend J.’s birthday and there were maybe 10 people in the restaurant, which is why she \\nasked to leave early, to spend some time with her friend and boyfriend. She was not sure \\nwho she asked.  \\n[22] \\nC.G. remembered that the appellant was at the bar in the Establishment, having dinner. \\nAccording to the complainant, the appellant only came to the Establishment a couple of \\ntimes a month, or every couple of weeks, leaving the day-to-day operation to the \\nmanager, M.S.  \\n[23] \\nAfter C.G. asked to leave early that evening, but before the end of her shift, the \\ncomplainant testified that the appellant asked her if she could go in the back and grab \\nsome boxes. In addition to being a server, she was also the promoter for the \\nEstablishment. She explained that the appellant and his wife would give her things to \\ngive out to people that she worked with or people within the community. The \\ncomplainant testified that at the time she was also helping the appellant with the \\nEstablishment’s website and promotions. By May 15, 2019, she had that role for about a \\nmonth or two. At the time, he asked her to do this, she was by the bar, on the serving side \\nbehind it, and he was on the other side of the bar, dining side of it.  He asked if she could \\ndo this before she left. She testified they went right away after he asked her. Based on her \\nevidence, this would be at around 10:30pm to 11:00pm. \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n[24] \\nAt around 10:30pm to 11:00pm, the complainant states that she followed the appellant \\ninto the back of the Establishment through the kitchen, then out of the whole building, to \\nhis vehicle. They exited through the back door after going through the prep area straight \\nthrough the back doors to his Cadillac Escalade, which was parked outside, near a \\ndumpster. C.G. added the dumpster which she named ‘dumpster” and the vehicle she \\nnamed “car”, meaning the appellants’ vehicle on to the floor plan drawing filed. \\n[25] \\nC.G. stated that nobody was outside when they went outside but as they passed through \\nthe kitchen, S.K. or maybe one of the cooks could have possibly seen her walk past with \\nthe appellant. She was not sure if they were paying attention. \\n[26] \\nC.G. stated the boxes were in the backseat of the appellant’s vehicle, the boxes being 2 \\nfeet long and 3 feet high which she corrected to a foot and a half high - cardboard. She \\nwent on to state that they were fairly heavy but indicated that they “weren’t too bad”. The \\ntwo boxes were initially described by her as one on top of each other. C.G. stated that the \\nappellant picked up the boxes and handed them to her and put them in her arms. She had \\nboth her hands underneath the box with them resting within her forearms against her \\nbody which she described as “cradling them” because she did not want to drop them – \\npalms face up, forearms extended 90 degrees cupping the boxes. When she was being \\nhanded the boxes, the appellant was facing her and her right shoulder was facing the \\nbuilding and her left shoulder, the bush line. During cross-examination, C.G. when it was \\nput to her that it was only one box, not two, testified that it was a box inside of a box \\nbecause there were breakable items so there was a box inside of a box. She also testified \\nthat the one box that was on top of the other was not sitting well inside of the underneath \\nbox. \\n[27] \\nC.G. stated that as the appellant gave her the boxes, when he took his hands away, he had \\nbrushed down her front with his hand and that hand contacted her vagina over her \\nclothing (the “swiping”). The swiping was demonstrated as the knuckle side of his hand \\ntouching the upper chest area and rubbing down her torso. She places his hands as he was \\ngiving her the boxes as underneath the boxes – like holding it to give it to her and this is \\nwhy she thought maybe the swiping was an accident. But then she states, he grabbed her \\nbuttocks twice and that is when she connected “two and two together”. C.G. stated the \\nswiping took probably 30 seconds and stated that while he was swiping, she was walking \\naway. She then explained that when he contacted her vagina that is when she had started \\nto walk away and as she started to walk away, he grabbed her buttocks twice. Her \\nthoughts that he “was grabbing” her occurred at this moment of time. She stated that she \\ncontinued to walk away, kept the boxes in her arms and left. She testified that the swiping \\nwas a 30-second swipe, followed by “it was, I don’t know”, followed by “like 20 \\nseconds, 30 seconds”, followed by “It was quick. It was brief.”. The Crown asked her to \\nprovide the length of time starting from the time she feels the swiping to her turning \\naround to walk away. She would explain then, it was almost instantly, and that she turned \\naround right away once she felt the contact. When she felt her buttocks being grabbed, \\nshe was now facing the building. The left side of her buttocks was grabbed first followed \\nby the right side, almost immediately after. The left grab she stated lasted three to four \\nseconds and the right side, the same amount of time. She testified that at this point, she \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nkind of looked back at him because she wanted to say something, but she did not. She \\ndoes not remember if he said anything. She did not want to make a scene. She just \\nwanted to get out of there. \\n[28] \\nAfter getting the boxes, she testified that as she was walking through the bar in the \\nEstablishment after the incident, she looked at her friend J. and asked her to go outside \\nwith her, to open her vehicle door for her. She described that J. went outside with her and \\nonce outside, she told J. about the incident. There was a plan that night to call a driver to \\ncome and take the complainant’s vehicle and drive them home because they wanted to \\nhave a couple of drinks, but after the incident that did not happen. They ended up just \\nleaving. She asked J. not to say anything to her boyfriend because she did not want him \\nto create any animosity and/or get angry.  \\n[29] \\nAfter a morning break, C.G. continued to testify and stated that J. was in the left side area \\ndining room in the Establishment when she asked her to help her.  She then stated that \\nshe was pretty sure it was her vehicle she had that evening because she always drives \\nherself to work - but that she could not really remember. She went to whatever vehicle it \\nwas because she wanted to bring the boxes to her vehicle so that she could bring it to her \\nother job. The boxes get placed in that vehicle. C.G. states they were placed in the \\nbackseat of her car. After, she and J. go back into the Establishment because the whole \\nplan was to celebrate J.’s birthday. However, that all just came to an end. She asked if \\nthey could go home and back to her boyfriend’s apartment. That is what happened after \\nshe waited for them to finish their beverages. She placed her boyfriend at the back table \\nin the far-left corner of the Establishment. On cross-examination, C.G. stated that when \\nshe came inside with the box/boxes she stopped to talk to J. to ask her to come outside \\nwith her. She relayed her complaint to J. right then and there. She explained this was \\nbecause she was distraught and did not know if that is what really happened or not and \\nshe needed to process it and say it out loud. \\n[30] \\nC.G. tested that if she would have had a drink that evening, it would have been after her \\nshift and after the incident because within the time frame that she was done her clean-up \\nit happened right away, and she did not have time to sit down because her shift ended at \\n10:00 p.m.  \\n[31] \\nAfter the incident, after she had re-entered the Establishment, C.G. stated she did not see \\nthe appellant again, stating that he had left right away. She explained that after she came \\nback into the Establishment after placing boxes in her vehicle, he was already gone. She \\nwas not sure if he left through the front door or the back door. \\n[32] \\nWhen she and J. returned to the Establishment, she stayed with J. and her boyfriend for a \\nshort time before they left. She testified that she did not consume any alcohol or drugs. \\nThe complainant testified that the appellant left the Establishment right after he gave her \\nthe boxes; she never saw him in the Establishment after she returned from storing the \\nboxes in her car. The complainant reported the incident to the police about a week later, \\nafter messaging the appellant’s wife - S.S. - and telling S.S. that she would not be in for \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nher next couple of shifts. She did not actually speak to S.S. until after she had gone to the \\npolice. \\n[33] \\nOn cross-examination C.G. denied that she took a drink from her boyfriend’s drink after \\nshe came back in. When it was put to her that if S.K. said she did it would be wrong and  \\nher response was that she did not remember having anything to drink. She did not \\nremember staying for half an hour to an hour at the establishment with her friends \\ndrinking after the incident. She just remembered waiting for them to finish their drinks \\nand food and driving them home.  \\n[34] \\nAfter the incident, C.G. denied going to the bar and speaking to M.S. stating she will try \\nto follow the rules and make them happy or something along those lines. She also denied \\nbeing upset with the appellant that night related to him speaking to her about her work \\nperformance. \\n[35] \\nWhen asked by the court how long she was in the Establishment after the incident she \\nresponded that she honestly did not remember but that it was less than an hour. \\n[36] \\nThe complainant acknowledged that she did not get along with people at her work, \\nincluding one of the cooks, L., and the manager, M.S. She was aware they both had made \\ncomplaints about her work - the cook L. made complaints all the time. In cross, C.G. \\nstated she did not remember if cook G. was there but that M.S. certainly was. \\n[37] \\nC.G. again denied that the appellant had talked to her about her work performance on \\nMay 15. She did not agree that the appellant was in the Establishment more than every \\ncouple of weeks or once a month. She did agree that when the appellant did come, he \\nwould deal with staffing issues and things like that, and deal with M.S. a lot. She stated \\nthe appellant was mainly in the office. When it was suggested to her there was a staff \\nmeeting the evening on May 15, C.G. stated she did not remember. She did not remember \\nhim meeting with cook L. or S.K. or M.S. - stating she “was busy serving people”. She \\nwas not really hanging around or paying attention to what these others were doing; she \\nwas paying attention to her customers. C.G. also testified that she did not remember if the \\nappellant met with her about some job complaints, he had with her, that day. It was \\nsuggested to her that in fact in the kitchen area, he met with her about some complaints \\nhe had from staff members that she was sometimes late for work. Her response was “Yes. \\nBecause I had two jobs. I worked two jobs.”. She had a job at a school 35 minutes away. \\nShe denied that he asked her about shortages in drinks and money or checking IDs or not \\ncleaning up after herself in the kitchen area. She complained to the appellant about others \\nnot checking IDs and added that it was never dealt with. She testified that cook L. had \\nnever liked her and they did not get along. She was not surprised if cook L. had \\ncomplained. She acknowledged that she heard complaints about her drinking at the bar \\nand she was not sure if it was a complaint made by M.S. or another. She testified that the \\nappellant had talked to her previously about it. She also remembers having sent a text to \\nhim saying she had filled shot glasses with water and juice to pretend she was taking \\nshots with customers. She sent the text to let him know in case it was thought she was \\nactually drinking at work and was not. She agreed the text was sent May 4th, responding \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nto complaints about her drinking at the bar. She denied any conversations about fixing \\nwork performance issues on May 15. She agreed in her evidence she was suggesting that \\nit was earlier, not that day. She sent the text to the appellant on May 4th because she felt \\nthat M.S. had it out for her. M.S. and cook L. were in cahoots against her. She felt \\neveryone was complaining about her work performance. She indicated she sent the text to \\nthe appellant because M.S. confronted her about drinking and she knew he would be \\ncalling the appellant right away complaining about her like he always did so she just \\nwanted to start defending herself. She agreed it would make sense that the appellant \\nwould receive complaints about employees and have to address them. C.G. repeatedly \\nanswered that no complaints were addressed with her on May 15.  \\n[38] \\nC.G. later acknowledged the appellant did express concerns about her being late for \\nwork. She denied that he spoke to her about shortages in cash and/or alcohol taken from \\nthe bar or her not checking identifications. She acknowledged that the appellant had \\nspoken to her about drinking at the bar while working but stated that was on a previous \\noccasion—not May 15, 2019. The complainant did not move from her evidence that the \\nappellant did not speak to her about her work performance on May 15, 2019. The \\ncomplaints about her drinking at the bar went back to May 4, 2019.  \\n[39] \\nOn re-examination, C.G. was asked if she ever had a conversation with the appellant \\nabout her work performance. She responded that she did not have a conversation with \\nhim. His wife asked her about it. It was one night after her shift that she asked C.G. to \\npick up the pace and help out more around the restaurant, which conversation happened \\nwell before the incident. When asked about M.S., C.G. stated that M.S. would always bug \\nher and other servers about their work ethic. He would all the time give them little jabs, \\nbut it was never a conversation to ask them to work better or harder. \\n[40] \\nC.G. was asked in cross-examination on whether the appellant’s vehicle that night was a \\nF150 pickup truck rather than his Escalade, and she responded that she did not remember. \\nShe explained it was dark outside and what she remembered as “going into was their \\nCadillac Escalade, four-door truck”. It was presented to her that she was assuming, and \\nshe responded it was the Escalade. She presented as certain stating: “I know for a…fact it \\nwas.” The complainant did not recall making any comments to D.K.S. about him getting \\na new truck or him responding he was leasing it. She clarified it did not happen. When \\nasked again about the vehicle after a break, C.G. stated that she just remembered it being \\na black vehicle and him driving a black Escalade. She agreed she could not remember if \\nshe had her own vehicle that night. She was not absolutely sure that it was not a F150. \\n[41] \\nC.G. agreed that when the appellant handed her the box, his hands were underneath the \\nbox and that this was where she stated she placed her hands. When asked again later, \\nC.G. stated one of his hands was underneath the box and one was on top to give it to her. \\nBoth of her hands were underneath. She confirmed that she was suggesting that at the \\npoint when he handed her the box that he took away his hands and for about 30 seconds \\nhe touched her front with the back of his hand. She thought nothing of him taking his \\nhands away from the box until she turned around and he grabbed her buttocks. \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\n[42] \\nTo the suggestion that when they went back into the Establishment that C.G. told the \\nappellant that she will try to be better at work or something along those lines, she \\nresponded that she did not remember. When asked if it possible she did, she responded \\nthat she did not remember. \\n[43] \\nC.G. did not remember seeing M.S. in the kitchen when they came back inside. She \\nstated that he was always behind the bar. He never left the bar. He was the person that \\nwould make their drinks and so he was always behind the bar all the time. When it was \\nput to her that if M.S. said he was and saw her walk through that he would be wrong, she \\nresponded she was not sure. She explained that when something like that happens you \\ndon’t really recall. She just remembers getting walked outside. She agreed she presumed \\nthat M.S. was behind the bar because that is where he normally was. \\nEvidence of S.K. \\n[44] \\nS.K. worked with the complainant. She testified that she did not know the complainant \\nvery well, or outside of work and they rarely worked the same shifts, indicating it was “a \\ncouple of shifts.”  \\n[45] \\nS.K. testified that the appellant owned the Establishment but did not work there. Prior to \\nbeing employed by him, she knew him as her landlord and her husband’s boss. He came \\nto there to check up on it. He usually came on the weekend to supervise but sometimes \\nduring the week if there was an issue at the establishment.  \\n[46] \\nS.K. testified that the appellant was at the Establishment on May 15. He came during \\nafternoon, or evening sometime or all day but then changed to that she could not even \\nremember.  \\n[47] \\nS.K. recalled the Establishment not being busy; she and the complainant were working \\ntogether with M.S. and the cook. She stated that because it was not busy, the complainant \\nleft early. She identified M.S. as the manager and being there that evening, along with \\ncook, G.  \\n[48] \\nS.K. stated that the appellant was always appropriate and professional with her. He never \\nput her or ever saw him put anyone else in an uncomfortable position. She indicated that \\nhe never said anything inappropriate to her.  \\n[49] \\nS.K. confirmed she wrote a letter wherein she recalled that all had a meeting at work that \\nday about everybody, what needs to be improved – employer and employee. It was not \\nbasically only for C.G. It was for everybody else too. She recalled C.G. having a \\nconversation with the appellant but did not remember if it was about her work \\nperformance or about the event they were going to organize.  \\n[50] \\nS.K. recalled seeing C.G. for a few seconds before C.G. left that evening and C.G. \\npresented to her as bothered/upset. She had no idea why. She did not know why her letter \\ndid not include her observation of C.G. being upset but maintained that observation. \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\n[51] \\nS.K. recognized that the timing in her letter about when she saw C.G. and/or C.G. left \\nthat evening did not coincide with her trial testimony (namely, shortly after her shift, \\n“tenish” versus 11:30 p.m.) and apologized, stating that she did not remember the timing.  \\n[52] \\nS.K. did recall C.G. drinking some of her boyfriend’s drink before she left the \\nEstablishment. C.G. was only carrying a bag. \\nEvidence of M.S. \\n[53] \\nM.S. managed the Establishment for nine months—January to September in 2019. He \\nworked with the complainant in his capacity as manager from January of 2019 (when the \\nEstablishment opened) until the alleged incident in May of 2019.  \\n[54] \\nOn work performance, M.S. testified that the complainant sometimes was late, she was \\nnot doing her job properly, and she had issues with her co-workers. One concern included \\ndrinks missing from her shifts - he spoke to her a number of times about this issue.   \\n[55] \\nOn the night of the alleged incident, M.S. stated that he and cook, L. spoke to the \\nappellant about the complainant’s work performance, as M.S. put it: “[w]hat needs to be \\ndone or what not.” M.S. acknowledged that he had spoken to the appellant before about \\nissues. M.S. later overheard the appellant talk to the complainant about work issues in the \\nkitchen sometime around 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.; and stated that conversation lasted five \\nto six minutes. \\n[56] \\nAfter this said discussion that he overheard, M.S. stated that the appellant asked the \\ncomplainant to get the promotional materials from his vehicle, which M.S. said was \\nparked three or four feet from the back kitchen door. M.S. said the appellant usually \\ndrove a black Cadillac Escalade and parked at the back, but he did not see the vehicle on \\nMay 15, 2019.  \\n[57] \\nAs to what he saw related to retrieval of the boxes, M.S. testified that the complainant \\nmainly stayed at the back door to the kitchen while the appellant went to retrieve the \\nboxes; she might have stepped outside for “about two seconds” to get the boxes. He could \\nsee her through the screen door. He saw her take the boxes. He did not see anything \\nindicative of inappropriate touching. He acknowledged that there was a brief period of \\ntime when he could not see her, but she was only gone a few seconds. She came back into \\nthe kitchen with the boxes and took them into the bar area. The complainant stayed at the \\nEstablishment for about an hour before leaving. She had some drinks at the bar with a \\nfew people from town that he did not know—friends of hers. He later saw her take the \\nboxes with her when she left.  The appellant left about 10 to 20 minutes after the \\nappellant gave the complainant the boxes. The complainant appeared to be acting \\n“normal”. Before she left the Establishment, the complainant told M.S. that the work \\nissues were “not going to happen again” and she would “try to improve.”  \\n[58] \\nM.S. testified that he had never seen the appellant do anything inappropriate with any \\nstaff members.   \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n[59] \\nM.S. testified that there was a camera at the entrance to the bar, two in the kitchen, two in \\nthe bar area, one near the pool tables, and two in the main lobby. He said he never \\nchecked the cameras to see if the complainant was stealing or giving away alcohol, \\nbecause that would make the issue get “bigger.” He said the cameras did not record but \\nhe had a live mobile feed that could be accessed on his and the appellant’s cell phones. \\nThere was no system at the Establishment to review footage. He would have to watch \\nthrough the cameras in real time on his phone. He testified that he had watched servers \\n(not specifically the complainant) pour drinks for customers and not ring them in many \\ntimes. He would report this to the appellant. \\nEvidence of the Appellant \\n[60] \\nThe appellant testified. He denied the allegations. His first language is not English. He \\nchose to testify without the aid of an interpreter. Note: It is agreed by all that D.K.S. has a \\nvery strong accent.  \\n[61] \\nThe appellant at the time was a long-time businessman, who owned four or five \\nbusinesses in White River and Sault Ste. Marie, together with his wife, S.S.—including a \\nDays Inn, Soo Blaster (a sports bar), Taj (an Indian restaurant), A&W and the \\nEstablishment. He testified that he would attend the Establishment about once a week to \\ncheck up on the business (i.e., to go through the books and talk about issues, etc.), but the \\nday-to-day operations were handled by M.S..   \\n[62] \\nOn May 15, 2019, D.K.S. arrived at the Establishment and spoke with M.S., who raised \\nissues with the complainant’s work performance including drinking on the job, not \\nchecking identification, being late for work, and running short on inventory. He testified \\nthat the cook, L. was very upset with the complainant. M.S. could not handle it. The \\nappellant told M.S. that he would speak to the complainant. He spoke to the complainant \\nfor about 10 minutes about these issues. The appellant thought this conversation \\nhappened around 8:00 or 8:30pm. The complainant denied some of the concerns to him. \\nThe appellant told her: “this is last time, we can’t take it (sic) more longer”, but he did \\nnot fire her; it was agreed he gave her “a warning.” He stated she apologized and said she \\nwould change. He explained that part of the conversation included telling her that she \\nwas grown up and not to do that kind of stuff. He stated he told her “it has to be take final \\ndecisions. I told her that. I give her warning. Said, like, I had to make, uh, serious \\ndecisions”. \\n[63] \\nAfter the conversation, the appellant stated that he told the complainant about the \\nmaterials for the “Girls Night Out” promotion, which included coffee mugs and flyers. \\nThis was a different conversation that evening. He wanted the complainant to distribute \\nthese materials in Pic Mobert at the Days Inn and at a medical centre, where the \\ncomplainant worked a second job. Together they went to the back of the Establishment, \\nthrough the kitchen. The appellant went outside through the kitchen door. The \\ncomplainant did not come outside; she remained in the doorway. The appellant thought \\nthe kitchen door was closed when he went outside. \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\n[64] \\nThe appellant’s first words used to describe the location of the promotional items were \\n“that was in my truck”.  Next description was “I went to my truck…”. Next description, \\n“I went to my truck…” Next description “I opened the truck”. The next description, “Box \\nin my car. Backseat.” He was asked what it was, a car or truck. He answered “truck”. On \\ncross-examination, while giving evidence, he stated, “I went to the car”. Next, he stated \\n“she didn’t come to the truck.”. \\n[65] \\nThe appellant had testified that he was driving a rented truck that day, a Ford-150. He \\nnormally drove a Cadillac Escalade. However, the Cadillac was leased, and he was close \\nto the limit on his kilometers under his lease. He rented the truck to drive to his \\nbusinesses. The appellant testified that the complainant asked him whether he had a new \\nvehicle when she saw the truck. The promotional materials were on the truck’s back seat. \\nHe removed the boxes and handed them to her. He said his hands were on the sides of the \\nboxes. He did not touch her. He also denied touching her buttocks. The complainant took \\nthe box from the kitchen into the bar area; he believed she took them to her car, but he \\ndid not see that. The appellant left the Establishment shortly after giving her the boxes; at \\nmost he stayed for another 30 minutes.   \\nGENERAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES \\n[66] \\nReasonable doubt applies to the issue of credibility. On any given point, the trial judge \\nmay believe a witness, disbelieve a witness, or not be able to decide. The judge need not \\nfully believe or disbelieve one witness or a group of witnesses. If the judge has a \\nreasonable doubt about the accused’s guilt arising from the credibility of a/ witness/es, \\nthen he must find the accused not guilty. \\n[67] \\nReliability is a separate issue from credibility.  As noted by Watt, J.A. in R. v. C.(H.), \\n[2009] O.J. No. 214 (C.A.), credibility focuses on a witness’s veracity, while reliability \\nhas to do with the witness’s accuracy.  Accuracy involves the ability to observe, recall \\nand recount events that are in issue.  Of note, at para 41, the court wrote, “Any witness \\nwhose evidence on an issue is not credible cannot give reliable evidence on the same \\npoint.  Credibility, on the other hand, is not a proxy for reliability: a credible witness may \\ngive unreliable evidence.”  \\nLEAVE TO INTRODUCE FRESH EVIDENCE  \\nOverview \\n[68] \\nAn appellate court has broad discretion to receive fresh evidence on appeal where “it \\nconsiders it in the interests of justice”, based on the following criteria:  \\ni. Is the evidence admissible under the operative rules of evidence (admissibility \\ncriterion);  \\nii. Is the evidence sufficiently cogent in that it could reasonably be expected to \\nhave affected the verdict (cogency criterion); and,  \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\niii. What is the explanation offered for the failure to adduce the evidence at trial \\nand should that explanation affect the admissibility of the evidence (due diligence \\ncriterion)?  \\nThe due diligence criterion does not apply as strictly in criminal cases where liberty is at \\nstake:  Code, s. 683(1); R. v. L.C., 2021 ONCA 848, at para. 13; Palmer v. The Queen, \\n[1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775; R. v. Truscott, 2007 ONCA 575, at para. 92. \\n[69] \\nThe applicant seeks an order pursuant to the provisions of s. 683 of the Code that the \\naffidavit of R.B. and attached exhibit, namely, the rental agreement for the F-150 truck be \\nreceived and considered.  The appellant submits that the rental agreement supports his \\nevidence that he had rented and was driving an F-150 truck on May 15, 2019. \\nAdmissibility Criterion \\n[70] \\nThe respondent concedes the rental agreement would be admissible at trial and the \\nadmissibility criterion is established.  \\nCogency Criterion \\n[71] \\nI find the cogency criterion is met.  \\n[72] \\nAt paragraph 56 of his decision, the trial judge notes: “regarding the attendance at the \\nrear of the bar, it was put to C.G. that D.K.S. was driving a Ford F-150 truck as opposed \\nto his Cadillac Escalade. Her response was that she did not remember seeing a truck that \\nnight.  As for the suggestion that she had asked D.K.S. if he had a new vehicle, C.G. said \\nthat there was no such conversation.  She initially presented as certain. However, C.G. \\nwould go on to testify that she was not certain whether the truck in the back was the \\nCadillac Escalade or the Ford F-150.”  When pressed further, C.G. also testified that she \\ndid not remember commenting on whether D.K.S. had a new vehicle. Based on this, it is \\nclear to me that the trial judge was alive to the issue of the different evidence as to what \\nvehicle the appellant was driving and a consideration for him. \\n[73] \\nThe transcript of C.G.’s trial evidence at page 88 is as follows:  \\nQ: [C.G.], I think I was just asking you questions about the vehicle that \\n[D.K.S.] had out back, and I suggest to you it was a Ford F150, but you don’t \\nagree with that, right?  \\nA: No. I just remember it being a black vehicle and I just remember him driving \\na black Cadillac Escalade.  \\nQ: Okay. But you don’t even remember what if you had your own vehicle. \\nRight?  \\nA: Yes. \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\n Q: Okay. So, I take it then, my suggestion that it could have been an F150 you \\nare not absolutely sure about that?  \\nA: No.  \\n[74] \\nAt page 93, the trial evidence of C.G. is:  \\nQ: Right? You presume that [D.K.S.] had a Cadillac Escalade because that’s what \\nhe normally has. Right?  \\nA: Yeah. Because that’s… that was his normal vehicle at the time, and I don’t \\nremember asking him about what vehicle he was driving.   \\n[75] \\nThe evidence does present that the complainant was initially confident in her answer that \\nit was the appellant’s black Escalade, but that her confidence was diminished later in her \\ncross-examination.  By the end of her cross-examination, she was “not absolutely sure” \\nthat it was not an F150, only that she “remembers it being a black vehicle”.   \\n[76] \\nRegarding the vehicle being operated by the appellant May 15, 2019, the trial judge does \\nmake specific reference to the different evidence regarding the vehicle, writing the \\nfollowing:  \\nC.G. testified that the accused had his Cadillac Escalade at the back of the bar. \\nAs noted earlier, when pressed on this issue she was less than certain about that \\nrecollection. D.K.S. gave evidence that he had a rented Ford F-150 truck on this \\ndate. He explained that he did so because the Cadillac Escalade was leased, and \\nhe was being cognizant of the mileage on that leased vehicle. However, this \\ncourt notes the following additional evidence on this point:  \\na) At one point, during his examination in-chief, the accused said that \\nhe took the box of promotional items from his “car”. It was then at the \\nspecific invitation of his counsel that the accused said that the items \\nwere taken from the “truck”.  \\nb) M.S. gave evidence about the location of the vehicle behind the \\nbusiness. After he acknowledged that he had not seen the vehicle being \\nused by the accused, M.S. said that he had seen D.K.S. in White River \\ndriving either the Cadillac Escalade or white SUV that belonged to his \\nwife. If D.K.S. was concerned about mileage on the leased Cadillac, is \\nthere a reason that he did not drive his wife’s SUV to White River as \\nopposed to renting another vehicle?  \\n[77] \\nIn fairness to the trial judge, it was the Crown who specifically raised the evidence about \\nthe vehicle during submissions after trial and not just in passing. The Crown was \\nidentifying same as one of very few contradictory statements in her evidence, inviting the \\njudge to consider same. \\n[78] \\nThe trial judge’s comments as set out above, in my view, objectively present as if he was \\nassessing the veracity of the appellant’s evidence, both when he made the comment about \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nusing the word “car” and querying as to why the appellant would not have been using his \\nwife’s vehicle (side note: he was not even asked that question). It is fair to state that as \\nwritten, the comments present as a discrepancy or contradictory evidence he was trying to \\nresolve, in comparing versions - an exercise in assessing credibility and reliability, a main \\nissue at this trial. It is fair to state that it presents as though the trial judge was assessing \\nactual words used by the appellant and his evidence on what he stated he was driving. \\nThe last line of the trial judge’s decision on this point presents objectively as questioning \\nthe evidence of the appellant that he had in fact rented and/or was driving a rental truck \\nthat day. In my view, there is no other alternative interpretation for its inclusion. He \\npresents as questioning why the appellant would rent a vehicle when his wife had one. He \\nis questioning the appellant’s evidence, thus credibility and reliability of his evidence. \\nSide note:  the appellant testified that his wife was not with him that day. \\n[79] \\nFurther, the appellant used the word “truck” more than once before the evidence he gave \\nwhen he used the word “car” as identified by the trial judge. Therefore, in my view, it \\nwould not be fair to state that there was a “change” at the specific invitation of his \\ncounsel. Further, I do not think it fair to find that the appellant meant the Cadillac when \\none adds consideration of the language used by the appellant throughout the trial. He \\nused wrong words and/or incorrect grammar, more than once. It in my view was evident \\nthat at times he struggled in putting together his evidence in English. \\n[80] \\nWhile I agree that the rental agreement would not confirm that D.K.S. was, in fact, \\ndriving a black Ford F150 on May 15, 2019, it certainly shows that he had rented a Ford \\nF150 in that time frame.  The trial judge may not have doubted the appellant’s version \\nhad the rental agreement been tendered and it is not clear how important this was in the \\nassessment of the appellant’s evidence.  At the very least, the only reasonable \\ninterpretation in the passage about the vehicle was that there was a negative impact on \\nthat issue/question as to his veracity.  \\nDue Diligence Criterion \\n[81] \\nThe respondent submits that the appellant clearly had the rental agreement in his \\npossession at the time of the trial – it was not kept from him, or lost, or unavailable. \\n[82] \\nThe appellant in explaining his decision for not tendering the rental agreement at trial \\nstates that he “was not aware that this would take on such importance at his trial”. I \\naccept this. In this situation, D.K.S. was testifying that he was driving the truck, and the \\nevidence by the point he testified, included C.G. going from being certain to not \\nremembering, and no other witness knowing. \\n[83] \\nIt would not have been an obligation on the appellant to prove he was driving the Ford-\\n150, only to raise doubt with respect to the evidence/credibility/reliability, in the context \\nof a case that included assertion of motive to fabricate related to employment discipline \\non the part of the complainant, and a case where it was also submitted the complainant \\nchanged her evidence, or could not remember events, and/or exaggerated and/or \\nconfirmed previous evidence as assumptions, and/or was contradicted by other witness \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\nevidence including but not limited to how many times she worked with S.K, complaints \\nmade about her, where people were and what they were doing, a staff meeting that \\nevening, and what she herself was driving or if she had her own vehicle.  This is not to be \\ntaken as this court stating that the evidence of the complainant is not credible. That is not \\nmy task. I do so to look at the context and the Crown argument on the appellant not \\ntendering the rental agreement. \\n[84] \\nThe respondent submits that the vehicle being driven by D.K.S. was not a central issue in \\nthis trial and challenges the submission that same took on “importance”.  The Crown \\nsubmits it only became an issue because of the defence strategy to cross-examine the \\ncomplainant at length about the make and model of the vehicle.  \\n[85] \\nThe respondent further submits that the appellant’s position is contrary to the defence \\nstrategy at trial, which involved cross-examination of the complainant about the make \\nand model of the vehicle he was driving.  The make and model of the vehicle being \\ndriven was brought up in passing by the respondent, when C.G. was describing the \\ndiagram of the scene that she had drawn.  During the Crown questioning the following \\nexchange occurred:  \\n[Crown].   Is that right? Okay. And so, the dumpster speaks for itself. The car is \\nD.K.S.’s car?  \\nA.   Yes.  \\nQ.   What type of car or vehicle is that?  \\nA.   Um, I, I think it was an Escalade. Like, a, an SUV Escalade. \\nQ.   Can you help us with the colour?  \\nA.   Um, black. It was a Cadillac Escalade.  \\n[86] \\nThere are approximately five pages of transcript evidence of cross-examination of C.G. \\non the make and model of the car, and whether she was certain it was the black Cadillac, \\nbut again, the context was as outlined by me above. \\n[87] \\nWith the greatest of respect, while I agree that this was an issue that arose during the trial, \\nin my view, the Crown spent more than passing time on this issue in submissions. If I had \\nbeen the trial judge, based on the Crown submissions, I would have interpreted, as it \\nappears the trial judge did, that this was an issue to consider/reconcile when analyzing \\ncredibility and reliability - invited by the Crown. The defence submissions did not \\nhighlight the vehicle. \\n[88] \\nThe Crown argued that the appellant’s evidence ought not to be accepted or believed. The \\nCrown also raised the issue of the credibility of C.G. stating that the only real \\ninconsistency the Crown could see was with respect to her description of the black \\nEscalade as being the vehicle that the appellant was driving.   In this context, the Crown \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\nraises that the appellant first described the vehicle as being the Escalade but changed. The \\npoint is that the Crown made it an issue as to what vehicle was being driven in analyzing \\ninconsistencies of C.G. and identifying same as an issue of credibility – “That’s simply a \\ncredibility issue of who do you believe when they describe the vehicle that they think he \\nwas driving on, on that particular day”. It was one of two times the Crown submitted that \\nC.G. changed her evidence. The second was the timing issue in respect to the alleged \\nfrontal contact of her body which was suggested to be a qualification of the initial time \\nframe provided. \\n[89] \\nFor all these reasons, I grant leave to admit the evidence on the appeal. \\nDid the trial judge erroneously discount a significant inconsistency in the complainant’s \\nevidence based on inapplicable principles involving delayed disclosure and sexual \\nstereotypes?    \\n[90] \\nThe appellant submits that the trial judge fell into error in the manner in which he \\naddressed a significant inconsistency in the complainant’s evidence about the first \\nallegation of sexual touching, when the appellant handed her the promotional material \\nboxes; that the trial judge had trouble with the length of the touching and the physical \\nimpossibility of it taking 20 to 30 seconds and; the trial judge resolved this inconsistency \\nby relying on the jurisprudence involving delayed disclosure.   \\n[91] \\nWhile acknowledging that the judge went on to provide a number of reasons why she \\nmight have gotten this detail wrong, including her age, background and her employment \\nrelationship, among others, the appellant submits none of these factors explained the \\nmajor inconsistency; the principles around delayed disclosure, and the importance of not \\nrelying on sexual stereotypes, in no way negates a significant inconsistency in the \\ncomplainant’s version of events that was part of the actus reus.  The timing of the \\ntouching – around 30 (20-30) seconds – defies common sense both in terms of the length \\nof the touching generally and her evidence that she was unsure whether the touching was \\naccidental or intentional; and as such, the trial judge’s approach to resolving material \\ninconsistency amounts to a legal error.   \\n[92] \\nThe respondent submits that the appellant’s submissions mischaracterize the reasoning of \\nthe trial judge; contrary to the appellant’s position, the trial judge was not concerned with \\nthe length of time that the physical touching occurred, or of the physical impossibility of \\nit taking that long; the trial judge was considering a very different question: namely, \\nwhether it is credible that it could have taken the complainant 20-30 seconds before she \\nrealized the touching was of a sexual nature; and the trial judge specifically poses this as \\nthe question that he will be asking at the beginning of this section of analysis, writing, “Is \\nit beyond credible that such touching could occur for 20 to 30 seconds without the \\ncomplainant understanding what was occurring [ emphasis mine]?  There are a number of \\nfactors to consider in making this assessment.”   \\n[93] \\nI agree reviewing the decision that in the context of a credibility assessment, that the trial \\njudge considered cases about delayed disclosure as they relate to the credibility \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\nassessment of sexual assault victims, in the context of explaining that victims of sexual \\nassault may experience those sexual assaults differently depending on a number of factors \\nunique to them, and that courts should not jump to stereotypes about how victims of \\nsexual assaults will react and was dealing with the issue identified by the Crown.  \\nParagraph 155 of the decision acknowledges that the case is not one of delayed \\ndisclosure.  However, he was assessing her evidence. The trial judge states at paragraphs \\n157 and 158, “Thus, the complainant’s purported reactions must be assessed based on \\nevidence in the trial as opposed to some predetermined or standardized response.  In that \\nregard, there are characteristics of C.G. that must be considered...”   \\n[94] \\nIn paragraph 158, the trial judge outlines a number of factors about C.G. and her \\nrelationship to the accused that he considered relevant in considering her reaction, \\nincluding her age and background, her relationship to Mr. and Ms. D.K.S., her \\nemployment, her background circumstances, and immediate circumstances, as well as her \\nreaction to the incident.  All of these factors were considered to determine whether it was \\ncredible for C.G. to state that she was not sure if the touching was accidental or \\nintentional despite it lasting 20 – 30 seconds.   \\n[95] \\nThe issue I have is the actual evidence.  She stated that she knew when he touched her \\nbuttocks, twice – which is before she re-entered the Establishment. She also gave \\ncontradictory evidence as to when she states she discussed the incident with J. First it was \\noutside at her vehicle when putting the boxes in same, then it changed to as soon as she \\ngot back in the Establishment inside the Establishment before going outside. What I \\nunderstand the appellant to be arguing is that this was a major point of evidence in the \\ncontext she described as a hand over of boxes, the timing of the swiping, when she started \\nto turn, whether she just kept walking or turned back to look at him after he touched her \\nbuttocks. Thirty seconds is objectively in this context not a short time. There was other \\nevidence to consider that came from the complainant herself. In my view, all the \\nforegoing was relevant evidence to consider in the analysis, namely – what she actually \\nthought and when – when trying to analyze what she was understanding or understood.  \\nIn my view, as such, an error arises.   \\nMISAPPREHENSION OF EVIDENCE \\nGeneral \\n[96] \\nA conviction that rests on a material misapprehension of the evidence cannot stand.  \\nHowever, it is not enough for an appellant to show that the trial judge simply made a \\nmistake in his view of the evidence.   \\n[97] \\nTo succeed on this ground of appeal, an appellant must show that the trial judge made a \\nmaterial misapprehension that went to the substance of the evidence and the reasoning \\nprocess resulting in the conviction.  This is a stringent standard, but an appellant does not \\nneed to show that he would have been acquitted but for the misapprehension.  If the \\nmisapprehension could have affected the outcome, then the verdict must be set aside.  It \\ndoes not matter whether the rest of the evidence was capable of supporting the verdict, as \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\na misapprehension impacts trial fairness:  R. v. Lohrer, 2004 SCC 80, at para. 2, citing R. \\nv. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Smith, 2021 SCC 16 at para 2; \\nand R. v. Scott, 2022 ONCA 317 at para. 29.  \\nDid the trial judge misapprehend M.S.’s evidence?  \\n[98] \\nThe appellant submits that it was never directly suggested to M.S. that he could not see \\noutside, or that the door blocked his vantage point or that C.G.’s body blocked his \\nvantage point, to provide him the opportunity to even provide an explanation.  This is \\ncorrect. \\n[99] \\nAt paragraph 136 the trial judge held,  \\nM.S. also testified in-chief that C.G. was at the back door and that she might \\nhave left the building for two seconds in order to grab the box.  He was able to \\nobserve this because she could be seen “easily” through the outer screen door.  \\nHowever, when that evidence was tested in cross-examination, MS. \\nacknowledged that when D.K.S. went out to get the box there was a time when \\nM.S. could not see the accused.  Thus, at best, this witness would have seen \\nC.G.’s back through the screen door thereby resulting in her body blocking \\nM.S.’s view of the accused.  Even when she turned to re-enter the building her \\nbody would have been between M.S. and D.K.S.  Thus, his observations of the \\naccused were very limited, particularly in relation to whether the accused’s \\nhand was touching the front of C.G.’s body.   \\n[100] First, the timing of the touching was in issue, whether what C.G. states happened. Seeing \\nher clearly is not necessarily the issue. He saw her step out very briefly in comparison to \\nthe length of time she described for the three touches. One touch she describes as 30, then \\n20 to 30 seconds, then “quick and brief” outside but maintaining 20-30 seconds. Two \\nother touches are seconds after she turned around. The point is that although M.S. agreed \\nthat she could have been out of his view, he described it as only seconds, which does not \\ncontradict the appellant’s evidence that the complainant stepped outside of the door \\nbriefly to get the box from him, and that she stayed mainly in the doorway. M.S. not \\nbeing able to see what was going on, does not translate to him not being able to give \\nreliable evidence as to how long she was actually outside. \\n[101] There were discrepancies as to if the complainant had stepped outside to D.K.S.’s vehicle \\nat all. In the trial submissions, the issue of where C.G was at the relevant time was in \\nissue, namely standing by the door or outside – and whether the door was open or closed. \\n[102] For these reasons, I am of the view an error was made and the evidence misapprehended.   \\nDid the trial judge apply proper care to the Appellant’s language difficulties?  \\n[103] The appellant submits that the trial judge found inconsistencies in the appellant’s \\nevidence, that were not argued; and the trial judge did not give the appellant a chance to \\nexplain.  The appellant points to para. 126 of the decision where the trial judge noted:  \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\n...In addition, the accused testified that when he gave the box to C.G. she was \\nsitting.  There is no evidence that there was anything in the doorway upon \\nwhich she could have been seated.  How would it have been possible for her to \\nbe seated n the doorway if the doors were closed?  Moreover, the version of the \\nevents in which C.G. was seated at the door was never put to her.  These \\ncontradictions in his evidence are significant and undermine his credibility.   \\n[104] The evidence of the appellant in-chief was:  \\nQ.  And go slowly.  Just tell the court what you did?  \\nA.  So, I took the box, and I gave it to C.G. \\nQ.  Yes.  \\nA.  She was sitting by the door.   \\n[105] The appellant submits that it was abundantly clear that English was not the appellant’s \\nfirst language; an interpreter did not aid him at trial; the appellant also used the word \\n“sitting” to describe the positions of other people during his trial evidence, in situations \\nwhere it was unlikely that they were actually sitting as opposed to standing; and this was \\na single word he used in his testimony without context. I agree. \\n[106] The appellant asserts legal error; namely that care must be applied to assessing credibility \\nof a witness whose first language is not English, where he or she speaks with a heavy \\naccent or uses an odd choice of words.  I agree. \\n[107] It is a misapprehension of evidence, in failing to give language issues proper effect, by \\nrelying on something innocuous to undercut the appellant’s credibility and not applying \\nthe proper care to the appellant’s evidence given language difficulties:  R. v. Hubbs, 2014 \\nONCJ 32 at paras. 169-170; R. v. Ghani, 2015 ABPC 136, at paras. 78-79; Fu v. Zhu, \\n2018 BCSC 9 at paras. 39-42.  \\n[108] The respondent concedes that English is not the appellant’s first language, and that he did \\ntestify with an accent at trial but asserts that this does not mean that his evidence can \\nsimply be re-interpreted in a manner that benefits him. There was nothing in the context \\nof D.K.S.’s evidence that should have caused the trial judge to be concerned that D.K.S. \\ndid not mean “sitting” when he said “sitting”.   \\n[109] In the context of the whole of the appellant’s evidence, I disagree. It was much more than \\nsimply that the appellant “spoke with an accent”. He used wrong words. He sometimes \\nexcludes articles, verbs. He does not always pluralize. There were various language \\nissues I noted. There were many examples of use of broken English during the course of \\nhis evidence. I reproduce some examples, just to demonstrate: \\n1. Q. Okay. And how many employees were employed at that place on May 15th, \\n2019? \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\nA. I am not exactly correct. I am thinking around eight people. \\n2. MR. CARTER: Q. And Manpreet Singh, what was his job? \\nA. He is the, entitled to manager. You are doing bar and also you are doing \\nsome days bar, and you are taking care of the bar overall. \\n \\n3. Q. Okay. And how long have you known [CG]? \\n \\nA. So, we moved to White River 2011, July. Since that point because it’s small \\ntown, we know. \\n \\n4. Q. Okay. And I want to take you back to May 15th, 2019. We have heard from \\nwitnesses what took place on that day from their point of view. When - do you \\nremember at what time did you arrive that day at the White River Bar & \\nGrill? \\n \\nA. Not exactly sure. I am thinking around seven o'clock, afternoon. After my \\ndone the A&W things, I went to the bar. \\n \\n5. Q. And what do you normally do when you visit, I think you said once a week, \\nwhat do you normally when you go? \\n \\nA. Just collecting, uh, all the papers and paperworks and anything, any new we \\nare want come to promote some new wines and talking to the issues with \\nthe employees, things, or anything like that. Small thing. Mostly manager \\nwill take care. \\n \\n6. A. Yeah. Inventory. \\n \\nQ. What does that mean? \\n \\nA. That’s mean we, every day we, bartender, every day we are counting the \\nbottles. \\n \\nQ. Counting the bottles. \\n \\nA. Yeah. Whenever she working, the bottle is short. \\n \\n7. Q. So, you didn’t actually think she was stealing alcohol from you then? You \\ndidn’t think that was true? \\n \\nA. Um, because, um, we know a little bit because she never punched in person. \\nWe have a rules, policies. Everybody before take any beer or anything, they \\nhave to, must punch it in the PO system. She never does it. Every time \\nManpreet has to remind her. She take the bottle and give it to the people, \\ncustomer, without punch it in. So, that’s, uh, only person she is, the one \\nwho is doing that.  \\n \\nQ. I see. So, you didn’t think she was stealing alcohol. You just thought she \\nwas giving it to the customers without typing it into the system correctly? \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\n \\nA. Yeah. End of the day they are giving her extra tips because she not punch it \\nin. \\n \\nQ. Sorry. I didn’t understand that last thing you said. \\n \\nA. So, end of the day, they giving extra tips, tipping out because she is not \\npunching in and extra tips her friends come or anybody comes because she \\nknows she is supposed to punch it in. The friends coming in so she just standing \\nall the beer without punch it in. So, our inventory short. \\n \\n \\n[110] Further, the “sitting” was not the only description the appellant gave as to C.G. location \\nin his evidence. He did say she was sitting by the door. But he would also testify during \\nthe course of his evidence that C.G. was by the door, just by the door, inside the door. I \\ndid not see that any witness was asked if there was a stool or chair to sit on in the area of \\nthe back door. When describing the event to get the boxes and give them to C.G., the \\nappellant states “less than 30 minute or 30 seconds”. “Just she was walking middle of the \\nkitchen”. Another example that he did not always use words correctly when trying to \\ncommunicate and may not meant to use the word “sitting”, the way it was interpreted. \\n[111] In fairness to the trial judge, I recognize that part of defence submissions at trial included \\npresenting that the appellant’s language skills were very good, but defence did outline \\nthat his accent was sometimes hard to understand which should not be taken as a \\ncredibility issue. Defence acknowledged that hearing with the accent is sometimes more \\ndifficult, but that the appellant understood and there was nothing in his evidence to take \\naway from his credibility in his expressions that he did not touch C.G. \\n[112] \\nI am not concluding that his English is poor and that is not my task, because it is not. The \\npoint is isolating language used and determining if that is an error.  There was enough, in \\nmy view in this case, in fairness to the applicant, that isolating certain words should have \\nbeen something the trial judge should have been cautious of, especially when he was not \\nasked to explain what he meant  and no one was asked what was by the door. The bottom \\nline for me, reviewing the transcript, assuming it is prepared accurately, the appellant \\npresents as understandable, but his English is certainly not perfect.  \\nDid the trial judge fail to address good character evidence resulting in a failure to deal with \\nmaterial evidence?  \\n[113] Justice Hill summarized in R. v. Khan: \\nThe trial judge accepted that evidence of good character was led through the \\nappellant’s own testimony which can stand as a legitimate source for such \\ninformation: R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at para. 31. In appropriate cases, \\ngood character evidence may be sufficient of itself to raise a reasonable doubt: \\nR. v. Smith (2001), 161 C.D.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 99-101. \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\nWhere good character evidence is properly admitted, it may be capable (1) of \\nsupporting the accused’s credibility as a witness and (2) may circumstantially \\nenhance the improbability that he or she committed the offence(s) charged: R. v. \\nCharlebois, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 674, at para. 29; R. v. Sheriffe, 2015 ONCA 880, at \\npara. 69 (leave to appeal refused [2016] S.C.CA. No. 299); R. v. F.E.E., 2011 \\nONCA 783, at para. 67; R. v. Dees (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 58 (Ont. C.A.), at p. \\n65:  R. v. Khan, 2017 ONSC 7109 at paras. 77-78.   \\n[114] Character evidence relates to the one’s reputation within the community such that they \\nare not the sort of person who would commit the crime in question.  I agree that a wtiness \\nsimply stating that they were not sexually assaulted is not the same thing as saying, “the \\nappellant is not the sort of person who would commit a sexual assault.” \\n[115] The appellant is arguing that there are three sources of character evidence relating to \\nD.K.S. that were introduced at the trial:  \\n(a) \\nFirst, D.K.S.’s claims that he is a successful businessman with a wife and \\nkids;  \\n(b) \\nSecond, S.K.’s evidence that D.K.S. had never sexually assaulted her; and  \\n(c) \\nThird, M.S.’s evidence that he never saw D.K.S. be inappropriate with any \\nemployees.   \\n[116] The appellant acknowledges at paragraph 37 of his factum notes that the Supreme Court \\nhas noted the limited weight that may be ascribed to cases of sexual assault as \\nperpetrators of sexual assault often come before the court with good reputations within \\nthe community and with an unblemished criminal record.   \\n[117] Evidence of good character may be entitled to less weight:  R. v. Profit, [1992] O.J. No. \\n2238 (C.A.), per Griffiths J.A., aff’d by R. v. Profit, [1993] 3S.C.R. 637.   \\n[118] However, the appellant submits that in the reasons for judgment the trial judge did not \\navert to the “good character” aspect of the evidence, nor did he indicate whether this \\nfavourably impacted the appellant’s credibility, or whether this evidence standing alone \\ncould have led to reasonable doubt; and that this amounts to a legal error.   \\n[119] The appellant further states the trial judge seemed to use good character evidence against \\nthe appellant, noting that his evidence on this issue was “marginally responsive to the \\nallegations against him that are alleged to have occurred in less than one minute”, which \\nin the appellant’s submission, misses its probative value.  \\n[120] The appellant testified that he was a successful businessman who would not have \\ncommitted this offence because he had a wife and three kids; and that witnesses that \\nworked with the appellant – M.S. and S.K. – all testified they had never seen the \\napplicant act inappropriate towards female staff members; and that the defence made \\narguments about good character in submissions.  \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\n[121] The respondent concedes that at the very least that D.K.S.’s evidence is properly \\ndescribed as character evidence.   In response to being asked if he touched C.G. for a \\nsexual purpose he stated: “No, sir.  It’s untrue.  I have three kids.  My wife and, uh, I \\ndon’t have a time for these, uh, unnecessary things.  I am running four, five businesses.”   \\n[122] Defence did raise for the court’s consideration, in trial submissions, the fact that S.K. \\nnever noted any inappropriate behaviour on the part of the appellant. \\n[123] This piece of D.K.S.’s evidence was specifically addressed by the trial judge at paragraph \\n130 of the decision. The trial judge found that “I don’t have time for these unnecessary \\nthings” is not a reasonable excuse to rebut a sexual assault that lasted lass than one \\nminute. This was not, for example, an allegation of an ongoing affair or long-term sexual \\nassault that would have been impacted by his time constraints.  \\n[124] I agree that a trial judge is not required to examine every piece of evidence in detail. The \\ntrial judge by his reasons does demonstrate that he considered character evidence.  What \\nhe did consider he discounted for reasons stated.  He was not required to set out all \\ncharacter evidence.   \\nCONCLUSION \\n[125] I have made findings of error.  Accordingly, for the reasons articulated above, I find these \\nerrors are of a degree to allow the appeal.  The appeal is allowed, the conviction is \\nquashed, and I order a new trial.  \\n[126] This matter is remanded to April 10, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. to address the cross-appeal. \\n \\n \\n  Rasaiah J.  \\n \\n \\nReleased: March 28, 2024 \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1865 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nCITATION: R. v.

After his arrest, police searched his car and located a leather \\nsatchel in the rear passenger side footwell of the car.  The satchel contained a loaded restricted \\nhandgun, cocaine and cannabis.   Mr. Morrison was charged with obstructing police, possession \\nof cocaine and various offences relating to the gun, including possession of a loaded, restricted \\nfirearm. \\n[2]      Mr. Morrison, who is Black, alleged that he was stopped by the arresting officer as a result \\nof racial profiling.  He also argued that his arrest was in breach of s. 9 of the Canadian Charter \\nof Rights and Freedoms (Charter) and that the search of his vehicle was in violation of s. 8 of \\nthe Charter.  Mr. Morrison argued that the evidence of the gun and drugs found in the vehicle \\nshould be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter because its admission would bring the \\nadministration of justice into disrepute. \\n[3]      In the alternative, if this Court does not find that any of the Charter breaches have been \\nmade out or that the evidence should not be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2), Mr. Morrison argued \\nthat the Crown has not proven that he was in possession of the gun and drugs because the Crown \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nhas not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the gun and drugs were in the vehicle \\nand that he exercised control over them. \\n[4]      For the reasons that follow, I find that there is insufficient evidence to allow me to conclude, \\non a balance of probabilities, that racial profiling played a role in the police investigation of \\nCurtis Morrison.   \\n[5]      I find that the arrest of Mr. Morrison was not valid and violated his s. 9 Charter rights.  \\nAccordingly, I find that the search of his vehicle violated his s. 8 Charter rights because it was \\nnot done pursuant to a valid arrest and there was no other lawful purpose for the search \\narticulated by the police. \\n[6]      I find that the evidence should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. \\n[7]      Given my findings on the Charter applications, it is not necessary for me to make a finding \\nas to whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Curtis Morrison possessed \\nthe gun and drugs.  However, in the event that I am wrong in any or all of my Charter analyses, \\nI would find that the Crown has not proven possession beyond a reasonable doubt. \\n \\nThe racial profiling allegation \\nWhat is racial profiling and how does a court decide if it has occurred? \\n[8]      The Ontario Court of Appeal has defined and provided a framework for the analysis of \\nracial profiling allegations as follows1: \\nRacial profiling is criminal profiling based on race. Racial or colour profiling \\nrefers to that phenomenon whereby certain criminal activity is attributed to \\nan identified group in society on the basis of race or colour resulting in the \\ntargeting of individual members of that group. In this context, race is \\nillegitimately used as a proxy for the criminality or general criminal \\npropensity of an entire racial group.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n….. \\nA racial profiling claim could rarely be proven by direct evidence. This \\nwould involve an admission by a police officer that he or she was influenced \\nby racial stereotypes in the exercise of his or her discretion to stop a motorist. \\nAccordingly, if racial profiling is to be proven it must be done by inference \\ndrawn from circumstantial evidence. . .. [W]here the evidence shows that the \\ncircumstances relating to a detention correspond to the phenomenon of racial \\nprofiling and provide a basis for the court to infer that the police officer is \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 R. v. Brown, [2003] O.J. No. 1251 (C.A.). \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nlying about why he or she singled out the accused person for attention, the \\nrecord is then capable of supporting a finding that the stop was based on \\nracial profiling.  \\n[9]      The following additional points were made by the Ontario Court of Appeal that bear upon \\nthe analysis in this case: \\n1. The attitude that underlies racial profiling may be consciously or \\nunconsciously held.  Consequently, a police officer need not be an overt \\nracist to engage in conduct based on unconscious racial stereotyping.2 \\n2. A police officer who stops a motorist based on their race or colour has no \\narticulable cause for the stop.3 \\n3. A racial profiling claim is rarely going to be proved through direct \\nevidence.  That would require an admission by the officer that racial \\nstereotypes influenced the decision to stop the accused.  Accordingly, if \\nracial profiling is to be proven, it “must be done by inference drawn from \\ncircumstantial evidence.”4  \\n4. One way of proving racial profiling is to compare the facts with the \\nindicia of racial profiling to provide a basis for the inference that the \\nofficer is untruthful about why the plaintiff was singled out.  The record \\nis then “capable of supporting” a finding of racial profiling.5 \\n[10] \\nIt is not necessary to find that an officer is lying about the reason for stopping the accused.  \\nIndeed, the officer may be genuinely unaware of the effect of subconscious biases that may \\nhave influenced his attention being drawn to the accused.  The focus of the analysis is not on \\nwhether the officer has been demonstrated to have misled the court.  It is on whether “the \\ncircumstances give the court a basis upon which to reject the officer’s evidence as untrue \\nbecause they are indicative of racial profiling.”6 \\n[11] \\nAs the Ontario Court of Appeal put it in R. v. Sitladeen:7 \\n \\nThis approach to the correspondence test is consistent with the concept of \\nunconscious bias, where a person either does not recognize, or does not \\nacknowledge his own bias. An officer who has unconsciously allowed racial \\nstereotypes to influence his decision to detain a racialized person may not \\nbelieve he is being untruthful, and therefore may not be lying when he testifies \\nthat racial stereotypes played no role in the decision. Nevertheless, a trial \\n                                                 \\n \\n2 R. v. Brown, supra, para. 8. \\n3 R. v. Brown, supra, para. 10. \\n4 R. v. Brown, supra, para. 44. \\n5 R. v. Brown, supra, para. 133. \\n6 R. v. Sitladeen, 2021 ONCA 303. \\n7 R. v. Sitladeen, supra, para. 49. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\njudge is entitled to reject that evidence as untruthful, if the judge is satisfied, \\nbased on the circumstances consistent with racial profiling, that unconscious \\nbias and racial profiling were factors in the decision. \\n[12] \\nFurther, even if it is demonstrated that the officer had objective grounds for the arrest, the \\ndefect in the arrest created by racial profiling is not cured.  If racial profiling is found to have \\nplayed a role, to any degree, in the officer’s selection of the accused as a suspect or his treatment \\nof the suspect, the arrest is unlawful.8 \\n[13] \\nIn summary: \\nthere are two components to racial profiling. The first is the attitudinal \\ncomponent, which is the acceptance by a person in authority that race or \\nracial stereotypes are relevant in identifying the propensity to offend or to \\nbe dangerous. The second is the causation component, which requires that \\nthis race-based thinking consciously or unconsciously motivate or \\ninfluence, to any degree, decisions by persons in authority in suspect \\nselection or subject treatment.9 \\n \\nThe evidence relating to racial profiling in this case \\n[14] \\nOn November 15, 2021, OPP Cst. White was working alone, in uniform, on patrol in a \\nmarked police car.  He had been a police officer for about two and a half years, having been \\nhired by the OPP in April 2019. \\n[15] \\nAt approximately 8:00 p.m., Cst. White went to the On Route on the eastbound 401, going \\ntowards Long Sault, Ontario.  He went to the On Route to conduct traffic enforcement \\ninvestigations as he often did when it was not a busy night.  Cst. White testified that he was \\nplanning to run license plate checks, look for traffic violations, suspended drivers and other \\ncriminal offences. \\n[16] \\nThe parking lot at the On Route was “not too busy”.  It was a Monday night.  Cst. White \\ndescribed it as a “slow night” at the On Route. \\n[17] \\nCst. White testified that at 8:08 p.m., he observed “a vehicle that was getting gas.”  Cst. \\nWhite was parked in the parking lot in front of the main On Route building where the restaurants \\nand washrooms are.  He described himself as being parked approximately in the middle of the \\ndistance between the gas station and the main On Route building. \\n[18] \\nCst. White testified that he did not recall any other cars being in the gas station pumping \\ngas at the time.  Cst. White said that it was not a busy night at the On Route based on the number \\n                                                 \\n \\n8 R. v. Dudhi, 2019 ONCA 665, para. 62-63. \\n9 R. v. Dudhi, supra, para. 66. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nof cars in the parking lot.  He said he did not recall whether the car he noted pumping gas was \\nthe only car in the parking lot though he acknowledged that there would possibly have been \\nother cars there, associated with the employees of the On Route.  Cst. White did not check the \\nlicense plates of any other vehicles in the parking lot.   \\n[19] \\nCst. White entered the license plate of Mr. Morrison’s vehicle into his computer and \\nlearned that the registered owner of the vehicle was wanted out of the province of Quebec and \\nwas flagged as being possibly armed and dangerous as a result of having been convicted of \\n“robberies.”  The terms relating to the warrant were in French.  Cst. White speaks French but \\nwas not familiar with the terms he saw on his computer, so he Googled them on his phone.  \\nUltimately, Cst. White determined that the warrant was what he described as “a tax warrant.”   \\n[20] \\nCst. White testified that he decided at this point that he was going to conduct a traffic stop \\nto determine if the driver of the vehicle was the registered owner and, if he was, Cst. White was \\ngoing to arrest him on the strength of the “tax warrant.”  Cst. White did not recall whether the \\nwarrant was endorsed or not, to allow an officer from outside of Quebec to execute it.  Cst. \\nWhite also testified that in most cases, when he sees information about an outstanding warrant \\non CPIC on his computer, it lists the charge that the warrant is outstanding for, together with \\nthe warrant.  In this case, Cst. White did not recall whether there was a specific criminal charge \\nlisted and he testified that he had not written anything down about a charge in his notes. \\n[21] \\nCst. White looked at his onboard mapping system and saw that his colleague Cst. Kelly \\nwas close by.  Cst. White called Cst. Kelly and told him that he had a vehicle with the registered \\nowner wanted out of Quebec with “several flags and a history of robbery and firearms.”  Cst. \\nWhite asked Cst. Kelly to attend at the On Route to assist him with the traffic stop. \\n[22] \\nThe male who had been putting gas into the vehicle then went into the gas station, paid for \\nthe gas, got into the car, drove around the parking lot and then parked in front of the main On \\nRoute building where the restaurants and washrooms are.  The male then got out of the vehicle \\nand went inside the building.  The male later returned and got into the driver’s side of the \\nvehicle.  At all times, the male was the lone occupant of the vehicle. \\n[23] \\nCst. White testified that it was his impression that the male was trying to avoid making \\ncontact with him.  However, in cross-examination, Cst. White agreed that he saw no traffic \\nviolations, no burned-out lights on the vehicle, no concerning driving and had no indication that \\nthe driver was doing anything illegal or concerning.  He agreed, in cross-examination, that all \\nof the things he’d seen Mr. Morrison do – pumping and paying for gas, driving around the \\nparking lot and going into and coming out of the On Route building – were all innocuous things \\nthat Cst. White would expect someone at a gas and rest station to do.  \\n[24] \\nIn cross-examination, Cst. White also agreed that he had written in his notes that the driver \\nof the vehicle was engaging in “strange behaviour.”  He testified that this was because he had \\nobserved, after the gas was paid for, the vehicle being driven to the back of the parking lot \\nbefore returning to the front of the main On Route building.  However, he was confronted with \\nthe fact that the note about strange behaviour was made in his notebook before that driving had \\noccurred.  Cst. White had no explanation for this. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n[25] \\nCst. White was cross-examined about whether his attention was drawn to Mr. Morrison in \\nthe first place because he is Black and whether he had particular concerns about Mr. Morrison’s \\nbehaviour, which he characterized as “strange” because he is Black.  Cst. White denied the \\nsuggestion that Mr. Morrison being Black factored into the investigation. \\n[26] \\nAt 8:30 p.m., Cst. White asked, over the radio, for the communications centre to run the \\nregistered owner of the vehicle.  A person from the communications centre responded and \\nadvised that the male was wanted and had a flag that alerted officers to proceed with caution.  \\nBy that time, Cst. Kelly was at the On Route.  Cst. White then asked the communications centre \\nto broadcast the information he had just received over the air so that other officers would be \\naware of his location and what he was dealing with.  In cross-examination, Cst. White agreed \\nthat the communications centre staff member advised him that the one robbery conviction \\nshowing for the registered owner was from 2009, some 12 years before.   \\n[27] \\nAt approximately 8:30 p.m., Cst. White and Cst. Kelly approached the vehicle.  Cst. White \\nwas on the driver’s side and Cst. Kelly was on the passenger side.  They had each parked their \\npolice cars behind the vehicle, on an angle.  This meant that the rear of the vehicle was blocked \\nin by two police cars.  The front of the vehicle was parked against a cement curb. \\n[28] \\nCst. White approached the driver’s side window and asked Mr. Morrison, who was the \\ndriver, to lower his window.  Mr. Morrison complied by lowering his window partially.  Cst. \\nWhite asked Mr. Morrison whether he was the owner of the vehicle and Mr. Morrison replied \\nthat he was.  Cst. White concluded that the warrant was for Mr. Morrison and so he advised Mr. \\nMorrison that there was a warrant for his arrest out of Quebec.  He told Mr. Morrison to turn \\noff his vehicle and step out of it.  Cst. White told Mr. Morrison that he was under arrest on the \\nstrength of the warrant. \\n[29] \\nMr. Morrison told Cst. White that the warrant out of Quebec had been dealt with but that \\ndue to COVID there were still some issues with it.  Mr. Morrison did not get out of his vehicle.  \\nCst. White told him multiple times to get out of the vehicle but Mr. Morrison refused.  Cst. \\nWhite testified that he told Mr. Morrison that if he got out of his vehicle, Cst. White would \\ncheck into the warrant further and if what Mr. Morrison was saying was accurate, he would be \\nreleased unconditionally.  Mr. Morrison continued to refuse to get out of the vehicle.  Cst. White \\nattempted to open the door of the vehicle to physically remove Mr. Morrison but found that the \\ndoors were locked.  At some point in this exchange, Mr. Morrison raised the window and closed \\nit.  Cst. White noted that Mr. Morrison had a phone in one hand and a car key in the other.  It \\nlooked to Cst. White as though Mr. Morrison was making a phone call.  Cst. White testified \\nthat during this exchange, Mr. Morrison became belligerent with the officers and was swearing \\nat them. \\n[30] \\nAt some point, after the suggestion to do so was made over the air by another officer, a \\nspike belt was put on the ground in front of Mr. Morrison’s vehicle to prevent the vehicle from \\nbeing driven away. \\n[31] \\nCst. Clark, who is Black, arrived on scene and stationed himself in front of Mr. Morrison’s \\nvehicle.  Shortly after Cst. Clark arrived, Mr. Morrison complied with Cst. White’s instructions \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nand exited the vehicle.  He was immediately placed under arrest, at 8:40 p.m., on the outstanding \\n“tax warrant” and handcuffed.  At some point before or during the arrest, at least four other \\npolice officers arrived on scene.   \\n \\nAnalysis \\n[32] \\nI find that there is some evidence supporting the possibility that the fact that Mr. Morrison \\nis Black factored, to at least some extent, into the selection of him as a suspect by Cst. White.  \\nIn other words, there is some evidence supporting the possibility that Cst. White decided to run \\nMr. Morrison’s license plate because he is Black.  However, many of the indicators of racial \\nprofiling that are commonly seen in cases of racial profiling are not present in this case.  After \\na careful review of all of the evidence, I do not find that the evidence rises to the level of proving \\nthat it is likely or probable that Cst. White either consciously or subconsciously engaged in \\nracial profiling when he decided to run Mr. Morrison’s plate.  That is what Mr. Morrison would \\nhave to establish to be successful in this argument and I find that he has not done so. \\n[33] \\nThe evidence that supports the possibility that racial profiling occurred is as follows: \\n \\n1. Mr. Morrison’s license plate was the first and only plate that Cst. White \\nran upon arriving at the On Route.  Cst. White testified that he did not \\nrecall other cars being at the gas pump or other cars being in the parking \\nlot.  Mr. Morrison was out of his car, pumping gas, at the time that Cst. \\nWhite decided to run his plate and so would have been visible to Cst. \\nWhite who would have seen that Mr. Morrison is Black.  I noted, and \\nfound it odd, that in his examination-in-chief, Cst. White said, three \\ntimes, that “a vehicle was getting gas.”  Of course, a vehicle doesn’t get \\ngas.  A person puts gas into a vehicle.  Cst. White seemed to me to be \\nbeing very careful in his examination-in-chief to avoid describing the \\nperson he witnessed putting gas into the car.  I found his continued \\nreference to the vehicle seemingly getting itself gas as a sign of this \\navoidance.  In fact, the fact that Mr. Morrison is Black was not \\nreferenced for the first time until Cst. White was cross-examined. \\nThis is consistent with “street check” practices that are considered to be \\nan example of the manifestation of racial profiling in that it is an \\nexample of the police engaging in “heightened surveillance of \\nracialized individuals…using general investigative powers” such as a \\nlicense plate check.10 \\n                                                 \\n \\n10 Applying the Racial Profiling Correspondence Test, David M.

White decided that he was going to arrest Mr. Morrison on the \\nstrength of what he understood was a “tax warrant” out of the province \\nof Quebec, without first determining what exactly the warrant was for, \\nincluding whether it was a Criminal Code warrant which might \\nauthorize his exercise of Criminal Code arrest powers, whether he as \\nan officer in Ontario was authorized to act on the warrant and whether \\nQuebec police were willing to attend in Ontario to continue the arrest \\nand transport Mr. Morrison to Quebec. \\nCst. White called Cst. Kelly for back up once he decided he was going \\nto investigate whether the driver of the vehicle was the registered owner \\nand, if he was, arrest him.  This, despite the fact that the driver of the \\nvehicle had done nothing suspicious, illegal or concerning and Cst. \\nWhite had no concerns about the condition of the vehicle itself.  \\nCst. White repeatedly referred to there being “multiple” or “several” \\nflags relating to Mr. Morrison.  However, in his evidence, he indicated \\nthat at the time he decided to arrest the driver, assuming the driver was \\nthe registered owner, he knew that the registered owner had a tax warrant \\nout for him in Quebec, and was flagged as potentially armed and \\ndangerous due to a robbery conviction from 2009.  In my view, that is \\none flag – that a person is potentially armed and dangerous.    \\nCst. White and Cst. Kelly used their police vehicles to block Mr. \\nMorrison’s car in and placed a spike belt in front of his car.  Cst. White \\nalso asked the communications centre to broadcast the fact that he was \\ndoing a traffic stop over the air so that his colleagues were aware of what \\nhe was “dealing with.”  This, for an arrest on a “tax warrant” out of \\nQuebec. \\nThis is consistent with “over-reaction” by police as a manifestation of \\nracial profiling through intensifying the investigation, for example with \\nunjustifiable arrest, searches or excessive force, or responding to \\nperceived danger with extreme force.11 \\n3. Cst. White described Mr. Morrison’s behaviour as “strange” in his notes \\nand avoidant in his evidence in examination-in-chief despite the fact \\nthat Mr. Morrison’s behaviour was completely innocuous and \\nconsistent with what is expected from motorists stopping at a rest stop \\non the highway. \\n                                                 \\n \\n11 Applying the Racial Profiling Correspondence Test, supra, page 368; R. v. Sitladeen supra. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nThis is consistent with what Professor Tanovich labels the “spidey \\nsense” manifestation of racial profiling with the police interpreting \\nambiguous behaviour as incriminatory.  Such ambiguous behaviour has \\nbeen found to include the suspect looking away, walking away from \\npolice or failing to make eye contact.12 \\n[34] \\nOn the other hand, there are certain hallmarks of racial profiling that are not present in the \\nevidence.  For example, it does not appear that Mr. Morrison was investigated because of the \\ntype of car he was driving and Cst. White did not ask him questions such as what he was doing \\nat that location at that time or whether he was subject to bail conditions.  Cst. White simply \\nasked the question that was appropriate at that juncture in his investigation – whether Mr. \\nMorrison was the registered owner of the vehicle. \\n[35] \\nI also have to consider the fact that Cst. White’s unchallenged evidence is that he went to \\nthe On Route, as he had done many times before, because it was a slow night and so he intended \\nto run license plates.  Cst. Kelly’s evidence supported the notion that this is a common practice \\nfor OPP officers in this area.  Cst. White said he did not remember any other cars being at the \\ngas pumps and he did not think there were a lot of cars in the parking lot.  Without any other \\ncontextual evidence, it is impossible for me to determine whether Mr. Morrison was singled out \\nbecause he was the only Black person in the area or whether Cst. White simply chose to \\ninvestigate the license plate of the first vehicle he saw. \\n[36] \\nOnce Cst. White had information that there was an outstanding warrant for the registered \\nowner of the vehicle, it makes sense that he continued with the investigation.  In other words, \\nit is not consistent with an instance of racial profiling in which the officer spots a Black person \\nand then concocts a reason to interact with that person.  In this case, the information about the \\nwarrant gave Cst. White a valid reason to remain interested in Mr. Morrison’s vehicle and in \\nhim as the driver and to continue his investigation. \\n[37] \\nFurther, with respect to Cst. White calling for back up from Cst. Kelly and, ultimately, \\nother officers, on what he understood was an arrest on a “tax warrant,” I feel it is important to \\nnote that while I found there was a sense of overkill to Cst. White’s evidence about Mr. \\nMorrison having multiple or several flags on CPIC about violence, dangerousness, and/or \\nweapons, and initially referring to there being a flag about “robberies” plural when there was \\nonly one robbery conviction in CPIC, the fact is that Cst. White had at least some information \\nthat the registered owner of the vehicle he was looking at had been known at least in the past to \\nengage in violent criminal behaviour while armed.  Cst. White was in a highly public place and \\nhad a duty to approach the situation with caution for his own safety and that of members of the \\npublic.  I cannot say therefore that Cst. White called for back-up in this situation because Mr. \\nMorrison is Black and Cst. White, engaging in racial profiling, wrongly presumed Mr. Morrison \\nto be inherently more dangerous because he is Black.  He was not asked whether he calls for \\n                                                 \\n \\n12 Applying the Racial Profiling Correspondence Test, supra, page 366; R. v. Gala-Nyam, 2023 ONSC 2241. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nback up routinely when a registered owner is flagged the way Mr. Morrison was so I don’t know \\nwhether he departed from his normal practice in this situation, when dealing with Mr. Morrison. \\n[38] \\nWith respect to the use of the spike belt, Cst. Kelly testified that he was the one who laid \\nthe spike belt down after hearing that suggestion made over the police radio.  He considered it \\nand decided it was a good idea because Mr. Morrison was not getting out of the car as Cst. \\nWhite was asking him to and they were at a rest stop on the side of a busy highway.  Cst. Kelly \\nwanted to avoid any possibility that Mr. Morrison would take off onto the highway prompting \\na dangerous high-speed chase.  Again, I don’t have any evidence about whether Cst. Kelly has \\nmade or would make a similar decision anytime a person was behaving the way Mr. Morrison \\nwas.  Further, the issue isn’t really what was in Cst. Kelly’s mind when he laid the spike belt \\ndown.   \\n[39] \\nThe issue is whether Cst. White’s attention was drawn to Mr. Morrison in the first place \\nbecause of a conscious or subconscious belief that Mr. Morrison was more likely to be engaging \\nin criminal behaviour simply because he is Black.  In other words, the resolution of the racial \\nprofiling allegation, in my view, turns on whether I find that it is likely or probable that Cst. \\nWhite engaged in racial profiling when he selected Mr. Morrison as a possible suspect.  \\nAlthough I have some concerns that racial profiling may have played a role in Cst. White \\nchoosing to run Mr. Morrison’s license plate, I cannot say, based on the evidentiary record \\nbefore me, that it is likely or probable.  Mr. Morrison has therefore not met his burden of proof \\non this issue. \\n \\nS. 9 breach allegation \\n[40] \\nS. 9 of the Charter provides that everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or \\nimprisoned. \\n[41] \\nMr. Morrison argued that Cst. White did not have the authority to arrest him because: \\n1. Cst. White believed he was arresting Mr. Morrison on an outstanding \\n“tax warrant”; \\n2. Cst. White did not take sufficient steps to determine whether he had \\nthe authority to act on an out of province warrant before he arrested \\nMr. Morrison; and \\n3. Cst. White did not take sufficient steps to establish that Mr. Morrison \\nwas the person to whom the warrant related. \\n[42] \\nThe Crown argued that Cst. White was acting under the authority provided to him by s. \\n514(2) of the Criminal Code in executing the warrant and that the warrant he was actually \\nexecuting was a warrant for a breach of s. 145 of the Criminal Code. \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\nAdditional evidence relating to the arrest \\n[43] \\nCst. White testified that after he arrested Mr. Morrison on the outstanding warrant at 8:40 \\np.m., handcuffed him and took him to the police cruiser, he conducted a frisk search of Mr. \\nMorrison.  He then placed him in the back seat of the cruiser and read him his rights to counsel \\nand cautions. \\n[44] \\nAt 8:44 p.m. Cst. White made a notebook entry about “contacting a Quebec agency.” \\n[45] \\nAt 8:55 p.m., Cst. White told Mr. Morrison that he was under arrest for obstructing a police \\nofficer as a result of Mr. Morrison’s earlier refusal to get out of the car and his subsequent \\nlocking of the keys inside the vehicle and he read him his rights to counsel and cautions again.   \\n[46] \\nCst. White testified that he learned at 8:57 p.m., after arresting Mr. Morrison on the obstruct \\ncharge, that the warrant he initially arrested Mr. Morrison on was not endorsed as enforceable \\nin Ontario and police from Quebec would not be attending to arrest Mr. Morrison on the \\nwarrant.  Cst. White learned that Quebec police asked that he simply obtain Mr. Morrison’s \\ncontact information so that they could contact Mr. Morrison about the outstanding warrant and \\nasked that Cst. White send Mr. Morrison on his way.  Cst. White learned this after posing the \\nquestion to the communications centre.  He agreed that he could have asked this question of the \\ncommunications centre in the 22 minutes that elapsed between him running Mr. Morrison’s \\nlicense plate and learning about the outstanding warrant and then approaching Mr. Morrison’s \\nvehicle.   \\n[47] \\nIt was suggested to Cst. White in cross-examination that he had in fact learned prior to \\narresting Mr. Morrison on the obstruct charge that the warrant he initially arrested Mr. Morrison \\non was not enforceable in Ontario and that this knowledge was the reason for the arrest of Mr. \\nMorrison on the obstruct at 8:55 p.m., 15 minutes after Cst. White had all the information \\nnecessary to form the grounds for the arrest on the obstruct.  In other words, it was suggested \\nto Cst. White that he arrested Mr. Morrison on the obstruct as a result of learning that the initial \\narrest was not going to “stick.”  Cst. White denied this and maintained that he did not learn that \\nthe Quebec warrant was not endorsed for execution by an Ontario officer until after he had \\narrested Mr. Morrison on the obstruct charge. \\nAnalysis \\n[48] \\nI find that Cst. White breached Mr. Morrison’s s. 9 right not to be arbitrarily detained \\nbecause he exercised his power to arrest Mr. Morrison on the outstanding warrant before he had \\nsufficient information about the warrant to provide him with the necessary grounds to arrest on \\nit.  \\n[49] \\nThe Crown argued that s. 514(2) of the Criminal Code gave Cst. White the authority to \\narrest Mr. Morrison.   \\n[50] \\nS. 511 and s. 513 make it clear that a warrant is issued in and directed to the peace officers \\nwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the justice, judge or court that issued it.  In this case, the \\nviva voce evidence about the warrant that was tendered through Cst. White was that this warrant \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nwas out of the territorial jurisdiction of Quebec.  It would therefore have been directed to the \\npeace officers in the province of Quebec. \\n[51] \\nS. 514(1) provides that a warrant may be executed by arresting the accused wherever he is \\nfound within the territorial jurisdiction from which the warrant was issued, or wherever he is \\nfound in Canada, if he is being freshly pursued.  Neither of those scenarios apply in this case.  \\nMr. Morrison was not in Quebec, nor was he being freshly pursued. \\n[52] \\nS. 514(2) provides that an officer from the territorial jurisdiction that issued the warrant \\nmay execute the warrant in another territory.  In other words, a Quebec police officer would \\nhave been able to execute the warrant outstanding for Mr. Morrison in Ontario, assuming it was \\na warrant issued under the Criminal Code. \\n[53] \\nS. 703 provides for what are commonly called Canada-wide warrants which allow for \\nwarrants issued out of superior courts and appeal courts to be executed anywhere in Canada. \\n[54] \\nThe warrant that Cst. White arrested Mr. Morrison on was not tendered as an exhibit in this \\ncase so I do not know what it was for, whether it was a Criminal Code warrant, what section of \\nthe Criminal Code it was issued under and which court issued it.  What I do know is that there \\nis no evidence before me that it was a Canada-wide warrant pursuant to s. 703.  Further, there \\nis evidence before me that it was a warrant confined to the territorial jurisdiction of Quebec.   \\n[55] \\nThere is no evidence before me and no legal authority for the proposition that Cst. White \\nhad the authority to arrest Mr. Morrison on the outstanding warrant based on the information \\nhe had about the warrant at the time he arrested Mr. Morrison.  At that time, all he knew was \\nthat it was a “tax warrant” and that it was “out of Quebec.”  He did not even know if it was \\nalleged that Mr. Morrison had committed a criminal offence and was therefore wanted on a \\nCriminal Code warrant, let alone whether that offence was an indictable offence or whether the \\nwarrant was endorsed to allow an out of province arrest.   \\n[56] \\nThe Crown argued that reasonable and probable grounds should be attributed to Cst. White \\nfor an arrest on another apparently outstanding warrant for a breach of s. 145 of the Criminal \\nCode.  First, the evidence relating to this other apparently outstanding warrant, as referred to \\nby one other officer in his evidence, is far from clear.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, \\nCst. White’s evidence was clear.  He stated, numerous times, that his first arrest of Mr. Morrison \\nwas as a result of one outstanding warrant, out of Quebec and that that one warrant had \\nsomething to do with taxes in his mind.  It is Cst. White’s evidence as the arresting officer as \\nto the basis for the arrest that is important to the analysis, not what other officers thought that \\nMr. Morrison could have been arrested for. \\n[57] \\nCst. White should have taken additional steps to satisfy himself as to exactly what criminal \\ncharges, if any, the warrant was for that he was arresting Mr. Morrison on, whether he was \\nauthorized, as an Ontario police officer to arrest on the warrant, and on what basis, whether \\nQuebec police would return Mr. Morrison if Cst. White did have the authority to arrest him and \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\nwhether the warrant was in fact still in effect.13  Cst. White did none of these things.  He \\nproceeded with an arrest of an individual who was doing nothing illegal or concerning based \\non a woefully insufficient knowledge of what he was doing and why.  In my view, this is a clear \\nbreach of Mr. Morrison’s s. 9 Charter rights. \\n \\nS. 8 breach allegation \\n[58] \\nS. 8 of the Charter provides that everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable \\nsearch or seizure. \\n[59] \\nMr. Morrison argued that Cst. White breached his s. 8 rights when he conducted a pat down \\nor frisk search of Mr. Morrison after placing him under arrest and handcuffing him.  Mr. \\nMorrison argued that this was a breach because the provisions of the Quebec penal code applied \\nto this arrest because Cst. White Googled the French terms he saw on his computer screen and \\nbelieved that it was an outstanding tax warrant from Quebec and that he was required to bring \\nMr. Morrison before a judge.  Mr. Morrison argues that these facts put his situation within the \\nparameters of the findings of the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Martinbeault14 that the \\nQuebec Penal Code requires that the police use arrest procedures involving minimal detention.  \\nThis means that according to the Quebec Penal Code, a pat down search is a warrantless search \\nand unconstitutional when a warrant is being executed on an administrative matter such as a \\nnon-payment of fines.  Mr. Morrison argued that is what Cst. White, on his own evidence, was \\ndoing in this case and so R. v. Martinbeault applies.  \\n[60] \\nFurther, Mr. Morrison relied on R. v. Buakasa15 to argue that, even if I do not accept that \\nthe Quebec Penal Code applied to the arrest of Mr. Morrison, when the police have no concerns \\nabout officer safety or the accused fleeing the scene, a frisk search such as the one done in this \\ncase is a breach of Mr. Morrison’s s. 8 Charter rights.  Mr. Morrison argued the evidence \\nshowed the police had no such concerns in this case. \\n[61] \\nMore significantly, Mr. Morrison argues that Cst. Kelly breached his s. 8 Charter rights \\nwhen he searched Mr. Morrison’s vehicle because the search was not incident to a lawful arrest \\nnor did the police have any other legal authority to conduct it. \\n[62] \\nThe Crown argued that it is “trite law” that officers can do a pat down search in this \\nsituation and relied on R. v. Mann16 as authority for that proposition. \\n[63] \\nThe Crown argued that Cst. Kelly’s search of the vehicle was authorized for three reasons: \\n                                                 \\n \\n13 R. v. Marges, 2012 YKTC 102; R. v. Charles, 2012 SKCA 34; R. v. Gray, 2019 ONCJ 782. \\n14 R. v. Martinbeault, 2022 QCCA 902. \\n15 R. v. Buakasa, 2023 ONCA 383. \\n16 R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\n1. because of a second warrant that he believed was outstanding \\nfor Mr. Morrison for a breach of s. 145 of the Code; \\n2. as a result of Mr. Morrison’s obstruction of Cst. White that Cst. \\nKelly had just witnessed; and \\n3. for officer safety reasons. \\n \\nAdditional evidence relating to the searches \\n[64] \\nDuring the frisk search, Cst. White found a marijuana grinder in one of Mr. Morrison’s \\npockets.  He also located some marijuana residue but could not recall whether the residue was \\nin the grinder or in Mr. Morrison’s pocket.  Cst. White also located $1460 in cash in Mr. \\nMorrison’s pocket.  Cst. White testified that he searched Mr. Morrison to ensure that he did not \\nhave anything on him that could harm him or Cst. White and also to determine whether he was \\ncarrying anything illegal. \\n[65] \\nCst. White testified that he called a towing company to come and deal with Mr. Morrison’s \\ncar because the doors were locked and the keys were in the vehicle.  Cst. White intended for \\nthe vehicle to be searched incident to Mr. Morrison’s arrest on the obstruct charge combined \\nwith the fact that he had found marijuana residue either in Mr. Morrison’s pocket or in a grinder \\nin his pocket. \\n[66] \\nCst. White agreed, in cross-examination, that Mr. Morrison’s arrest on the obstruct was \\nbecause of his behaviour in refusing to leave the vehicle and that there was nothing that had \\nhappened that led Cst. White to believe that there was anything inside the vehicle that police \\nneeded to go and look for in relation to that offence.  Cst. White agreed that the search of the \\nvehicle had nothing to do with and was not incident to Cst. White’s original arrest of Mr. \\nMorrison on the outstanding warrant. \\n[67] \\nCst. White also agreed, in cross-examination, that Mr. Morrison was handcuffed and \\nsecured in the back seat of his car when the towing company was contacted.  There was no \\nurgency with respect to Mr. Morrison or his vehicle.  Cst. White said that the towing company \\nwas called to get into the vehicle without a key because the key was locked inside the vehicle. \\n[68] \\nCst. Kelly is the officer who conducted the search of Mr. Morrison’s vehicle.  Cst. Kelly \\ntestified that he believed that the warrant that Mr. Morrison was wanted on was a Quebec \\nwarrant for a charge under s. 145 of the Criminal Code which Cst. Kelly described as “a \\nbreach.” \\n[69] \\nCst. Kelly observed as he stood on the passenger side of Mr. Morrison’s vehicle, Mr. \\nMorrison inside the vehicle as Cst. White, who was on the driver’s side, repeatedly told Mr. \\nMorrison that he was under arrest and needed to step out of the vehicle.  Cst. Kelly said that \\nCst. Clark eventually arrived and went to where Cst. White was. Cst. Clark repeated Cst. \\nWhite’s demands that Mr. Morrison exit the vehicle. Cst. Kelly did not see Mr. Morrison reach \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nfor anything while Mr. Morrison was in the vehicle. Cst. Kelly saw nothing that led him to have \\nany concerns about weapons.  \\n[70] \\nCst. Kelly said that Mr. Morrison got out of the car at 8:40 p.m. and that he assisted Cst. \\nWhite in cuffing Mr. Morrison and escorting Mr. Morrison to Cst. White’s vehicle.  Cst. Kelly \\nobserved Cst. White do the frisk search of Mr. Morrison and then went back to Mr. Morrison’s \\nvehicle to conduct a search of the vehicle.  He said he intended to search the vehicle incident to \\nthe arrest Cst. White had just effected. \\n[71] \\nThe doors to the vehicle were locked and the key fob was visible on the floor in front of \\nthe driver’s seat.  The towing company came and opened the door.  At 9:13 p.m., Cst. Kelly \\nsearched the driver’s seat area and located a lighter and the key for the vehicle.  He then \\nsearched the back passenger seat and located, on the floor, the black leather satchel that \\ncontained the gun, ammunition and cocaine.  No wallet or identification was found inside the \\nsatchel.  Cst. Kelly said he searched this area because it was within reach of the driver’s seat. \\n[72] \\nCst. Kelly said that he could not recall who directed him to search the vehicle.  He testified \\nthat he “just always [does] that.”  He said that “it’s common law” that police search any area of \\nthe vehicle within reach of the driver incident to arrest and the only unusual thing about this \\nsituation was that the door was locked and so the towing company was required to come and \\nunlock the door. \\n[73] \\nCst. Kelly testified that he was searching the vehicle for evidence, weapons, any means of \\nescape and, for safe-keeping, any valuable items belonging to the driver.  He specified that \\nwhen a person is being taken into custody and their vehicle is being towed, their valuables are \\ntaken by police for safe-keeping, for liability purposes.  \\n[74] \\nCst. Kelly agreed in cross examination that he believed that Mr. Morrison was arrested on \\nthe strength of an outstanding “breach” warrant.  He did not know what Mr. Morrison was \\nalleged to have breached or how.  He agreed that he was searching Mr. Morrison’s vehicle for \\nevidence despite knowing nothing about the offence the warrant was outstanding for.  Cst. Kelly \\nagreed that the arrest had nothing to do with Mr. Morrison’s vehicle and nothing to do with \\nweapons.  He said that he was searching the driver’s seat and the area within reach of the driver \\nbased on his training.  He said that he searches the vehicle of any person arrested who has come \\nout of a vehicle.  He does this because his training and senior officers taught him to do that. \\n[75] \\nCst. Wangkhang assisted Cst. Kelly in his search of the vehicle.  She located an empty pill \\nbottle in the centre console of the vehicle with a name other than Mr. Morrison’s on the \\nprescription label.  She also located a men’s wallet in the centre console of the vehicle.  Cst. \\nWangkhang did not recall whether she looked in or pulled anything out of the wallet.  \\n[76] \\nCst. White later learned that his colleagues searched the vehicle and located a loaded gun \\nand cocaine.  At 9:17 p.m., Cst. White arrested Mr. Morrison on the gun and cocaine charges. \\nAnalysis \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\n[77] \\nI have found that Cst. White’s arrest of Mr. Morrison on what he believed was an \\noutstanding “tax warrant” out of Quebec was unlawful and breached Mr. Morrison’s s. 9 \\nCharter rights.  As the Crown conceded in argument, if Cst. White’s arrest of Mr. Morrison \\nwas not a lawful arrest, the obstruct charge fails because Cst. White was not in the lawful \\nexecution of his duty when arresting Mr. Morrison. \\n[78] \\nGiven that the arrests fail, the searches of Mr. Morrison and of his vehicle, incident to \\narrest, also fail because a lawful search cannot take place pursuant to an unlawful arrest. \\n[79] \\nHowever, in the event that I am wrong in my findings with respect to s. 9 of the Charter, I \\nwill consider whether the searches would be lawful if there had been a lawful arrest on the \\noutstanding warrant and whether there was any other basis upon which the police were entitled \\nto conduct the searches. \\n[80] \\nWith respect to the frisk search, in my view, it is clear that had Cst. White effected a lawful \\narrest, he would have had the authority to conduct a frisk search of Mr. Morrison before placing \\nhim in the rear of his police cruiser.  He would have had the authority to conduct such a frisk \\nsearch for officer safety reasons and as a search incident to arrest. I do not intend to engage in \\nany further analysis on this issue because the search of Mr. Morrison’s person did not ultimately \\nunearth any evidence of any importance. \\n[81] \\nThe lawfulness of the search of the vehicle is not so clear.  In order to withstand scrutiny \\nunder s. 8 of the Charter, a search must be authorized by law, the law itself must be reasonable, \\nand the search must be carried out in a reasonable manner.  A warrantless search, such as the \\none done of Mr. Morrison’s vehicle, is presumed to be unreasonable and the Crown has the \\nburden of showing that it was, on a balance of probabilities, reasonable.17 \\n[82] \\nA search incident to arrest must be conducted for a valid objective such as to search for \\nweapons or other things that may be a threat to the safety of the police, the accused or the public, \\nthat may facilitate escape or that may act as evidence against the accused. The search is only \\njustifiable if the purpose of the search is related to the purpose of the arrest.18 \\n[83] \\nAs the Supreme Court of Canada noted in R. v. Caslake at para. 19: \\n \\n…the three main purposes of search incident to arrest are ensuring the \\nsafety of the police and public, the protection of evidence from \\ndestruction at the hands of the arrestee or others, and the discovery of \\nevidence which can be used at the arrestee’s trial.  The restriction that \\nthe search must be “truly incidental” to the arrest means that the police \\nmust be attempting to achieve some valid purpose connected to the \\narrest.  Whether such an objective exists will depend on what the \\npolice were looking for and why.  There are both subjective and \\nobjective aspects to this issue.  …the police must have one of the \\n                                                 \\n \\n17 R. v. Caslake, [1998] 1 SCR 51, paras. 10-11. \\n18 R. v. Caslake, supra, paras. 14-17. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\npurposes for a valid search incident to arrest in mind when the search \\nis conducted.  Further the officer’s belief that this purpose will be \\nserved by the search must be a reasonable one. \\n[84] \\nIn this case, Cst. Kelly testified that he searched Mr. Morrison’s vehicle incident to his \\narrest on an outstanding warrant for a “breach.”  Cst. Kelly said that he was exercising a \\ncommon law power to search the car incident to arrest.  He also said that he searches a car \\nanytime someone comes out of it prior to being arrested.  He does this because that is, \\nessentially, just how it’s done, in his view.  This is not consistent with lawful exercise of a \\npolice power to search incident to arrest. \\n[85] \\nCst. Kelly said that he was searching the vehicle for evidence but he was not able to \\narticulate what evidence he was searching for.  Given that Mr. Morrison had been arrested on \\nan outstanding warrant, I fail to see what possible relevant evidence Cst. Kelly could have been \\nsearching for.  Even considering that he believed that the outstanding warrant was for a breach \\ncharge, given that he knew nothing about the breach allegations, again, there was no evidence \\nhe could have legitimately been searching for.19 \\n[86] \\nCst. Kelly said that he was searching the vehicle for weapons.  He had not seen any \\nweapons nor had he seen Mr. Morrison reach for anything during Mr. Morrison’s exchanges \\nwith Cst. White.  Unlike the situation in R. v. Buakasa20 , Cst. Kelly did not have any reason to \\nbe suspicious at the time of the search that Mr. Morrison had a weapon in the vehicle. Most \\nimportantly, Mr. Morrison was already secured in handcuffs in Cst. White’s cruiser having been \\npatted down by Cst. White before being placed there.  Searching for weapons or for a means of \\nescape in Mr. Morrison’s car after the point where he was in any position to access such \\nweapons or means of escape supports the conclusion that this was not a legitimate purpose of \\nthe search.21    \\n[87] \\nCst. Kelly also said that he could have searched the vehicle looking for Mr. Morrison’s \\nvaluables for safekeeping though his notes only indicated that he was searching for weapons \\nand evidence.  First, if the police were concerned with the safekeeping of Mr. Morrison’s \\nvaluables after arresting him on an outstanding warrant, perhaps the easiest way to deal with \\nthat, and any associated liability issues, would be to leave his belongings locked in his car the \\nway he had left them.  Secondly, I don’t accept that this was an inventory search for Mr. \\nMorrison’s valuables given that the men’s wallet that was found by Cst. Wangkhang wasn’t \\neven checked to see whether it was Mr. Morrison’s or not.  There is no evidence about whether \\nit had money or other valuables in it or whether it was seized.  There is also no evidence that \\nanything was done with Mr. Morrison’s vehicle after the towing company was called to open \\nit.  In other words, there is no evidence that it was towed as the vehicle in R. v. Buakasa was. \\n[88] \\nOverall, in my view, the most glaring problem with the search of Mr. Morrison’s vehicle \\nis that Cst. Kelly simply didn’t know what his authority was for doing the search and the specific \\n                                                 \\n \\n19 R. v. Santana, [2020] O.J. No. 2561 (C.A.), para. 28. \\n20 R. v. Buakasa, 2023 ONCA 383. \\n21 R. v. Santana, supra, para. 31. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\npurpose for searching this particular vehicle at that location at that time.  It was clear from Cst. \\nKelly’s evidence that he doesn’t fully understand what the common law authority that allows \\nhim to search a vehicle incident to arrest involves and what limitations there are on that power.  \\nCst. Kelly was clearly of the view that it allows the search of the driver’s seat of any vehicle \\nthat a detained person departs from, and the area within reach of that seat, in any case, regardless \\nof the circumstances and for any purpose.  That is not the law. \\n[89] \\nI find that Cst. Kelly’s evidence does not establish, on a balance of probabilities that the \\nsearch of Mr. Morrison’s vehicle was lawful, even if the arrest was lawful. \\n \\nS. 24(2) analysis \\n[90] \\nS. 24(2) of the Charter provides that where a court concludes that evidence was obtained \\nin a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by the Charter, the \\nevidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the \\nadmission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. \\n[91] \\nMr. Morrison argued that the evidence of the gun and cocaine located by the police during \\ntheir search of his vehicle should be excluded because the police breached his s. 8 and s. 9 \\nCharter rights by racially profiling him, arbitrarily arresting him and conducting an unlawful \\nsearch.  He argues that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into \\ndisrepute. \\n[92] \\nThe Crown argued that, if Charter breaches are found, which she submitted should not be \\nthe case, the evidence should not be excluded because the police acted in good faith, the \\nbreaches were minor, Mr. Morrison had a lowered expectation of privacy in his car and the \\nCrown’s case on serious charges would be gutted without this reliable evidence.  The Crown \\nargued that the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute by the admission \\nof the evidence. \\n[93] \\nThe evidence in question, the gun and the cocaine, were clearly obtained as a direct result \\nof the arrest of Mr. Morrison, which I found was in breach of s. 9 of the Charter and the \\nsubsequent search of his vehicle which I found was in breach of s. 8 of the Charter.  It is clear \\nthat the evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed Mr. Morrison’s Charter rights. \\n[94] \\nIn R. v. Grant22, the Supreme Court of Canada provided the following framework for a \\ncourt to consider when assessing and balancing the effect of admitting the impugned evidence \\non society’s confidence in the justice system.  The court shall consider: \\n1. the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct; \\n                                                 \\n \\n22 R. v. Grant, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\n2. the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused; and \\n3. society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. \\n[95] \\nI must not look at the Charter breaches in isolation.  Rather, I must look to the overall \\nconduct of the police investigation and the impact of any Charter breach on the investigation \\nas a whole.23 \\n \\nThe Seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct \\n[96] \\nI find that the police conduct in this case in breaching Mr. Morrison’s right not to be \\narbitrarily detained and his right not to be subject to unlawful search is conduct that the Court \\nshould distance itself from. \\n[97] \\nI want to be clear that I am not prepared to make a finding that the police intentionally set \\nout to breach Mr. Morrison’s Charter rights.  However, I find that the lack of appropriate steps \\ntaken by Cst. White before arresting Mr. Morrison and the lack of knowledge on both his and \\nCst. Kelly’s part about their authority to search incident to arrest take this case to the serious \\nend of the spectrum. \\n[98] \\nCst. White did not know what the warrant he arrested Mr. Morrison on was for.  He did not \\neven know if it was a warrant for a criminal offence.  He simply acted as though it was.  That, \\nin my view, is police conduct that cannot be condoned.  What Cst. White did know is that the \\nwarrant was out of the province of Quebec.  It was incumbent on Cst. White, before he interfered \\nwith Mr. Morrison’s liberty, to know exactly what the warrant was for and whether he had the \\nauthority as an officer outside the territorial jurisdiction for the warrant to arrest on the warrant.   \\n[99] \\nCst. White and Cst. Kelly were both incorrect in their assumptions that simply because Mr. \\nMorrison exited from a vehicle before being arrested, police automatically had the authority to \\nbreak into and then search his vehicle.  That, in my view, is also police conduct that cannot be \\ncondoned.  Cst. Kelly stated that he searched the vehicle because he was trained to do so and \\nsenior officers had told him to do so as part of his practice.  Police practices must be based on \\nthe lawful exercise of their powers and an individual officer is responsible and indeed expected \\nto know the law and to think about its proper application in each investigation he or she is \\ninvolved in.   \\n[100] I further note that Cst. Wangkhang seemed to display a similar lack of concern for the \\nreason for the search.  She was asked, in cross-examination, who directed her to participate in \\nthe search.  She said that no other officer instructed her.  She, according to her, “jumped in.”  \\nCst. Wangkhang was not present for the arrest of Mr. Morrison.  There is no evidence that she \\nreceived any information about the reason for the search of the vehicle from any other officer \\non scene.  I am not suggesting that, strictly speaking, Cst. Wangkhang needed to have her own \\n                                                 \\n \\n23 R. v. Santana, supra, para. 46. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\ngrounds to search the vehicle in order to assist with the search.  But I do find that her willingness \\nto simply start searching someone’s vehicle simply because another officer was already doing \\nso demonstrates a pattern of indifference or a lack of concern about whether Mr. Morrison’s \\nCharter rights were being respected.    \\n[101] Police are given wide powers within which to exercise their law enforcement duties.  They \\nneed to know the lawful basis for what they are doing whenever they interfere with the liberty \\nof a member of the public and they need to be able to clearly articulate and defend the basis for \\ntheir decisions later. \\n[102] I find that what I see as a cumulative effect of both breaches together gives an overall \\npicture of a lack of understanding of and respect for Mr. Morrison’s Charter rights that puts the \\npolice conduct more towards the serious end of the spectrum. This favours exclusion of the \\nevidence. \\n \\nThe impact of the breaches on Mr. Morrison’s Charter-protected interests \\n[103] It is difficult to imagine a more impactful intrusion on one’s liberty interests than being \\narrested by the police.  Accordingly, I find the s. 9 breach had an obviously significant impact \\non Mr. Morrison’s Charter-protected interests. \\n[104] In R. v. Grant, the Supreme Court held that an “unreasonable search contrary to s. 8 of the \\nCharter may impact on the protected interests of privacy, and more broadly, human dignity.  \\nAn unreasonable search that intrudes on an area in which the individual reasonably enjoys a \\nhigh expectation of privacy, or that demeans his or her dignity, is more serious than one that \\ndoes not.” \\n[105] The breach of s. 8 involved a search of Mr. Morrison’s car.  There is a reduced expectation \\nof privacy in one’s vehicle as compared to, for example, one’s home or computer or cell phone.  \\nHowever, in this case, I find that the fact that the police took additional steps to break into Mr. \\nMorrison’s locked car to conduct the unlawful search made the intrusion into his protected \\ninterests more serious than, for example, merely doing a visual scan of the interior of the vehicle \\nto look at its contents or doing a search of areas of the interior of an unlocked car. \\n[106] The combined impact of the significant intrusion on Mr. Morrison’s liberty interests from \\nhis unlawful arrest with the less significant but still important intrusion on his privacy interests \\nfrom the unlawful search of his vehicle favour the exclusion of the evidence. \\n \\nSociety’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits \\n[107] Society’s interest in the adjudication of criminal cases involving guns and illegal drugs, is \\nundoubtedly high.  The dangers associated with guns and drugs are well publicized in both the \\nmedia and in the caselaw. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\n[108] I must consider the reliability of the evidence, its importance to the prosecution’s case and \\nthe seriousness of the offence at issue.24   \\n[109] The loaded handgun and the cocaine found in Mr. Morrison’s car are undeniably reliable \\nevidence.  The evidence is critical to the Crown’s case.  Without it, there is no case.  The \\noffences are undeniably serious. \\n[110] These factors weigh against the exclusion of the evidence. \\n \\nConclusion regarding Charter applications \\n[111] I must balance the three parts of the analysis to reach the goal which is not to punish the \\npolice for their errors but to “address systemic concerns involving the broad impact of admitting \\nthe evidence on the long-term repute of the justice system.”25 \\n[112] The first two lines of inquiry, regarding the seriousness of the state conduct and the impact \\non Mr. Morrison’s Charter-protected interests point strongly towards exclusion of the evidence \\nwhile the third line of inquiry points away from exclusion. \\n[113] In my view, to admit the evidence of the gun and the cocaine, in the face of such clear \\nbreaches by the police, on more than one front, of Mr. Morrison’s most fundamental Charter \\nrights would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  In the long term, or in the overall \\npicture, in order for the public to know that their justice system is functioning properly, they \\nmust know that the police are educated about the proper exercise of their authority and that the \\npolice will be able to clearly articulate the basis for their exercise of authority.  The public must \\nbe confident that serious cases will be prosecuted but it must be done on the basis of evidence \\nthat has been properly obtained.  Evidence gathered through such clear and combined misuses \\nof police power is not evidence upon which, the foundation for a meritorious prosecution can \\nbe built. \\n[114] On a balance of probabilities, I find that the evidence of the gun and cocaine found in the \\nsatchel in Mr. Morrison’s vehicle should be excluded. \\n \\nEvidence of possession on the trial proper \\n[115] In the event I am incorrect in my findings on the Charter applications, I will address the \\nremaining argument on the trial proper. \\n                                                 \\n \\n24 R. v.

Beaver, supra, at para. 133. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\n[116] Mr. Morrison argued that even if the evidence of the gun and cocaine found in the leather \\nsatchel in the rear passenger footwell of his vehicle is admissible, the Crown has not proven, \\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that he possessed those items because it has not proven that he had \\nknowledge and control over them. \\n[117] The Crown argued that Mr. Morrison’s knowledge of the gun and cocaine in the satchel is \\nproved through the following evidence: \\n1. A used marijuana grinder was found on Mr. Morrison during the \\nfrisk search as was some marijuana residue. A baggie of marijuana \\nwas found in the leather satchel with the gun and the cocaine.  The \\nCrown argued that this demonstrated a link between Mr. Morrison \\nand the contents of the leather satchel because there was marijuana \\non him and in the satchel.   \\n2. Mr. Morrison is the registered owner of the vehicle. \\n3. Mr. Morrison was the lone occupant of the vehicle on this occasion. \\n4. The satchel was located in the rear passenger seat footwell, in plain \\nview, within reach of the driver. \\n5. Mr. Morrison’s behaviour in obstructing the officers by not leaving \\nthe vehicle and by locking the doors with the keys inside. In other \\nwords, Mr. Morrison acted as though there was something to hide in \\nthe car, demonstrating knowledge and control over the gun and \\ndrugs, and the importance of keeping their whereabouts from the \\npolice. \\n \\nAnalysis \\n[118] The Crown’s case on the issue of Mr. Morrison’s knowledge and control of the gun and \\ncocaine is a circumstantial case.  In order to conclude that Mr. Morrison had knowledge and \\ncontrol of these items, I must conclude that it is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from \\nthe evidence.  I have to consider other possible theories that may be inconsistent with his having \\nknowledge or control of these items.  But these other possible theories must arise from the \\nevidence or lack of evidence.  The Crown need not negative every speculative suggestion.26 \\n[119] I do not find that the marijuana grinder and marijuana residue on Mr. Morrison provide \\nany link to knowledge and control over the items in the satchel in the back of the car.  Marijuana \\nis now legal in Canada and many people carry it and, in fact, use it in public.  I find it of no \\nmore assistance than I would if Mr. Morrison was found to have had cigarettes on his person \\n                                                 \\n \\n26 R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33 at para. 37. \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\nand there were cigarettes found in the satchel.  This is a generic piece of evidence.  There is no \\nevidence before me that the marijuana on Mr. Morrison was even the same type of marijuana \\nthat was found in the satchel. \\n[120] The fact that Mr. Morrison is the registered owner and was the lone occupant of the vehicle \\nis the strongest evidence pointing to him having knowledge of and control over the items in the \\nsatchel on the floor in the back seat.  However, that is not enough.  He may not have been the \\nonly person to use that vehicle.  Simply because one is the registered owner of a vehicle and \\nthe one currently using it does not mean that one knows, at any given moment, what another \\ndriver of the vehicle or any passenger of the vehicle has left in the vehicle at any point prior.  \\nThe driver and registered owner of the vehicle would have no idea what anyone else had put in \\nthe glove compartment, side door pockets, or under the seats unless he had seen the person put \\nit there or looked in the area and seen it there. \\n[121] It is not clear that the satchel was in plain view.  Cst. White and Cst. Kelly were both \\nstanding outside the vehicle, at the sides, looking in, for approximately nine minutes while Cst. \\nWhite attempted to get Mr. Morrison to leave the vehicle.  Neither one of them testified to \\nseeing a black leather satchel in the rear passenger footwell.  If neither one of them saw it from \\ntheir vantage point outside of the car, standing up, looking in, it cannot be assumed that Mr. \\nMorrison would have seen it from the driver’s seat of the vehicle. \\n[122] Mr. Morrison’s behaviour in refusing to exit the vehicle and in locking the keys in the car \\nmay have been in order to thwart the police in searching the car because he knew the gun and \\ncocaine was there.  However, there are other theories that are also consistent with the evidence.  \\nCst. White testified that Mr. Morrison attempted to tell him that the warrant was not valid and \\nthat he said this before refusing to get out of the car.  So, it is possible that Mr. Morrison was \\nrefusing to comply with what he believed was an unlawful arrest.  There is also no evidence as \\nto how the doors of Mr. Morrison’s vehicle came to be locked and how the key ended up on the \\nfloor of the driver’s seat.  There is no evidence that it was in fact Mr. Morrison who locked the \\ndoor or that he did so using the fob or that he did so intentionally.  Whomever locked the door \\nmay have done so by accident.  There were at least five officers on the scene by the time Cst. \\nWhite arrested Mr. Morrison and they were all there to lend assistance.  It is possible that one \\nof them closed the door to the car when the locks had already been activated.  While some of \\nthis may be speculation, the fact is that there is no evidence that it was Mr. Morrison who locked \\nthe car doors and/or left the key inside. \\n[123] Consistent with my obligation to consider other theories available on the circumstantial \\nevidence that has been presented, I must consider the fact that there was a prescription pill bottle \\nin the centre console of the vehicle with another person’s name on the prescription label which \\nwas from a pharmacy in Morrisburg.  This is possible evidence that someone else, namely the \\nperson named on the pill bottle, was a passenger in or driver of the vehicle at some prior time.   \\n[124] Further, Cst. Wangkhang located a male’s wallet in the centre console, where the pill bottle \\nwas but there is no evidence as to whether there was identification in the wallet and, if so, \\nwhose.  If it was Mr. Morrison’s wallet, with his identification in it, I would have to consider \\nthe significance of his wallet being in the console of the vehicle as opposed to in the satchel \\n2024 ONSC 1803 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\nwith items the Crown argued are in his possession.  If there was identification in the wallet \\nbelonging to someone else, that would be further evidence that another person may have driven \\nor been a passenger in the vehicle.  Because Cst. Wangkhang did not look at or did not note the \\ncontents of the wallet, there is no evidence on this point. \\n[125] At the end of the analysis, all that I can conclude is that Mr. Morrison is the registered \\nowner and was, at the time of the search, the lone occupant of the vehicle.  I do not find that the \\nevidence establishes that the satchel was in plain sight.  This evidence is not sufficient to prove, \\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Morrison was in possession of the gun and cocaine in the \\nleather satchel. \\nConclusion \\n[126] Mr. Morrison will be found not guilty on all counts. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nJustice L.

BOSWELL J. \\n[1] \\nMr. Di Luciano was arrested and charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle on \\nChristmas Day 2019.  On three occasions following his arrest, the police demanded that he provide a \\nsample of his breath for analysis.  Each time he refused.   \\n[2] \\nIn a pre-trial application, Mr. Di Luciano sought to exclude evidence of the breath demands and \\nhis refusals from evidence at his trial, alleging that a number of his Charter rights were infringed \\nduring the course of the police investigation. \\n[3] \\nI granted the application in part, for reasons reported as 2023 ONSC 6219.  Significantly, \\nhowever, I found that: \\n(a) \\nThe arresting officer, PC Shannon Swiderski, had reasonable grounds to arrest Mr. Di \\nLuciano for impaired operation.  In other words, I found that he was lawfully arrested; \\nand, \\n(b) \\nA demand for a sample of his breath made by a breath technician had been made lawfully.  \\nIt was not tainted by any prior Charter breach and was admissible in evidence against \\nhim.  \\n[4] \\nMr. Di Luciano’s trial proceeded before a jury in November, 2023.  As a result of certain \\ntestimony given by PC Swiderski at trial, defence counsel argues that I should re-open the Charter \\napplication and consider anew my findings that Mr. Di Luciano had been lawfully arrested and that the \\nbreath technician’s demand was lawfully made. To be more specific, counsel urges me to rethink the \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n2 \\n \\n \\narresting officer’s credibility, in light of her trial testimony, and conclude that she did not have honest, \\nsubjective grounds to believe that Mr. Di Luciano had operated a motor vehicle at a time when his \\nability to do so was impaired by alcohol.  Such a conclusion would undermine the lawfulness of the \\narrest and the breath technician’s demand for reasons I will explain momentarily. \\n[5] \\nFirst, a brief recap of the proceedings to date will aid in placing the arguments on this motion \\ninto context. \\nRECAP \\n[6] \\nMr. Di Luciano was travelling eastbound on Major MacKenzie Drive at about 10:45 p.m. on \\nChristmas Day 2019.  He was driving a Toyota Sequoia SUV. The applicable speed limit was 60 \\nkm/hr.  Mr. Di Luciano was driving up to 120 km/hr.  He ran a red light at the intersection of Major \\nMacKenzie and Fossil Hill Road and “T-boned” an SUV, with three occupants, waiting in the \\nintersection to make a left turn from Fossil Hill Road onto Major MacKenzie.  \\n[7] \\nThe collision ultimately gave rise to a number of charges.  By the time the case was ready for \\ntrial, Mr. Di Luciano faced nine counts: dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death, \\ndangerous operation causing bodily harm (x2), impaired operation causing death, impaired operation \\ncausing bodily harm (x2), refusal to provide a breath sample causing death, and refusal causing bodily \\nharm (x2). \\n[8] \\nMr. Di Luciano was arrested at the scene of the collision and initially charged with impaired \\noperation of a motor vehicle and driving with a blood alcohol concentration equal to or greater than 80 \\nmg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood.  I ruled that the Over 80 charge was unlawful because it was laid at \\na time when the arresting officer did not have any evidence about the concentration of alcohol in Mr. \\nDi Luciano’s blood.  \\n[9] \\nWhile still at the collision scene, PC Swiderski made a demand for a sample of Mr. Di \\nLuciano’s breath.  More specifically, she demanded that he provide a sample into an approved \\nscreening device (“ASD”).  He refused to do so.  I ruled that the demand was unlawful because PC \\nSwiderski did not actually have an ASD in her possession. I found that it was a breach of Mr. Di \\nLuciano’s s. 8 Charter right and excluded evidence of the first refusal under s. 24(2) of the Charter.  \\n[10] \\nMr. Di Luciano was conveyed to the police station.  He was booked in by Acting Staff Sergeant \\nCathy Armstrong. During the booking process, PC Swiderski made a second demand for a sample of \\nMr. Di Luciano’s breath.  He again refused.  I ruled that the second demand breached Mr. Di Luciano’s \\ns. 8 and 10(b) rights and I excluded evidence of his second refusal under s. 24(2).  \\n[11] \\nAfter being booked into the station, Mr. Di Luciano was provided with an opportunity to speak \\nto legal counsel.  While he was consulting with counsel, PC Swiderski advised the breath technician – \\nPC Wade Neathercott – of her grounds for arresting Mr. Di Luciano for impaired operation.  PC \\nNeathercott relied on those grounds to subsequently make a demand for a sample of Mr. Di Luciano’s \\nbreath after he was finished consulting with counsel. Mr. Di Luciano refused PC Neathercott’s demand. \\n[12] \\nAmongst other relief pursued on the Charter application, Mr. Di Luciano sought the exclusion \\nfrom evidence of his refusal to the breath technician’s demand.  I concluded, however, that it had not \\nbeen obtained in a manner that breached any of his Charter rights.  Moreover, I ruled that even if it had \\nbeen obtained unconstitutionally, I would not have excluded it under s. 24(2). \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n3 \\n \\n \\n[13] \\nAfter I released my ruling on the Charter motions, Mr. Di Luciano applied to sever the refusals \\ncounts from the dangerous operation and impaired operation counts.  I granted that application with the \\nrefusals counts to proceed as a judge alone trial immediately following the jury trial on the other \\ncounts. \\n[14] \\nThe trial of the dangerous operation and impaired operation counts proceeded before a jury \\nbetween November 15, 2023 and November 24, 2023.  The jury returned the following verdicts: \\n(a) \\nNot guilty of any of the impaired operation counts; \\n(b) \\nNot guilty of either dangerous operation causing bodily harm counts, but guilty of \\ndangerous operation simpliciter on both; and, \\n(c) \\nNot guilty of dangerous operation causing death, but guilty of dangerous operation \\ncausing bodily harm. \\n[15] \\nAt the request of Mr. Di Luciano’s counsel, and unopposed by the Crown, I stayed the two \\nconvictions for dangerous driving simpliciter on the basis that they were subsumed in the conviction \\nfor dangerous driving causing bodily harm.  In other words, all three convictions arose from the same \\ndelict. \\n[16] \\nSentencing was put over to March 4, 2024, along with the trial of the refusal counts.1  Prior to \\nthat date, defence counsel filed this motion to re-open the Charter application seeking exclusion of the \\nbreath technician’s demand and Mr. Di Luciano’s corresponding refusal.  The principal ground for the \\nmotion was set out as follows: \\nPC Swiderski gratuitously exaggerated her evidence at trial which detracts from \\nher credibility. The Applicant submits this is a material change in \\ncircumstances which requires this Court to reconsider the earlier finding that (a) \\nshe had honest and subjective grounds to arrest the Applicant for impaired \\noperation, and relatedly, (b) that since the Applicant was lawfully arrested and \\ndetained, the breath room refusal was not obtained in a manner that infringed \\nhis Charter-protected interests.  \\nTHE GOVERNING PRINCIPLES \\n[17] \\nThe principles that govern this motion are straightforward and well-settled. Interlocutory orders \\nrelating to the conduct of a trial may be varied or revoked in the event of a material change in \\ncircumstances.  If such a change occurs, either party may request that a previous evidentiary ruling be \\nre-visited. See R. v. Adams, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 707, at para. 30; R. v. La, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680, at para. 28; \\nR. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, at para. 74. \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 Subsequent to the jury’s verdict, and in light of certain findings made by the jury, the Crown elected to pare down the \\nrefusals counts to one count of refusal causing bodily harm.  It is unnecessary for the purposes of this ruling to elaborate on \\nthe basis for the Crown’s decision. \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n4 \\n \\n \\n[18] \\nThe burden of establishing a material change in circumstances falls on the party seeking to vary \\nthe earlier order. The moving party must establish that a change in circumstances has occurred and that \\nchange, had it been known at the time of the initial order, would likely have resulted in an order on \\ndifferent terms.  See Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Manitoba, 2021 SCC 33, at para. 55. \\n[19] \\nIn light of these simple principles, two questions must be answered to dispose of this motion:  \\n(i) \\nHas there been a change in circumstances? \\n(ii) \\nWould the changed circumstances likely have resulted in a different order?  \\n[20] \\nI will consider these questions in turn.  \\nANALYSIS \\n(i) \\nHas there been a change in circumstances? \\n[21] \\nAnswering this first question requires an examination of the changing testimony of the arresting \\nofficer between the voir dire and the trial. \\nThe Voir Dire Evidence \\n[22] \\nA preliminary hearing was waived in this proceeding.  PC Swiderski first testified about her \\narrest of Mr. Di Luciano during the Charter voir dire.   \\n[23] \\nShe testified in chief that she was on duty in a patrol car on Christmas night 2019.  She \\nresponded to a dispatch call at about 10:47 p.m. regarding a motor vehicle collision.  The information \\nshe got from dispatch was that a vehicle was “all over the road” and had caused an accident. There was \\na car on the median and someone was trapped in one of the involved vehicles. \\n[24] \\nPC Swiderski arrived on scene at about 10:51 p.m.  She saw that there was an SUV on the \\nmedian that had severe damage to the rear driver’s side.  Her first concern was for the occupants of that \\nvehicle.  \\n[25] \\nSoon after she arrived, EMS attended the scene.  PC Swiderski then turned her attention to the \\nsecond vehicle involved in the collision – a black SUV in the curb lane roughly 200 metres east.  She \\nwalked in its direction.  She observed two males walking away from the SUV and towards her.  One – \\nlater identified as Michael Bonello – was supporting the other – later identified as Mr. Di Luciano.    \\n[26] \\nAccording to PC Swiderski, Mr. Bonello told her that the person he was supporting was the \\ndriver.  She said she noticed that his footing was staggered.  When she approached him she noticed that \\nhis eyes were bloodshot and watery.  His reaction time seemed to her to be delayed.  When standing \\nstill he appeared to sway.  And he had “an odour of alcohol about him.” \\n[27] \\nShe said she formed the grounds to believe Mr. Di Luciano was impaired and she arrested him \\nfor impaired operation. \\n[28] \\nUnder cross-examination, PC Swiderski indicated that she understood the importance of \\ndocumenting the indicia of impairment that she observed.  She also said that the indicia that she \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n5 \\n \\n \\nobserved at the collision scene remained constant throughout her interactions with Mr. Di Luciano \\nduring the night.   \\n \\nThe Trial Evidence  \\n[29] \\nAt trial, PC Swiderski testified that as she approached the black SUV at the collision scene, she \\nnoticed Mr. Bonello assisting the driver of the vehicle.  The driver was “unsteady and kind of \\nstaggering”.  Mr. Bonello, she said, told her that he believed the driver was intoxicated by alcohol. \\n[30] \\n She said that as she approached Mr. Di Luciano, she noticed that his eyes were watery and red, \\nhe didn’t seem to be focused on anything, and he seemed somewhat dishevelled.  When he stood still, \\nhe was swaying from side to side and appeared to need support to stand still.  She asked him if he was \\ninjured and when he answered “no”, she could smell alcohol on his breath. \\n[31] \\nShe was asked by Crown counsel, “Could you describe…the strength or, or weakness, or \\nfaintness, of the odour of alcohol that you smelled?”   She answered, “It was a very strong smell.  Very.  \\nHe – for lack of a better word – he ‘reeked’ of alcohol.” \\n[32] \\nPC Swiderski’s demeanour while answering the Crown’s question is also of some significance.   \\nIn my recollection, as she answered the question, she turned towards the jury and emphasized the word \\n“reeked”. \\n[33] \\nUnder cross-examination, she doubled down on her testimony.  The following exchange took \\nplace, as she was questioned by Mr. Lacy: \\n \\nQ: \\n…You’ve described today that he reeked of alcohol, right? \\n \\nA: \\nYes. \\n \\nQ: \\nNot just a strong odour, reeked of it? \\n \\nA: \\nYes. \\n \\nQ: \\nIt was just omnipresent, it was so obvious that it reeked everywhere, correct? \\n \\nA: \\nYes.  I was in very close proximity to him and it was a very strong smell. \\n \\n… \\n \\nQ: \\n…it reeked, it would have been obvious to anyone who had any close interaction with \\nhim, that’s what you’ve said, right? \\n \\nA: \\nYes. \\n[34] \\nShe agreed that she had not used the word “reeked” in the contemporaneous notes she made of \\nher interactions with Mr. Di Luciano.  She said instead that there was “a strong smell of alcohol.”  She \\nacknowledged that her testimony at trial was the first time she described, on the record, Mr. Di Luciano \\n“reeking” of alcohol.  \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n6 \\n \\n \\n[35] \\nShe confirmed that the same indicia she observed at the site of the collision persisted until the \\nend of Mr. Di Luciano’s interaction with the breath technician, including the odour of alcohol and the \\nunsteadiness on his feet.  \\n \\nConclusion  \\n[36] \\nAs I expressed to counsel during the argument of the motion, I am satisfied that PC Swiderski’s \\nevidence changed from the voir dire to the trial.  \\n[37] \\nTo be fair, she was not asked directly, during the voir dire, to describe the potency of the odour \\nof alcohol she said she smelled on Mr. Di Luciano’s breath prior to arresting him. That said, she was \\ncertainly asked about the indicia of impairment that she observed, and she said only that she noticed an \\nodour of alcohol.  There was no mention of him “reeking” of alcohol. She also acknowledged the \\nimportance of documenting any observed indicia of impairment in her notebook.  Her notes reflect that \\nshe observed a “strong” odour of alcohol. Again, the term “reeked” does not appear. \\n[38] \\nThe use of the word “reeked” to describe the odour of alcohol on Mr. Di Luciano’s breath \\nappeared for the first time in PC Swiderski’s trial testimony. One might argue, I suppose, that to “reek” \\nof something is to smell strongly of it. In that sense, her use of the term “reeked” is arguably not \\ninconsistent with the contemporaneous notes she made of her observations.  \\n[39] \\nMy view, however, is that PC Swiderski’s use of the word “reeked” was meant to convey to the \\njury that she observed a very strong stench of alcohol. I say that in part because of the emphasis she put \\non the word “reeked” as she described the smell. I was left with the distinct impression that she was \\ngilding the lily in an effort to persuade the jury that Mr. Di Luciano was impaired.  \\n[40] \\nI am satisfied that her testimony regarding the potency of the odour of alcohol she observed on \\nMr. Di Luciano’s breath changed from the voir dire to the trial. \\n(ii) \\nWould the Changed Testimony Likely Have Made a Difference? \\n[41] \\nTo constitute a material change in circumstances, the new evidence offered by PC Swiderski at \\ntrial must be such that it is reasonable to think that it would likely have affected the outcome of the voir \\ndire. In other words, to trigger a reconsideration of my Charter ruling, Mr. Di Luciano must satisfy the \\ncourt that if PC Swiderski’s changed evidence had been known at the time of the voir dire, it would \\nlikely have resulted in a different conclusion about her reasonable grounds to arrest Mr. Di Luciano and \\nto demand a breath sample. \\n[42] \\nAssessing the materiality of the changed testimony requires a brief review of my findings from \\nthe Charter voir dire. \\nFindings from the Voir Dire \\n[43] \\nPC Swiderski’s credibility was a matter of controversy during the voir dire.  In submissions \\nmade at the conclusion of evidence, defence counsel urged the court to find that PC Swiderski was not \\na credible witness and to reject her testimony that she formed the subjective grounds that Mr. Di \\nLuciano’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n7 \\n \\n \\n[44] \\nThose grounds were of vital concern, of course, to the Crown’s case on the impaired operation \\ncharges and the refusal charges. \\n[45] \\nTo lawfully arrest Mr. Di Luciano for impaired operation, PC Swiderski was required to have \\nreasonable grounds to do so. Reasonable grounds is a standard that contains both subjective and \\nobjective elements. PC Swiderski must, therefore, have subjectively believed that Mr. Di Luciano had \\noperated a conveyance while his ability to do so was impaired to any degree by alcohol.  Her subjective \\ngrounds must have been objectively reasonable.  See R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 24. \\n[46] \\nSimilarly, to make a lawful demand for a breath sample into an approved instrument, a police \\nofficer must have reasonable grounds to believe that a person has operated a conveyance while the \\nperson’s ability to do so was impaired to any degree by alcohol. See s. 320.28 of the Criminal Code. \\nAgain, the reasonable grounds standard contains both subjective and objective elements. \\n[47] \\nIn the result, had I concluded that PC Swiderski did not have reasonable grounds to believe that \\nMr. Di Luciano had operated his vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol, a number \\nof conclusions would have followed, including: \\n(a) \\nHer arrest of Mr. Di Luciano for impaired operation would have been unlawful; \\n(b) \\nPC Neathercott’s demand for a sample of Mr. Di Luciano’s breath would have been \\nunlawfully made, given that it was entirely dependent on PC Swiderski’s grounds; and, \\n(c) \\nMr. Di Luciano’s refusal would have been evidence obtained in a manner that infringed \\nhis Charter-protected interests, as a result of its connection to both the unlawful arrest and \\nthe unlawful breath demand.  This conclusion would have triggered an analysis under s. \\n24(2) as to whether the refusal should be excluded from evidence.    \\n[48] \\nDefence counsel focused on a number of aspects of PC Swiderski’s testimony on the voir dire \\nin an effort to undermine her credibility, including, but not limited to: \\n(a) \\nShe was a fairly inexperienced officer who made a number of significant mistakes in her \\ninvestigation on the occasion in issue; \\n(b) \\nShe had minimal interaction with Mr. Di Luciano prior to arresting him.  Indeed, the \\ndefence position was that she walked right up to him and put the cuffs on him without \\nrealistically having had the time to make any assessment of his condition; \\n(c) \\nShe relied on a number of observations to purportedly form her subjective grounds that \\nwere at least equally consistent with the fact that Mr. Di Luciano had just been involved \\nin a serious motor vehicle collision; and, \\n(d) \\nShe said the indicia of impairment that she observed remained constant throughout the \\nnight, but the same observations were not made by other officers who interacted with Mr. \\nDi Luciano.  \\n[49] \\nI will take a moment to comment on the evidence of other officers who testified on the voir \\ndire.  \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n8 \\n \\n \\n[50] \\nThere were three other officers who interacted with Mr. Di Luciano shortly after his arrest and \\neach of them testified on the voir dire.  \\n[51] \\nPC Sahilpreet Deol was a relatively inexperienced officer who was doing front-desk duty when \\nMr. Di Luciano was brought into the station.  He conducted a pat-down search of Mr. Di Luciano in the \\nbooking area.  He testified that he noticed an odour of alcohol on Mr. Di Luciano’s breath.  Otherwise, \\nhe made no notes of any further indicia of impairment. \\n[52] \\nActing Staff Sergeant Cathy Armstrong was the senior officer in charge of the station and the \\none who booked Mr. Di Luciano into the station.  She testified that as she spoke to Mr. Di Luciano in \\nthe booking room, she observed that his eyes were red, that he was slurring a little and that he was \\nspeaking slowly.  She formed the opinion that he may have been consuming alcohol earlier in the \\nevening.  She otherwise made no note of any observation of balance issues or an odour of alcohol. \\n[53] \\nPC Wade Neathercott was an experienced officer who was the on-call breath technician that \\nnight. He made no notes about having observed any indicia of impairment.  He was in the breath tech \\nroom with Mr. Di Luciano for roughly twenty minutes. It is a relatively small room and they were \\nseated across a small desk from one another. He said that if he had observed any indicia of impairment, \\nhe would have made a note of them.  \\n[54] \\nThe evidence of the Officers Deol and Armstrong provided some, though not especially strong, \\ncorroboration of PC Swiderski’s subjective grounds. The evidence of Officer Neathercott was not \\ncorroborative. Notwithstanding the lack of strong support from other officers’ testimony, I found that \\nPC Swiderski had formed honest, subjective grounds that Mr. Di Luciano’s ability to operate a motor \\nvehicle was impaired by alcohol.   \\n[55] \\nI was satisfied that PC Swiderski’s evidence was sufficiently credible and reliable on the issue \\nof her subjective grounds, having regard to all of the surrounding circumstances, known to her at the \\ntime of Mr. Di Luciano’s arrest, which included:  \\n(a) \\nPC Swiderski had learned from dispatch that witnesses had reported that Mr. Di Luciano’s \\nvehicle was “all over the road” before the collision occurred; \\n(b) \\nThere had been a serious motor vehicle collision at a controlled intersection, which is \\ncircumstantial evidence consistent with impairment; \\n(c) \\nWhen she first observed Mr. Di Luciano, he was being assisted away from his vehicle \\nwith the help of another male, Michael Bonello, and appeared unsteady on his feet; \\n(d) \\nMr. Bonello formed the opinion that Mr. Di Luciano was impaired and he expressed that \\nopinion to PC Swiderski;   \\n(e) \\nPC Swidersk observed that Mr. Di Luciano’s eyes were red, he was slurring his words, \\nand he smelled of alcohol. These observations were, to some extent, corroborated by the \\ntestimony of S/Sgt. Armstrong and PC Deol; and, \\n(f) \\nMr. Bonello also testified that in his interactions with Mr. Di Luciano, he too observed \\nhim to slur his words, be unsteady on his feet, and to smell of alcohol. \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n9 \\n \\n \\n[56] \\nI appreciate that the foregoing circumstances are ones that may arguably support the objective \\nreasonableness of a subjective belief that Mr. Di Luciano operated his vehicle while impaired by \\nalcohol. Care must be taken not to conflate evidence going to the officer’s subjective belief with \\nevidence going to the objective reasonableness of that belief. That said, I accept that these enumerated \\nfactors were known to PC Swiderski at the time she purportedly formed her subjective grounds. They \\nare corroborated. And that corroboration tends to support the credibility of her statement that she \\nformed the belief that Mr. Di Luciano had operated his SUV while impaired by alcohol.  \\n \\nThe Parties’ Positions \\n[57] \\nDefence counsel take the position that PC Swiderski embellished her evidence about the odour \\nof alcohol at trial. Citing R. v. Kiss, 2018 ONCA 184, at para. 52, they say that the embellishment \\nundermines her credibility. She purposefully exaggerated her evidence in an attempt to influence the \\njury. Doing so, they say, “calls into question…what she in fact observed and her credibility as a witness \\noverall.” \\n[58] \\nDefence counsel submit that PC Swiderski’s trial evidence calls into question the evidence she \\ngave on the voir dire and, as such, is a material change justifying a re-opening of the voir dire.  \\n[59] \\nCrown counsel takes the position that PC Swiderski’s use of the word “reeked” when describing \\nthe odour of alcohol emanating from Mr. Di Luciano should not undermine her credibility.  He \\nadvances two reasons. First, because the trial was the first time she had been specifically asked to give \\na qualitative assessment of the odour.  Second, because “reeked” is synonymous with a “strong odour” \\nand simply another way to explain to the jury the intensity of the odour.  It is not inconsistent with the \\nobservation recorded in her contemporaneous notes. \\n[60] \\nCrown counsel submits that, in any event, all of the factors that supported PC Swiderski’s \\ncredibility during the voir dire are still present. Even if the court agrees that she embellished her \\nevidence at trial, it would not undermine the conclusion that she had honestly formed the belief, prior \\nto his arrest, that he had operated his SUV at a time when his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol. \\nConclusion \\n[61] \\nFor the reasons I set out earlier, I agree with defence counsel that PC Swiderski’s use of the \\nword “reeked” was an embellishment.   \\n[62] \\nAt the same time, however, I agree with Crown counsel that had the same evidence been given \\nat the voir dire, it would not likely have made a difference. \\n[63] \\nRecall that there was no preliminary hearing in this case. In the result, the first time PC \\nSwiderski testified about her observations of Mr. Di Luciano prior to arresting him was during the voir \\ndire.  Had she testified at the voir dire that Mr. Di Luciano “reeked” of alcohol, her testimony could \\nonly be contrasted with the observation she recorded in her police notebook to the effect that there was \\na strong odour of alcohol.   In my view, to the extent that “strong odour” and “reeked” are inconsistent \\nterms, the inconsistency is of a minor nature.  \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n10 \\n \\n \\n[64] \\nIt was the use of the term “reeked”, coupled with PC Swiderski’s demeanour when she uttered \\nthe term before the jury, that supports the conclusion that she was purposefully embellishing. \\n[65] \\nI am prepared, for the sake of argument, to go a little further and assume that there was a basis \\nduring the voir dire to conclude that PC Swiderski embellished her description of the potency of the \\nodour of alcohol on Mr. Di Luciano’s breath.  Would such a conclusion likely have made a difference?  \\nAgain, in my view, no.  \\n[66] \\nI reach this conclusion because to find that PC Swiderski did not honestly believe that Mr. Di \\nLuciano had operated his SUV while his ability to do so was impaired, I would have to find that either: \\n(a) \\nShe did not observe the indicia of impairment that she said she did; or,  \\n(b) \\nShe made the observations she claimed to have made, but nevertheless did not actually \\nform the belief that Mr. Di Luciano was operating his vehicle while impaired by alcohol. \\n[67] \\nIn all of the circumstances, neither of those conclusions would be likely, even if I had found on \\nthe voir dire that PC Swiderski overstated the intensity of the odour of alcohol.  \\n[68] \\nAs for the first possibility, I point out that PC Swiderski’s observations were generally \\ncorroborated.  For instance: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nHer compendious impression that Mr. Di Luciano was impaired was corroborated by the \\nindependent witness, Mr. Bonello, who closely interacted with Mr. Di Luciano and \\nformed the same opinion; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nHer observation that Mr. Di Luciano was unsteady on his feet was corroborated by Mr. \\nBonello; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nHer observation that Mr. Di Luciano had an odour of alcohol on his breath was \\ncorroborated by Mr. Bonello and PC Deol; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nHer observation that Mr. Di Luciano was slurring his words was corroborated by Mr. \\nBonello and S/Sgt. Armstrong; and, \\n\\uf0b7 \\nHer observation that Mr. Di Luciano had red and watery eyes was corroborated by S/Sgt. \\nArmstrong. \\n[69] \\nIn addition, there were witness accounts that Mr. Di Luciano was “all over the road” \\nimmediately prior to the collision. \\n[70] \\nAs for the second possibility, in light of all the prevailing circumstances, it would strike me as \\nunlikely that PC Swiderski would not form the subjective belief that Mr. Di Luciano operated his SUV \\nat a time when his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol.   \\n[71] \\nA conclusion, on the voir dire, that she had embellished the potency of the smell of alcohol \\nwould undoubtedly be concerning.  Purposeful embellishment is dishonest.  Having said that, it would \\nnot in my view, in all the circumstances, materially affect the conclusion that she had an honest, \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n11 \\n \\n \\nsubjective belief that Mr. Di Luciano operated his SUV while his ability to do so was impaired.  It \\nwould suggest to me that she was too earnest in her attempt to persuade others to share her belief.  \\n[72] \\nThe requirement that her subjective belief be objectively reasonable in all the circumstances, \\nacts as somewhat of a check on her zeal. Leaving aside the divergent observations of the odour of \\nalcohol, if any, there were sufficient other indicia of impairment to satisfy the objective reasonableness \\nstandard.  \\n \\n \\n \\n[73] \\nIn the result, I am not satisfied that PC Swiderski’s trial testimony constitutes a material change \\nin circumstances that would justify re-opening the Charter application.  Mr. Di Luciano’s motion is \\ntherefore dismissed. \\n \\n \\n \\nC. Boswell J. \\n \\nReleased: March 28, 2023 \\n2024 ONSC 1813 (CanLII)\\n',\n",

STOTHART J. \\nOverview \\n[1] \\nThe appellant, Jessica Duval, appeals against the sentence imposed by Justice L. Kim of \\nthe Ontario Court of Justice on January 31, 2024. \\n[2] \\nOn January 31, 2024, the appellant pled guilty to operating a conveyance while having \\nover 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of her blood. Following her plea, the Crown and \\ndefence presented a joint sentencing position. The presiding judge rejected the joint submission \\nand imposed a 6-month conditional sentence order and a 12-month driving prohibition.  \\n[3] \\nThe appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred when he departed from the joint \\nposition. The Crown, as respondent, agrees.  \\nThe facts before the sentencing judge \\n[4] \\nThe facts presented in support of the guilty plea were that on December 12, 2023, the \\nappellant was operating a motor vehicle when she hit the centre median on Barrydowne Avenue \\nin the City of Sudbury.   \\n[5] \\nThe police subsequently located the appellant sitting in the driver’s seat of the motor \\nvehicle, which was parked in a driveway nearby. The vehicle had damage to the front end, \\nconsistent with the earlier collision. The appellant exhibited several indicators of alcohol \\nimpairment and was placed under arrest.  \\n2024 ONSC 1829 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n[6] \\nThe appellant was taken to police headquarters, where she provided two samples of her \\nbreath into an approved instrument. An analysis of those breath samples revealed she had a blood \\nalcohol concentration between 220-230 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood.  \\nThe proceedings at sentencing \\n[7] \\nAs part of sentencing, the court was advised that the appellant was 35 years old and had no \\nprior criminal record. She was gainfully employed and had the support of her family. The appellant \\nwas remorseful for her actions, apologized to the court and was prepared to abide by any order that \\nthe court made.  \\n[8] \\nThe court was advised that there had been discussions about the case between the Crown \\nand the defence. As part of the plea and sentencing, the crown conceded that there were triable \\nissues had the matter gone to trial.  \\n[9] \\nThe Crown and defence jointly submitted that in the circumstances a $2000 fine and a 12-\\nmonth driving prohibition should be imposed.   \\n[10] \\nFollowing these submissions, the trial judge advised counsel that he had serious concerns \\nabout the joint submission. He noted that the breath readings were high, the physical indica of \\nimpairment were strong, there had been an accident, and the appellant had left the scene. The trial \\njudge expressed his opinion that these aggravating factors called for a term of imprisonment.  \\n[11] \\nThe trial judge then asked counsel for further submissions with respect to whether the court \\nshould impose a term of counselling as part of probation, given that the parties were not submitting \\nthat a jail sentence be imposed.   \\n[12] \\nThe court took a break so that the Crown and defence could speak about this and provide \\nfurther submissions to the court.  \\n[13] \\nWhen the parties returned, counsel for the appellant provided the court with additional \\nsubmissions in support of the joint submission. These included: \\na. That it was a very early plea, within a week of receiving initial disclosure; \\nb. That the appellant was foregoing possible Charter applications that could have been \\nbrought at a trial, including an issue of overholding and the failure to provide a Prosper \\nwarning; and \\nc. That the appellant was a young professional, who would be significantly hampered in \\nher profession because of the criminal conviction. \\n[14] \\nCounsel for the appellant advised the court that they had discussed the matter further and \\ngiven the trial judge’s concerns it was now jointly submitted that if the court was considering not \\n2024 ONSC 1829 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\ngoing along with the joint submission, that a six-month probationary period with counselling could \\nbe added to the sentence.  \\n[15] \\nFollowing these additional submissions, the trial judge asked for further submissions with \\nrespect to how the sentence proposed would meet the sentencing principles of general deterrence, \\ndenunciation and proportionality given the aggravating facts. The trial judge then went on to \\nexpress his concerns about the seriousness of the offence and that he felt the sentence being \\nproposed was manifestly unfit and that there should be a term of imprisonment.  \\n[16] \\nThe trial judge then asked the parties if they had a problem with a term of imprisonment to \\nbe served in the community that included terms of house arrest and counselling, in addition to the \\nfine.  \\n[17] \\nCounsel for the appellant provided further submissions to the trial judge, reiterating that \\nboth counsel for the appellant and counsel for the Crown had sat down and discussed what was \\nreasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, having regard to the strength of the Crown’s case, \\nthe personal circumstances of the appellant and the societal impact of the offence.  \\n[18] \\n Having heard further submissions, the trial judge stated that in accordance with R v. \\nAnthony Cook, if the sentence is so unfit that it brought the administration of justice into disrepute, \\nthat he did not have to accept the joint submission. The trial judge then asked for further \\nsubmissions on whether a conditional sentence should be imposed.  \\n[19] \\nCounsel for the appellant made further submissions, indicating that he felt a conditional \\nsentence was too high, repeating many of the prior submissions about the circumstances of the \\noffender. Crown counsel then provided submissions setting out why the joint submissions had \\nbeen arrived at and why it would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  \\n[20] \\nHaving heard the additional submissions, the trial judge rejected the new joint submission. \\nThe trial judge found that the joint submission was not appropriate and would bring the \\nadministration of justice into disrepute because the offence was one worthy of imprisonment given \\nthe aggravating factors, the gravity of the offence, and because in his view the public was not \\ngetting the message about the grave dangers associated with drinking and driving. The trial judge \\nthen imposed a six-month conditional sentence and a one-year driving prohibition.  \\nAnalysis \\n[21] \\nA joint position on sentencing following a guilty plea should only be rejected in exceptional \\nor rare cases. This is because such positions are vitally important to the well-being of our criminal \\njustice system. Joint positions help resolve cases and promote a fair and efficient criminal justice \\nsystem. As such, deference to joint positions is the rule and not the exception. R v. Anthony-Cook, \\n2016 SCC 43 at para. 25; R v. Fuller, 2020 ONCA 115 at para. 16. \\n2024 ONSC 1829 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n[22] \\nThe effective and efficient operation of our justice system relies on litigants enjoying a \\nhigh degree of confidence that the joint submission will be accepted when guilty pleas are entered. \\nR v. Fuller at para. 17; R v. Harasuik, 2023 ONCA 594 at paras. 21-22.  \\n[23] \\nA joint position should only be interfered with in circumstances where the proposed \\nsentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or is otherwise not in the public \\ninterest.  \\n[24] \\nIn R v. Anthony-Cook, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the application of the “fitness \\ntest” to joint submissions. The fitness test provided that a trial judge could depart from a joint \\nsubmission if, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the applicable sentencing \\nprinciples, they concluded that the proposed sentence was not fit. Instead, the court adopted a \\n“public interest” test that was more stringent in order to reflect the many benefits that joint \\nsubmissions bring to the criminal justice system and the corresponding need for a high degree of \\ncertainty in them.  R v. Anthony-Cook, at para. 31.  \\n[25] \\nIn R v. Anthony-Cook, at para. 34, Justice Moldaver described the public interest as follows: \\na joint submission should not be rejected lightly…Rejection denotes \\na submission so unhinged from the circumstances of the offence and \\nthe offender that its acceptance would lead reasonable and informed \\npersons, aware of all the circumstances, including the importance of \\npromoting certainty in resolution discussions, to believe that the \\nproper functioning of the justice system had broken down. This is \\nan undeniably high threshold… \\n[26] \\nThe Supreme Court set out in detail why such a stringent test is required before a joint \\nsubmission can be rejected. From the perspective of an accused person, the court recognized that \\nmost accused persons will not give up their right to a trial on the merits, and all of the procedural \\nsafeguards that it entails, unless they have some assurance that the trial judge will, in most \\ninstances, honour agreements entered into by the Crown.  R v. Anthony-Cook at para. 37.  \\n[27] \\nThe Supreme Court also recognized that there are several benefits to certainty in joint \\nsubmissions from the Crown’s perspective, including that the Crown’s case may have flaws; there \\nmay be information that an accused can provide that is invaluable to other investigations or \\nprosecutions; and there may be a benefit to the victim or witnesses. Further, the Crown benefits \\nfrom a sense of certainty that what it has determined to be in the public interest will not be undercut. \\nR .v Anthony-Cook at paras. 38-39.   \\n[28] \\nFinally, the Supreme Court recognized that there are benefits to the criminal justice system \\nat large, including the fact that guilty pleas save precious time, resources, and expenses, that can \\nbe channeled into other matters. Justice Moldaver noted at para. 40: \\nThis is no small benefit.  To the extent that they avoid trials, joint \\nsubmissions on sentence permit our justice system to function more \\n2024 ONSC 1829 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nefficiently.  Indeed, I would argue that they permit it to function. \\nWithout them, our justice system would be brought to its knees, and \\neventually collapse under its own weight.  \\n[29] \\nI would note that the comments of Justice Moldaver in R v. Anthony-Cook pre-date the \\nCOVID pandemic of 2020/2021 which saw the shut-down of courts and the postponement of trials, \\nsomething unseen in the history of our justice system. The effects of the COVID pandemic \\ncontinue to this day and courts continue to struggle to keep up with the ensuing backlog and the \\nincreasing demands placed on our criminal justice system. This adds to the public importance of \\nearly resolution of criminal matters.     \\n[30] \\nThere is no question that the appellant committed a serious offence. There is also no \\nquestion that there were aggravating factors surrounding the commission of the offence. They \\nincluded hitting the median on the road; leaving the scene and parking nearby; and the appellant \\nhaving almost three times the amount of alcohol legally permitted in her bloodstream.  \\n[31] \\nHowever, there were other significant mitigating factors, including an early plea, a plea in \\nthe face of what both the Crown and defence agreed that were triable issues; a youthful offender \\nwith no prior criminal record; a genuine expression of remorse; the appellant’s unique personal \\ncircumstances including her health challenges; and the specific impact that a criminal record would \\nhave on the appellant given her profession.  \\n[32] \\nWhile the trial judge referred to test as set out in R v. Anthony-Cook, when his reasons are \\nread as a whole, they reflect the application of the fitness test. The trial judge was concerned that \\nthe sentence was not fit when assessed against the nature of the offence, the circumstances of the \\noffence, the circumstances of the offender and the fundamental principles of sentencing.    \\n[33] \\nAs stated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R v. Harasuik, at para. 24, a trial judge must \\nnot only explain why the sentence did not accord with the aggravating circumstances and the \\napplicable sentencing principles in the case, he or she must also explain why the joint submission \\nis so unhinged from reality that it would cause a reasonable person to believe that the proper \\nfunctioning of the justice system had broken down.   \\n[34] \\nIt is clear that the trial judge felt that there were aggravating features in this case that did \\nnot support the imposition of the minimum penalty provided for the offence. It is also clear that \\nthe trial judge felt that general deterrence was not met with the sentence being proposed.   \\n[35] \\nThat being said, the trial judge’s reasons do not explain why the joint submission in this \\ncase, which was lenient, made this one of those “rare” and “exceptional” circumstances where the \\njoint submission was “so unhinged from the circumstances of the offence and the offender that its \\nacceptance would lead reasonable and informed persons, aware of all the circumstances, including \\nthe importance of promoting certainty in resolution discussions, to believe that the proper \\nfunctioning of the justice system had broken down”. \\n2024 ONSC 1829 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n[36] \\nIn my view, there was no basis to reject the joint submission proposed. A reasonable \\ninformed member of the public, aware of all of the circumstances, including not only the \\nseriousness of the offence but also the appellant’s lack of criminal record, early acceptance of \\nresponsibility, her remorse, the fact that she gave up her right to trial, the Crown’s acceptance that \\nthere were triable issues, and the importance of promoting efficiency and certainty in the criminal \\njustice system by way of timely resolutions, would not conclude that the justice system had broken \\ndown.  \\n[37] \\nFor these reasons, the appeal is allowed, and the sentence is varied to a $2000 fine, to \\nreflect the joint submission proposed. The appellant did not seek a stay of her driving prohibition, \\nand so it will continue to run for the 1-year period imposed.   \\n \\n \\n \\nJustice S.K.

ROBERTS, J.: \\n   \\nOVERVIEW \\n[1] \\nFollowing an eight-week trial, I found Vito Bailey-Ricketts guilty of trafficking fentanyl and \\ncocaine in Thunder Bay, in association with a criminal organization (the Eglinton West Crips or \\nEWC), over the two-month period set out in the indictment.  I also found that he was a high-level \\nmember of the EWC who directed lower-level members of the EWC, namely Carlton Jones and \\nKG, to traffic in cocaine and fentanyl, by bringing drugs north, and selling them in Thunder Bay. \\n[2] \\nCounsel agree about how the sentence should be approached.  They agree that a sentence \\nshould be fashioned for trafficking in fentanyl, and the trafficking in cocaine, possession of \\nfentanyl and cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, and possession of proceeds, from April 21 and \\nMay 7, 2020, should be considered in understanding the nature of the trafficking, and the sentences \\nfor these other non-criminal organization counts made concurrent.  Counsel differ only on the \\nappropriate sentence for trafficking in fentanyl: the Crown says it should be 8 years; the defence \\nsays 6 years. \\n[3] \\nCounsel also agree that the Criminal Code requires that the sentence for trafficking in \\nassociation with a criminal organization be consecutive to the substantive trafficking offence.  \\nThey also agree that the two additional criminal organization counts should be concurrent.  Again, \\nthey differ only on the number:  the Crown says it should be 6 years; defence says 2 years. \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n[4] \\nIn all the circumstances of these offences and this offender, I believe that a total sentence of \\n13 years is the minimum sentence that will adequately provide for general deterrence and \\ndenunciation in the circumstances of this case. \\nCIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE \\n[5] \\nI gave lengthy reasons explaining why I found Mr. Bailey-Ricketts guilty of counts 23-27 of \\nthe indictment:  R. v. Bailey-Ricketts, 2023 ONCS 4721.  I list these counts in Appendix A to the \\nreasons for judgment.  Much of the evidence at the trial came from intercepted communications \\nthat Justice Code ruled admissible in R. v. McPherson and 49 Others, 2023 ONSC 232. \\n[6] \\nIn a nutshell, I found that in the spring of 2020, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was selling cocaine and \\nfentanyl in Thunder Bay, where he could sell for higher prices than in Toronto, in association with \\nand for the benefit of a criminal organization, namely the EWC.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was assisted \\nin his trafficking operation by other members of the EWC, including Carlton Jones, KG, and \\nAmmaan Charley.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was a high-ranking member of the EWC and gave \\ndirection to Mr. Jones and KG in their trafficking.   \\n[7] \\nI found that Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was using his grandmother’s home at 568 Lauder Avenue, \\nwhere he lived growing up, and from time to time as an adult, as a stash house for drugs.  Mr. \\nBailey-Ricketts and the EWC also used 568 Lauder Avenue as a safe place to meet.  Police \\nsurveillance, both live and through a covert camera, and LBS data associated with the devices \\nbeing intercepted, showed people associated with the EWC, including Mr. Bailey-Ricketts, Mr. \\nCharley, and KG, repeatedly attending at 568 Lauder Avenue, often at the same time.  For example, \\nKG attended at 568 Lauder Avenue on the evening of April 20, shortly before heading north with \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts and Victoria Ditmer.  The LBS data associated to Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s \\ntelephone put Mr. Bailey-Ricketts in the same area at the same time.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts described \\nhimself as being in the “zone” when in the vicinity of 568 Lauder Avenue, a term he also used to \\ndescribe his location when in Thunder Bay trafficking drugs. \\n[8] \\nMr. Jones and KG were younger, lower level members of the EWC.  Mr. Jones carried drugs \\nto Thunder Bay in March 2020, and sold them in association with and at Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s \\ninstruction.  The intercepts captured Mr. Bailey-Ricketts advising Mr. Jones how to carry drugs \\nnorth (“ball it”), and what buses to take to get to Thunder Bay.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts picked Mr. \\nJones up from the bus depot.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts instructed Mr. Jones to keep the “trizzie”, or \\ndrug house, low key in order to avoid conflict with other trizzies affiliated with gangs.  During a \\nperiod when sales were slow, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts reminded Mr. Jones that baby bonus cheques \\nwere due out shortly (intercepted conversation, March 11, 2020, Vol.III, item 3). \\n[9] \\nKG was carrying drugs north for Mr. Bailey-Ricketts when he, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts, and Ms. \\nDitmer were stopped just north of Barrie and arrested on April 21, 2020.  KG was 17.  Ms. Ditmer, \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts’s girlfriend-driver-drug selling agent was also carrying drugs for Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts.  She was 18.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was not personally carrying any drugs, or anything of \\ninterest to police. \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n[10] More specifically, Ms. Ditmer was carrying the following in the front pouch of her sweater \\npocket: \\n(a) \\nA purple rock, weighing 0.6 grams, found wrapped in brown packing tape inside a \\nblack glove (assigned Canada Health certificate #ON0081664 and found to contain \\nfentanyl); \\n(b) \\nA dark purple rock, weighing 1.0 grams (assigned Canada Health certificate \\n#ON0081665 and found to contain opium and some form of Fentanyl); \\n(c) \\nA purple rock weighing 6.5 grams inside the brown packing tape and black glove \\n(a 1 g sample assigned Canada Health certificate #ON0081666 and found to contain \\nheroin and fentanyl); and \\n(d) \\n57.8 g of a chunk of white powder (1.2 g sample assigned Canada Health certificate \\n#ON0081667 and found to contain cocaine and phenacetin). \\n[11] KG was carrying the following drugs in his bag, together additional packages of what \\nappeared to be cocaine, a digital scale, plastic gloves, and packaging material:  \\n(i) \\nA 20.9 g light purple rock (2 g sample assigned Canada Health certificate \\n#ON0081668 and found to contain heroin, fentanyl, and caffeine); \\n(ii) \\nA 44.5 g dark purple rock (a sample assigned Canada Health certificate \\n#ON0081669 and found to contain heroin, fentanyl, benzodiazepine, and caffeine); \\n(iii) \\n59.1 g of white rocks tied up in plastic (0.6 g sample assigned Canada Health \\ncertificate #ON0081670 found to contain cocaine). \\n[12] Mr. Charley assisted Mr. Bailey-Ricketts with his Thunder Bay trafficking program, \\ngenerally helping to staff and protect it.  Mr. Charley was also a high-ranking member of the EWC, \\nand a close-confident of Mr. Bailey-Ricketts.  He dropped Jose Lopez-Valencia in Thunder Bay \\non March 29, 2020.  Mr. Lopez-Valencia helped Mr. Bailey-Ricketts with his Thunder Bay \\ntrafficking program by selling drugs.  Mr. Charley coordinated the involvement of KG, who \\ntravelled north with Mr. Bailey-Ricketts on April 21, 2020 carrying drugs, as I have described.  \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts, Ms. Ditmer, and KG were all released later the same day that they were \\narrested.  A few days later, on April 25, Mr. Charley asked KG to get boys to help with the Thunder \\nBay trafficking operation.   \\n[13] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was arrested again on May 7, 2020 while Ms. Ditmer was driving him \\nto a drug deal for “3 points” of “Dizz” for $100.  Based on the expert evidence about the meaning \\nof Dizz, the amount sold and the price and location (Thunder Bay where prices were higher than \\nToronto), and the state of the market for heroin (street levels sales almost invariably included \\nfentanyl), I am satisfied that Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was purporting to sell a drug which included \\nfentanyl.  Upon arrest, cocaine and disposable gloves were found in his car: \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n(1) \\na small clear plastic bag containing a blue rock like substance that looked like \\nfentanyl was on the floor of the front passenger seat (as shown in photographs 8, \\n15, 20 of exhibit 38); it weighed 1.8 g and proved to contain cocaine (LL0371781); \\n(2) \\na box of disposable gloves on the floor adjacent to the rear passenger side seat. \\n[14] More cocaine, cash, and a digital scale were found in room 127 of the Econo Lodge, which \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts was using at the time to sell drugs:   \\n(a) a baggie containing what appeared to be cocaine and fentanyl was under top right \\ncorner of the mattress (when standing at the bottom of the bed and looking toward \\nthe top); the white powder weighed 8.5 g and contained cocaine (ON0029276); the \\nblue crystal substance weighed 21.2 g and contained cocaine and phenacetin \\n(ON0029277); \\n(b) a black digital scale in working order with white residue; and \\n(c) the jacket in photo in ex 40 (worn by Mr. Bailey-Ricketts during his arrest on April \\n21, 2020, and when he was observed by police during surveillance on March 29, \\n2020) was found in the closet with $255 Canadian cash and the receipt for a $250 \\nhotel room deposit in the pockets. \\n[15] In addition, cocaine and drug trafficking paraphernalia such as a digital scale and cutting \\nagent were found at 369 North Syndicate Avenue North, a location Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was also \\nusing to traffic drugs. \\nRule Against Multiple Convictions \\n[16] The “rule” against multiple convictions (the \"Kienapple\" principle) rule is essentially a \\nprinciple of fairness that prevents an accused from being convicted of multiple offences arising \\nfrom the same transaction where the elements of the offences are substantially the same, i.e. there \\nis both a factual and legal nexus.  In such cases the accused should only be convicted of the most \\nserious offence, and the other offences should be conditionally stayed:  R. v. Kienapple (1974), 15 \\nC.C.C. (2d) 524 (S.C.C.); R. v. Prince (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (S.C.C.). \\n[17] Despite the complexity and overlapping nature of the indictment, counsel are in agreement \\nthat the \"Kienapple\" principle largely does not apply in this case.  Counsel jointly submit that the \\nonly count caught by the Kienapple principle is count 20, a conspiracy between Ammaan Charley \\nand Mr. Bailey-Ricketts and others to traffic in controlled substances in Thunder Bay.  Counsel \\nagree that, in the particular circumstances of this case, this count is effectively subsumed in count \\n19, which charged Ammaan Charley and Mr. Bailey-Ricketts with conspiracy to traffic in a \\ncontrolled substance in Thunder Bay in association with a criminal organization for the same time \\nperiod.  I agree.  Unlike R. v. Evans, 2013 ONSC 7003 at para. 96, there is the necessary factual \\noverlap in this case; it is the same conspiracy, over the same time period.  I agree with counsel that \\nKienapple does not apply to any of the other counts. \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n[18] However, the principle of totality must be carefully considered.  Not only can the various \\nsubstantive counts be seen as “a single criminal adventure”, but I agree with counsel that the \\nprinciple of totality requires concurrent sentences:  R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9 at para.155.  I also \\nagree with the particular approach suggested by counsel: sentence on trafficking in fentanyl (count \\n22) and make the sentences on the other non-criminal organization counts concurrent.  These other \\ncounts inform the nature of the trafficking, sometimes as aggravating circumstances, and should \\nnot receive separate consecutive sentences. \\n[19] Section 467.14 of the Criminal Code mandates that the sentence for conspiracy to traffic in \\nThunder Bay for the benefit of or in association with a criminal organization (count 19), during \\nthe same period as the substantive charge of trafficking, be consecutive.  As Justice Dambrot \\nexplained in R. v. Evans (trial decision), s.467.14 effectively provides for an aggravated form of \\nthe underlying offence (in this case trafficking) where it is committed for the benefit of, or in \\nassociation with, a criminal organization.  Counsel agree, as do I, that the other two criminal \\norganization counts (counts 17 and 18) should be concurrent to count 19 in recognition of the \\nprinciple of totality.  \\nCIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER \\n[20] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts did not testify at the trial.  But I spent a lot of time with him in court, \\nand heard a lot about him, and sometimes from him, in the course of listening to the intercepted \\ncommunications.  He was guarded on the telephone, often punctuating or ending a conversation \\nwith “don’t say a word”.  He was captured speaking feely on the car probe.  He sat at counsel table \\nthroughout the trial.  He was always dressed immaculately and always behaved impeccably.   \\n[21] A detailed PSR was prepared.  The PSR writer consulted the following sources: \\nVito Bailey-Ricketts, the subject of this report \\nSandra Thompson, the subject’s mother \\nOnega Ricketts, the subject’s grandmother \\nKashawna Bogle, the subject’s common law partner \\nSacha Cleary, the subject’s sister \\nJamar Harrison, the subject’s brother \\nAntonio Carvallo, the subject’s friend \\nShawn Bogle, the mother of the subject’s common law partner \\nYvonne Williams, the subject’s great aunt \\nToronto Police Service Records \\nCanadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) \\nMinistry of the Solicitor General Records  \\n \\n[22] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was born in Jamaica on September 8, 1987.  He is currently 36 years \\nold.  He has two older brothers and two younger sisters.  \\n \\n[23] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s early childhood was spent with his mother and younger sister in \\nJamaica.  They lived in a one-bedroom home.  The toilet was outside.  There were other similar \\nhomes nearby and the main road was about 10 minutes away.  It was a dangerous area, and it was \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nnot safe to be outside about 5 pm.  His mother worked a lot to support the family.  Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts had a very good relationship with her. \\n[24] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s father lived in New York City.  He died of gun violence in 1992, when \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts was 9.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts never knew his father.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s \\nmother reported that Mr. Bailey-Ricketts “saw his father for the first time in a casket”. \\n[25] After his father died, when he was 10, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was adopted by his paternal \\ngrandmother Onega Ricketts in Toronto, in order for him to have a better life.  He moved in with \\nhis grandmother, and her then husband, in the neighbourhood of Dufferin and Eglinton.  They \\nlived in a detached three bedroom home with a yard and an unfinished basement.  His older brother \\nmoved in with them, at a later time.  He sister Sacha Cleary visited in summer (Ms. Cleary grew \\nup in New York but spent summers in Toronto).   \\n[26] Mrs. Ricketts was a strict disciplinarian.  She was also loving.  Her then husband could be \\nabusive, both to her and Mr. Bailey-Ricketts.  Mrs. Ricketts struggled with alcohol abuse when \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts was growing up but has no current issues with alcohol.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts \\nnotes that he was and still is very close to her.  Mrs. Ricketts was in court almost every day of this \\nlengthy trial and sentencing.   \\n[27] Ms. Cleary described the area of her grandmother’s home as a nice quiet neighbourhood.  \\nThey would go to the park, pools and she never saw any drugs, weapons, or violence.  Jamar \\nHarrison, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s older brother, described the neighbourhood as “good and bad”.  It \\nwas diverse, with many family-oriented businesses, a lot of basketball courts, a tight knit \\ncommunity that hosted street festivals.  The bad side “was it was a low-income area, there was a \\nnightlife ‘where stuff went on,’ ‘people died out there,’ raids happened, and there were a lot of \\nproblems.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s friend, Antonio Carvallo, described the neighbourhood as having \\na lot of “mom and pop shops” but also issues with drug dealing and rival gangs.  Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts described the Dufferin/Eglington area near his grandmother’s home as: \\n“hustling and bustling’ being a mix of storefronts, houses, high rises, \\nand multiple bars… there were many people inside and outside of these \\nbars selling illicit substances… there were certain bars where it was \\nwell known anything could be sold out of….he was exposed to \\nsignificant violent issues from a young age…[including seeing] an \\nindividual be fatally shot in the head, multiple stabbings, as well as \\nnumerous illicit drug transactions which often led to violence such as \\nrobberies, shootings, and stabbings…. parties would run through the \\nnight where he would see people drinking, smoking, and consuming \\nillicit drugs. \\n[28] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts did not flourish at school.  After moving to Canada, he was identified \\nas having a learning disability.  (I cannot help but wonder whether there was actually a language \\nissue as the evidence in this trial shows Mr. Bailey-Ricketts to be highly intelligent and highly \\ncapable.)  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts excelled at track and field, particularly running, but did not achieve \\nhis potential.  He reported that his grandmother missed signing a permission slip in grade 8, there \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nwas “an issue” in grade 9 (he was expelled due to an allegation of sexual assault in gym class, \\nwhich was ultimately dismissed), and his school in grade 10 did not have a track and field team  \\n(he attended a specialized school due to his learning disability up to grade 10, transferring to an \\nordinary public school in grade 11.)  His school in grade 11 did have a track team, but, by that \\ntime,  “he was focused on his activities outside of school”.  He was suspended and ultimately \\nexpelled for lack of attendance.  He went to Jamaica the following year and never returned to \\nschool. He reported that he is working on completing his high school diploma in custody.  On the \\nfirst date of sentencing submissions, counsel submitted that he is “one assignment away” from \\ncompleting it.  On the second date, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts reported that he had completed the \\nassignment. \\n[29] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts began to hang out with “the wrong crowd”, and did not graduate from \\nhigh school.  His friend Antonio Carvallo noted that he and Mr. Bailey-Ricketts “were exposed to \\ncriminal activity from a young age, had no supervision, and had no rules”.  He noted that Mr. \\nBailey-Ricketts’s male role models were “not the best people to look up to”.  Their shared friends \\nare either “dead, deported, or in jail.” \\n[30] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s grandmother reported that, throughout his life, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts \\nhas been targeted by police due to his race.  His partner, Ms. Bogle, noted he was frequently \\nstopped by police, carded, and discriminated against.  She noted he experienced significant trauma \\nbeing separated from his mother and sister in Jamaica.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s brother Jamar \\nHarrison also believed Mr. Bailey-Ricketts had been unfairly targeted by police throughout his \\nlife, including in relation to the instant case.  (I cannot accept this latter assertion.  The evidence \\nin this case comes from intercepted communications ruled lawful, supported by extensive \\nsurveillance, as described in my reasons for judgment.  I found it overwhelmingly established the \\ncharges set out in the indictment.)  All noted that Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was in a serious car accident \\nthat left him badly injured and traumatized.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s friend Antonio Carvallo noted \\nthat Mr. Bailey-Ricketts “witnessed crime and violence as a child, was “carded” and discriminated \\nagainst due to his race, and noted there were issues within the neighbourhood that caused fights \\nand disputes.  He also stated it was traumatic for the subject to grow up without either of his \\nparents.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts reported being targeted due to his race from a young age, including \\nthe sexual assault allegations in grade 9, and being stopped and frisked by police while walking \\non Eglinton as a teenager.  He was first arrested at 19, after being stopped “for no reason”.  He \\nclaimed he was stopped so often by police when driving that he stopped driving in Toronto. (I note \\nhe has a criminal record for impaired driving from 2016 which may also have something to do \\nwith his decision to stop driving.) \\n[31] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts noted that around grade 10 he started spending more time on Eglinton \\n“to be noticed and to feel like he belonged to something”.  By 17 he was part of the Eglinton West \\nCrips (EWC) and was selling drugs to support himself and his grandmother.  He advised the PSR \\nwriter that “he was mainly involved with EWC from the ages of 17-20” but is not currently \\nassociated with the gang, though some of his friends are.  (This is contrary to the evidence at trial, \\nand my factual findings, and I cannot rely on it.  I found him to be a high-ranking member of the \\nEWC.) \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\n[32] Mrs. Ricketts noted that she knows some of Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s friends and described \\nthem as “good boys” he grew up with who are not part of a gang.  This is inconsistent with some \\nof Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s admissions to the PSR writer.  It is also inconsistent with my factual \\nfindings at trial.  I found that Mr. Bailey-Ricketts used his grandmother’s home as a stash house \\nand meeting place for the EWC.  While I believe Mrs. Ricketts is well-meaning, I cannot place \\nweight on this statement. \\n[33] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts worked at a fast food restaurant between the ages of around 16 to 18 in \\norder to help his grandmother.  He advised that, after this, he began to support himself and his \\nfamily through the sale of illicit drugs.  He reported doing some work through job agencies while \\nhe was 20 and 21, but “has not worked a formal job since that time”.  He claimed that he had \\nimmigration issues and was unable to work legally until these issues were resolved in 2021, when \\nhe became a Canadian citizen.  He explained that he was supported through “his grandmother, Ms. \\nBogle, reselling game systems, and occasional illicit drug transactions.”  His goal is to open his \\nown business so he can support his family in a pro-social way.  I have no doubt that he has the \\nability and skills do this.  The evidence I heard at trial shows him to be highly intelligent and highly \\nskilled. \\n[34] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts reports no concerns regarding substance use and addictions.  He \\nacknowledged that the illicit drugs at issue in this case were intended for sale. \\n[35] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts has a long-term partner, Kashawna Bogle.  They have been together for \\n14 years and have three children together, aged 14, 11, and 10.  The family lives in Mississauga.  \\nThey were separated at the time of the offences at issue in this case but have since reconciled.  Ms. \\nBogle describes Mr. Bailey-Ricketts as a loving and involved father.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s \\nmother, grandmother, great aunt Yvonne Williams, and sister Sacha Cleary, all say he is a good \\nfather. \\n[36] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts admitted to the PSR writer that he was in Thunder Bay for the purpose \\nof selling illicit drugs, but claimed he fell into this when he returned to living at his grandmother’s \\nhome: \\nHe stated while there some of his old friends were released from \\ncustody and they connected with him. He noted he needed money and \\ncould not legally work due to his ongoing immigration issues. He \\nreported he decided to sell illicit drugs in Thunder Bay to support his \\nfamily and agreed to provide a ride to an individual and was not aware \\nof what this individual was in possession of.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was \\naware his friends were in EWC, however, denied his activities were to \\nsupport EWC and noted he has his “own thing” which was separate \\nfrom EWC. \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts did not testify or call any evidence at the trial.

He is an active participant in the workshops – he asks \\nquestions and is very co-operative when called upon to answer \\nquestions…[and] display an eagerness to learn. \\n[39] Kashawna Bogle provided a letter of reference describing what an involved and caring father \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts is, and how much their children love, miss, and need him, especially their \\neldest son, noting “Young black men require the presence of their fathers in their lives in order to \\nbring about positive change.”  She asks “for a fair chance for the system to demonstrate that it is \\nmeant to rehabilitate our men rather than perpetuate the incarceration and oppression of the black \\ncommunity.”  She implores me not to punish him “for actions he did not commit”. \\n[40] All of Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s children, eldest son J, daughter V, and youngest son C, wrote \\nto me about how much they miss their Dad, and want him home, asking for mercy. \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nIMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY \\n[41] The Crown has filed local case law, and a number of reports, showing that the fentanyl crisis \\nis particularly acute in Thunder Bay (in 2023 it had the highest opiod-related mortality rate of any \\ncommunity in Ontario), and that the majority of drug traffickers arrested are from out of town.  \\nThe Crown materials include:   \\n\\uf0b7 R. v. Puentes-Reed & Yousuf, 2023 ONSC 1336 and 2023 ONSC 2555;  \\n\\uf0b7 Broken Trust – Indigenous People and the Thunder Bay Police Service”, Report by Gerry \\nMcNielly, Independent Police Review Director, Office of the Independent Police Review \\nDirector (December 2018);  \\n\\uf0b7 “Opioid Toxicity Mortality Rate By Census Subdivision (CSD) – Ten (10) CSDs with the \\nhighest mortality rates in 2023 (Q1 to Q3),” Chart prepared by the Office of the Chief \\nCoroner for Ontario (OCC), dated February 5, 2024;  \\n\\uf0b7 Affidavit of DC Matthew Veal of the Thunder Bay Police Service, Intelligence Branch, dated \\nFebruary 20, 2024, attaching a report prepared by the Thunder Bay Police Service \\nIntelligence Analyst Michelle Merko, dated January 18, 2024, comparing year end totals \\nfor drug investigations conducted by all branches of the Thunder Bay Police Service for \\nthe years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, and including statistical data from the OCC about \\noverdoses in Thunder Bay.  \\n[42] The expert evidence in Puentes-Reed echoes what the Crown proved happened in the instant \\ncase.  The trial judge, writing in 2022 and 2023, described the situation in Thunder Bay as follows \\n(at paras.24 – of his reasons for judgment): \\nIt is a notorious fact, regrettably, that there is, and has been for several \\nyears, a serious and organized drug trade being carried out in Thunder Bay.  \\nIt has been going on since before the pandemic hit in 2020.  This is driven \\nby the fact that the street price in Thunder Bay for illegal drugs is \\nsignificantly higher than it is in the more populous markets of Southern \\nOntario. \\n…[A] favoured method of distribution in Thunder Bay involves a dealer \\nor a gang of dealers taking over residential premises.  These dealers are, \\nmore often than not, not permanent residents of Thunder Bay.  They are \\nassisted by local residents, who often initially “consent’ to the takeover of \\na residence as a kind of storefront.  The out-of-town dealers arrive either \\nby air, bus or car.  They come prepared to stay here for as long as their \\nsupply lasts… \\nThis type of takeover of a residential property where sales are made to \\n“retail customers” causes the location to be known as a “trap house”. \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n[43] In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge noted that he was “acutely aware of the scourge that \\nthe active, violent, lucrative and apparently unending drug trade is having on the community of \\nThunder Bay and the Northwest Region….” \\nRANGE OF SENTENCE  \\n[44] I will focus on the two most significant offences in this case, trafficking in a schedule I \\nsubstance (fentanyl and cocaine in this case), and conspiracy to traffic in association with a \\ncriminal organization. \\n[45] Trafficking in a schedule I substance, contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and \\nSubstances Act (CDSA), is punishable by a maximum sentence of life.  There is no mandatory \\nminimum sentence.   \\n[46] The offence of trafficking captures a broad spectrum of conduct.  The range of sentence \\ngenerally reflects both the nature of the drug trafficked, and the nature of the trafficking involved.  \\nCocaine, heroin and fentanyl are all considered to be extremely serious drugs, toxic to entire \\ncommunities, with fentanyl replacing heroin as the “worst of the worst”.  Trafficking is considered \\nto fall within the following general hierarchy, from least to most serious: \\n(1) \\nStreet level seller – small hand-to-hand transactions, often an addict-trafficker; \\n(2) \\nStreet level supplier – transactions up to an “Eight-Ball” or one ounce;  \\n(3) \\nSupplier to street level supplier (mid-level) – multi-ounce transactions; \\n(4) \\nDistributor to Supplier (high-level) – one-half kilo to multi-kilo transactions;  \\n(5) \\nImporter to Distributor. \\nR. v. Haye, [2013] O.J. 6493 per Code J.A., aff’d [2014] O.J. No.6575 (C.A.) \\n \\n[47] Where the trafficking falls in the hierarchy will turn on all the circumstances, including the \\namounts trafficked, and the persistence of the trafficking.  In Haye, Justice Code explained that \\nthe amount of cocaine is most significant as a circumstance that helps situate the conduct in the \\ntrafficking hierarchy: \\nSentences are not calibrated by the precise amounts involved in the sense that \\nhaving 50 grams less in one case than another does not necessarily result in a \\ndiscount.  The main significance that attaches to the quantity possessed in drug \\ntrafficking sentencing is that it helps to give rise to an inference about the position \\nthat the accused occupies in the drug trafficking hierarchy.   \\n[48] Similarly, the persistence of the trafficking reveals information about its nature and place in \\nthe hierarchy.  As Justice Dambrot explained in R. v. Evans et al, 2013 ONSC 7003 (sentence \\nupheld in 2019 ONCA 715): \\n[W]hile the range of sentence for trafficking in small quantities of crack cocaine is \\nsix months to two years less a day, the range is higher when the offence involves \\nlong-term, persistent trafficking, particularly where that is the sole or primary \\nsource of the offender\\'s livelihood. One of the reasons for this is the fact that unlike \\nmost street dealers, who obtain a few grams of cocaine and then sell 1/4 or 1/2 gram \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\namounts, a persistent seller needs to obtain much larger quantities of cocaine, \\nsometimes even ounces of cocaine, and as a result must have access to vendors at \\na higher level in the chain of distribution. In such circumstances, I believe the range \\nto be two years less a day to four years. Where a street-level trafficker also \\noccasionally traffics at a wholesale level, the top of the range or higher is \\nappropriate. \\n[49] The range of sentence for cocaine trafficking is well-established:  approximately 6 months \\nto two years less a day for a “street-level” trafficker dealing in gram amounts of cocaine, amounts \\nless than an ounce; approximately 2-5 years for a “mid-level” trafficker, capable of supplying \\nounce amounts to street-level traffickers, and dealing in ounce levels:  R. v. Woolcock, [2002] O.J. \\nNo.4927 at para.15; R. v. Haye, supra at paras.10-12 (S.C.J); R. v. Ahmed, 2016 ONCA 831. \\n[50] The range of sentence for trafficking fentanyl is still being established.  In R. v. Parranto \\nand Felix, 2021 SCC 46 at para.68, a majority of the SCC noted cases across the country suggested \\na “national” range of 8 to 15 years for mid-level and/or wholesale trafficking, affirming 10 and 14 \\nyear sentences for two wholesale commercial traffickers who pleaded guilty (the former (Felix) \\nwas a first offender; the latter (Parranto) had a significant record but was Indigenous and entitled \\nto Gladue consideration).   \\n[51] In R. v. Lynch, 2022 ONCA 109, post-Parranto, the Ontario Court of Appeal approved a \\nrange of 6-8 years for mid-level trafficking in fentanyl.  Mr. Lynch, who had no criminal record, \\npleaded guilty to being in possession of 41.37 g of fentanyl, 965 g of cocaine, and 149.28 g of \\nMDMA for the purpose of trafficking.  His initial sentence of 4 years was increased to 6 years on \\nappeal.  \\n[52] More recently, in R. v. Owusu, 2024 ONSC 2024 and R. v Gordon-Brown, 2024 ONSC 1300, \\nafter a thorough analysis of Lynch and other authority from the Court of Appeal, and Parranto, \\nJustice Code put the range for a mid-level fentanyl trafficker dealing at the ounce and multi-ounce \\nlevel at 8 to 11 years.  Justice Code explicitly recognized, as do I, that Parranto and Felix involved \\nfentanyl trafficking at the wholesale level, but noted that the Supreme Court’s comments about the \\nseriousness of fentanyl and the significance of the amounts trafficked apply in the context of a \\nmid-level trafficker.  Justice Code also recognized that persistent trafficking over a sustained \\nperiod is a significant aggravating factor. \\n[53] Section 467.12 makes it an indictable offence to commit an indictable offence “for the \\nbenefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization”.  The maximum \\nsentence is 14 years.  There is no minimum sentence.  Section 467.14 explicitly provides that any \\nsentence for s.467.12 or 467.13 shall be consecutive to any other punishment for an offence arising \\nout of the same event or series of events:  s.467. 14 Criminal Code; R. v. Beauchamp, 2015 ONCA \\n260 at paras. 322-29.   Section 718.2(a)(iv) also provides that it is an aggravating factor to commit \\nan offence “in association with a criminal organization”.   \\n[54] Appellate courts have recognized that the essential objective of the criminal organization \\nlegislation is to protect society from the violence and other criminal activity of criminals who work \\ntogether as a group.  Such group activity poses an enhanced danger to society, requiring emphasis \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\non protection of the public, deterrence and denunciation:  R. v. Beauchamp, at para.260; R v. \\nMastop, 2013 BCCA 494 at para.46; Evans Dambrot at 140. \\n[55] There is no clear range of sentence for section 467.12 of the Criminal Code.  This reflects \\nthe fact that the underlying offence can vary.  It also reflects the fact that courts have taken different \\napproaches to sentencing for s.467.12, with some courts giving it the primary substantial sentence, \\nand other courts giving it the secondary sentence (see discussion in Gordon-Brown at para.47).  In \\nOntario, courts have tended to do what counsel suggest I do in this case:  sentence on the \\nunderlying predicate offences (fentanyl trafficking being the most serious in this case), and then \\nseparately on the criminal organization offence (as done in Evans, and the cases cited at para.121 \\nof the trial decision in Evans).  As noted, I agree with the approach suggested by counsel.  I view \\nthe criminal organization counts as a particularly aggravated form of the underlying offence of \\ntrafficking (similar to parallel provisions concerning firearms and terrorism, as discussed in the \\ntrial decision in Evans, at paras.104-120).  The criminal organization counts amplify the range of \\nthe underlying offences.   \\n[56] Once the range of sentence is determined for a particular offence, the sentencing court must \\nimpose a fit and proportionate sentence, bearing in mind the range of sentence, the gravity of the \\noffence and the degree of responsibility of the offender, as reflected by all the circumstances, \\nincluding relevant principles and objectives of sentencing, and aggravating and mitigating \\ncircumstances (aggravating factors increase the gravity of the offence or degree of responsibility \\nof the offender relative to others committing the same kind of offence; mitigating factors reduce \\nthe gravity of the offence or degree of responsibility of the offender relative to other offenders \\ncommitting the same kind of offence): s.718.1 of the Criminal Code; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9 at \\nparas. 34, 37-38, 96-97, and 108-114; R. v. M.V., 2023 ONCA 724 at paras.44-52. \\nPRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING \\n[57] The principles of sentencing are now largely codified (mainly in ss.718, 718.01-04, 71.1 of \\nthe Criminal Code), though the common law remains important.  At this point I will only note \\nsome of the most important principles; other relevant ones I will address in the course of my \\nanalysis.  As with any sentencing decision, the relative weight to be accorded to each sentencing \\nprinciple or objective will vary depending on the circumstances of the particular offence. In all \\ninstances, the sentence must be proportionate to both the gravity of the offence and the degree of \\nresponsibility of the offender.  \\n[58] Section 10(1) of the CDSA incorporates the principles set out in the Criminal Code, and \\nnotes that “the fundamental purpose of any sentence for an offence under this Part is to contribute \\nto the respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society while encouraging \\nrehabilitation, and treatment in appropriate circumstances, of offenders and acknowledging the \\nharm done to victims and to the community.”   \\n[59] Appellate courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada, have repeatedly recognized the \\n“significant if not staggering” harm caused by trafficking in hard drugs, directly to users, such as \\naddiction, health problems and death,  indirectly to their families and communities, including the \\n“inevitable” violence and crime associated with drug use, trafficking and importation, the \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\nintergenerational trauma, and the staggering cost to society in terms of health care and law \\nenforcement expenses, and lost productivity: R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC per Moldaver at paras.87-\\n92; Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, at \\npp. 1039-40; R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at p. 1053; R. v. Lukaniuk (1988), 34 O.A.C. 315 \\n(C.A).  Long before the fentanyl crises started to destroy our communities, the Supreme Court \\nnoted that trafficking in hard drugs “tears at the very fabric of society”.  These words have never \\nseemed more true than at the present time. \\n[60] Given the immense harm of drug trafficking, denunciation and deterrence are of paramount \\nimportance in the sentencing process.  As Lamer J. commented almost 40 years ago in Smith, at p. \\n123: \\nThose who import and market hard drugs for lucre are responsible for the gradual \\nbut inexorable degeneration of many of their fellow human beings as a result of \\ntheir becoming drug addicts. ... Such persons, with few exceptions ... should, upon \\nconviction, in my respectful view, be sentenced to and actually serve long periods \\nof penal servitude. \\n[61] In Parranto, the Brown/Martin majority noted that “Local conditions may enter into the \\nassessment of the gravity of the offence and militate in favour of prioritizing certain sentencing \\ngoals” (para.59).  The court went on to note that “the offender’s willingness to exploit at-risk \\npopulations” is an aggravating fact, increasing the seriousness of the offence and the moral \\nculpability of the offender (70-71): \\nWhile all people and places merit protection, sentencing judges may, as they consider \\nappropriate, give special consideration to the disproportionate harm caused to particularly \\nvulnerable groups and/or vulnerable and remote locations, where escaping traffickers is more \\ndifficult and resources for combating addiction are more sparse. \\nANALYSIS - WHAT IS A FIT SENTENCE IN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES? \\n[62] I will situate the trafficking in this case in the range, and then consider the aggravating \\ncircumstances, the mitigating circumstances, and circumstances that have a mitigating effect \\n(namely harsh conditions of pre-sentence custody).   \\n[63] Both counsel refer to the range for a mid-level trafficker as the relevant range.  I agree; the \\ndrug trafficking in this case falls at the mid-level.  Although the wires capture Mr. Bailey-Ricketts \\nconducting street-level trafficking, the evidence also shows that he arranged for the supply of drugs \\nnorth, bringing significant quantities north (during the April 21, 2020 stop near Barrie, Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts’s mules Victoria Ditmer and KG were carrying a total of 116.9 grams of cocaine and 73.5 \\ngrams of a fentanyl/heroin mix).  Earlier in March he advised Carlton Jones about the bus schedule, \\nand how to carry drugs north (“ball it”), and picked him up at the bus depot in Thunder Bay.  The \\nintercepts showed him forging connections with users in Thunder Bay, arranging for “trap” houses, \\nplaces to sell drugs out of, and places to stay.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts oversaw the sale of drugs in the \\ncommunity.  He advised Carlton Jones to keep the “trizzie” “low key”.  They discussed the pace \\nof sales; on one occasion he gave Mr. Jones a sort of pep talk, encouraging him that sales would \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\npick up as social assistance cheques were due out soon.  He directed Ms. Ditmer’s trafficking in \\nThunder Bay in his absence, telling her where to go, how much to bring and exactly what to do.  \\nWhen they struggled to keep up with the demand for fentanyl, he sternly rebuked Mr. Lopez-\\nValencia’s suggestion that they find a local supplier, sharply cautioning “not in my vicinities”.  \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts is at least a mid-level trafficker; a highly skilled one. \\n[64] The trafficking occurred persistently over the two-month period set out in the indictment \\n(March 6 to May 7, 2020).  When the wires went up in early March, 2020, it was apparent that Mr. \\nBailey-Ricketts’s Thunder Bay trafficking program was already in full swing:  he had established \\nclients, places to stay, places to sell drugs.  In a call to Mr. Charley on March 14, 2020, Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts noted “it’s not the same like when we’re here in January fam, I have like two…I have like \\nthree cribs we could like, trizzy out of right now”.  Supply was the issue.  In the same call, Mr. \\nBailey-Ricketts noted that they needed to “front some drugs from a man or rob a man for some \\ndrugs or one of the two dog.”  They also needed a “certified worker” to “mold” (Vol.III, item 14). \\n[65] The trafficking was well-organized and tightly controlled by Mr. Bailey-Ricketts.  He \\narranged for the supply of drugs (kept safe at his grandmother’s home on Lauder Avenue in EWC \\nterritory), arranged to bring it north using young or youthful people without criminal history \\n(Carlton Jones, Victoria Ditmer, KG), and arranged for the people and places to sell it.  He kept \\ntight control over his Thunder Bay drug trafficking “program”.  When Carlton Jones was late \\nbringing drugs north, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts mused to Mr. Charley that Mr. Jones better arrive soon \\notherwise there would be a body in the woods.  When Mr. Lopez Valencia discussed finding a \\nlocal sources for drugs, he issued a sharp rebuke:  “not in my vicinities”.   \\n[66] Section 10 (2)(c) of the CDSA explicitly notes that it is aggravating to use or involve “a \\nperson under the age of eighteen years…in the commission of the offence”.  As noted, KG and \\nVictoria Ditmer were carrying the drugs found during the police stop on April 21, 2020 near Barrie.  \\nThey were Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s drugs (as I explained in my reasons for judgment), picked up \\nfrom his grandmother’s home on Lauder Avenue.  KG was only 17 at the time.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts \\nknew KG had recently been kicked out of his parents’ home.  Ms. Ditmer was 18.  Mr. Charley \\nand Mr. Bailey-Ricketts repeatedly discussed needing new “youth” in their operation. \\n[67] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts deliberately targeted the vulnerable.  Thunder Bay has a notorious drug \\nproblem, including a disproportionately high share of opioid-related deaths as compared to other \\ncommunities, and the province as a whole (this is well-documented in the reports and local caselaw \\nprovided by the Crown).  Similar to an importer or producer, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts brought drugs \\ninto the vulnerable Thunder Bay community.  He targeted the community because of its demand \\nand the fact that he could sell for higher prices than in Toronto.  Detective Duffus, qualified as an \\nexpert in drug language and pricing and common weights, testified that street drugs like cocaine \\nand heroine/fentanyl command higher prices north of Toronto, the further north the higher the \\npremium. \\n[68] Inside the already vulnerable Thunder Bay “market” for cocaine and heroin/fentanyl, Mr. \\nBailey-Ricketts deliberately targeted and preyed on the particularly vulnerable.  When Carlton \\nJones complained that sales were slow, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts “encouraged” him by noting that social \\nsecurity cheques were due soon.  While the devastating effect of trafficking in serious drugs like \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\nfentanyl is already taken into account in the approximate range of sentence, in Parranto, the \\nBrown/Martin majority emphasized that it was open to a sentencing judge to “take into account \\nthe offender’s willingness to exploit at-risk populations and communities” as increasing “not only \\nthe gravity of the offence but the moral culpability of the offender”:  Parranto, para.70.   \\n[69] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts did not stop trafficking or even pause the Thunder Bay drug trafficking \\nprogram after he was arrested and charged with joint possession of the drugs found on April 21, \\n2020.  He was released on bail and went right back to “work” at his Thunder Bay drug program.  \\nIt was in full swing when he and Victoria Ditmer were arrested on May 7, 2020 on a delivery.  A \\ncutting agent was found in the stash house they had been using, and more drugs were found in the \\nhotel room they were selling out of. \\n[70] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts has a related criminal record.  Two of the three entries (the third is \\nimpaired driving) are drug related:  2009 for possession of a schedule I substance and a s.95 firearm \\n(a well-established “tool” of the drug trade); 2017 for trafficking in a schedule I substance.  There \\nare gaps in the record, but considered in the context of the evidence in this case, I do not believe \\nthe gaps suggest a break in criminal activity so much as Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s skill as a drug dealer.  \\nAccording to Mr. Bailey-Ricketts and the many friends and family interviewed by the PSR writer, \\napart from working at a fast food restaurant when he was a teenager, he has never held a formal \\njob.  He supported his grandmother, and was driving a BMW SUV (or rather being driven in a \\nBMW SUV by his teenage driver, Victoria Ditmer) at the time frame of the indictment.  In a candid \\nconversation with Ms. Ditmer on May 4, 2020, captured on a vehicle probe in the BMW, he mused \\nabout how he gave Jose Lopez-Valencia “80%” of Lopez-Valencia’s “whops” (drug deals), and \\nhow he had Crips living with him for years, teaching them “how this all work…these all my \\nunderlings….I had generations of little N******s that I put in there [a trap house]….I had little \\nN*****s come from here to my house and say yo OG” (Vol.IX, item 8). \\n[71] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts is not an addict trafficker.  Trafficking was his livelihood. \\n[72] Finally, it is well established that cocaine, heroin and fentanyl are extremely dangerous \\ndrugs.  Fentanyl has been described as “the worst of the worst”.  It is ravaging our communities, \\nin particular Thunder Bay, which currently has the highest opioid-related death rate of any \\ncommunity in Ontario. \\n[73] Turning to mitigating circumstances, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts has comparatively little to offer in \\nmitigation.   \\n[74] It is trite law that neither his decision to exercise his constitutional right to a trial, nor the \\nway his counsel chose to litigate that trial, can be considered as aggravating circumstances on \\nsentence:  R. v. Kozy, (1990), 80 C.R. (3d) 59.  I mention this, however, as it is important when \\nassessing the range case law.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts cannot claim the mitigating benefit of a guilty \\nplea, which is a significant factor in many of the range cases put before me.  \\n[75] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts has had a difficult childhood and upbringing, including suffering the \\neffects of anti-Black racism.  The Crown position takes this into account as a mitigating \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\ncircumstance.  I agree it is important and mitigating, but, for the following reasons, accord it little \\nweight in the circumstances of this case.   \\n[76] While I do not have an Impact of Race and Culture Assessment (IRCA) (it was taking too \\nlong), I have a very detailed PSR which includes extensive helpful information about Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts’s neighbourhood and the anti-Black racism he suffered growing up.  In addition, I take \\njudicial notice of anti-Black racism in our society, and counsel agree that I can consider the “Expert \\nReport on Crime, Criminal Justice and the Experience of Black Canadians in Toronto, Ontario”, \\nappended to the trial decision in R. v. Morris, 2018 ONSC 5186.   \\n[77] Background information about an offender, including how anti-Black racism has impacted \\nthe offender, is relevant to the sentencing process in two important ways.  First, background \\ninformation is important in understanding the offender’s moral blameworthiness or responsibility \\nfor the offence, something essential to arriving at a proportionate balance between the seriousness \\nof the offending conduct and the moral blameworthiness of the offender that is necessary to craft \\na fit sentence.  For example, it may be very helpful to understand an offender’s experience, \\nincluding with anti-Black racism, in assessing the moral blameworthiness of choices they make.  \\nSecond, background information assists in blending the various objectives of sentencing to arrive \\nat an appropriate sanction in the circumstances. \\n[78] There is no question that there is a connection between Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s background \\nand the offending behaviour in this case.  Racism, the absence of a positive male role model, the \\npresence of gangs in the neighbourhood, all go a good distance toward explaining how Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts became involved with the EWC and drug trafficking, and diminishing his moral \\nculpability.  In the particular circumstances of this case, however, where he has stayed involved in \\nthe EWC, and gone on to deliberately take advantage of vulnerable youth in his community, I \\ncannot give much weight to Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s background as a mitigating circumstance.  The \\nevidence of Mr. Bailey-Ricketts taking advantage of young people includes: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAdvising a much younger Carlton Jones how to bring drugs north (“ball it”) for use \\nin Mr. Bailey-Ricketts Thunder Bay drug operation. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing an 18 year old Victoria Ditmer to drive him, carry his drugs, and carry out \\ndrug transactions in Thunder Bay. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUsing a 17 year old KG to bring his drugs north, and take responsibility for those \\ndrugs when Mr. Bailey-Ricketts, Ms. Ditmer and KG were pulled over by police \\nand searched on April 21, 2020.  As noted, this was my factual finding at trial.  It \\nis confirmed by Ammaan Charley’s conversation with Mr. Belfon-Green (a fellow \\nEWC member) about how KG had to “hug” the charges, and protect Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts knew KG had been kicked out of his parents’ home \\nat the time Mr. Bailey-Ricketts used him to carry drugs north. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIn the car probe on May 4, 2020, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts and Ms. Ditmer discussed \\nhow “Fat Boy” (Jose Lopez-Valencia) was not giving Mr. Bailey-Ricketts the \\nrespect he deserved.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts noted how he gave Mr. Lopez-Valencia \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\n“80%” of his “whops” (drug deals).  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts also mused about how he \\nand a deceased colleague showed “these N****** how this all work”.   \\n[79] Nor can Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s difficult background justify placing greater weight on \\nrehabilitation or restraint in the circumstances of this case.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was arrested with \\nMs. Ditmer and KG on April 21, 2020 with a total of 73.5g of mixed fentanyl/heroin, and 116.9g \\nof cocaine.  They were all released on bail.  Mr. Bailey-Ricketts and Ms. Ditmer went right back \\nto “work” at their Thunder Bay drug program.  It was in full swing when they were arrested again \\non May 7, 2020.  Similar to R. v. Parranto (Mr. Parranto was Indigenous and had a long history \\nof drug use and addiction), these circumstances undercut emphasis on rehabilitation that Mr. \\nBailey-Ricketts’s background might otherwise support.  As the majority in Parranto explained at \\npara.80: \\nMr. Parranto’s background circumstances can be said to have played a part in \\nbringing him before the court. Against this must be weighed the reality that Mr. \\nParranto committed the second set of offences less than three months after being \\nreleased on bail for the first set of offences. This suggests that restorative justice \\nprinciples such as rehabilitation are less salient in this case compared to other \\nobjectives including protection of the public. \\n[80] Finally, the offences in this case are so serious that general deterrence and denunciation \\neclipse whatever diminution of moral responsibility, and increased emphasis on rehabilitation, Mr. \\nBailey- Rickets’ background provides:  R. v. Abdulee, 2023 ONCA 32 at para.40; R. v. Husbands, \\n2024 ONCA 155 at para.60.  The planned and deliberate importation and sale of lethal drugs into \\na vulnerable community and to a vulnerable population requires a significant sentence to give \\neffect to general deterrence and denunciation.   \\n[81] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts has support in the community.  As I have noted, his grandmother was in \\ncourt almost every day during the long trial, and continues to stand by him.  As does his spouse.  \\nHis children love and miss him. \\n[82] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts has no work history, nor any trade.  But he has taken programs in \\ncustody.  During the first date for sentencing submissions, I was told that he was “one assignment \\naway” from completing his GED.  On the second date for submissions, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts \\nconfirmed that he had completed that assignment.  I have no doubt that Mr. Bailey-Rickets has the \\nability to succeed in pro-social endeavours, should he choose.  His Thunder Bay drug trafficking \\nprogram demonstrates that he is a smart, hard-working, and charismatic “businessman”, albeit a \\nhighly manipulative and amoral one, at least at time of these offences.  \\n[83] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts has been in custody for a very long time, since May 7, 2020, almost the \\nentire duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.  It is well-establish that the pandemic caused custody \\nto be particularly hard for a variety of reasons, including:  greater risk of exposure in a communal \\nsetting; fear of exposure with very limited ability to control ones circumstances; limited visits and \\ncontacts with the outside world; very limited or no programing; and extensive lock-downs.  Mr. \\nBailey -Ricketts was subjected to lock-downs (partial and full) at all four of the institutions he has \\nbeen incarcerated pending sentence, as documented in the reports provided from each institution.  \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\nI summarize these as follows, noting the duration of custody at the institution in question, followed \\nby total lock-down days (including full and partial), and then breaking out the number of full lock-\\ndown days (or near full): \\n\\uf0b7 2 months at Thunder Bay Jail, 23 total lock-down days, 11 of which were full or \\nnearly full; \\n\\uf0b7 15 months plus a week and a day at Central North Correctional, 133 total lock-\\ndown days, 121 of which were full or nearly full; \\n\\uf0b7 6 months at the Toronto South Detention Centre, 98 total lock-down days, 14 of \\nwhich were full (I note that some of these full lock-down days were extremely \\nonerous, for example Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was in full lock-down for six straight \\ndays over the Christmas week of 2021 – December 24 to the 29, 2021);  \\n\\uf0b7 22 and a half months at the TEDC, 156 total lock down days, 13 of which were \\nfull. \\n[84] Counsel recognize that the Court of Appeal has directed that particularly harsh conditions of \\npre-trial custody should be considered as a mitigating circumstance, rather than accorded a specific \\nnumeric credit.  Nonetheless, in an effort to carefully and fully account for the particularly harsh \\nconditions of Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’ custody, much of which was during the pandemic, counsel \\njointly submit that it should be reflected in a deduction of 1 year and 7 months from the final \\nsentence.   \\n[85] I recognize the harsh conditions Mr. Bailey-Ricketts experienced as a significant mitigating \\ncircumstance, but I decline to place a number on this circumstance.  I am concerned that doing so \\nwill “skew” the calculation of the ultimate sentence, and permit this number to take on \\n“unwarranted significance” in the sentencing process, and result in the imposition of an unfit or \\ninappropriate sentence:  R. v. Marshall, 2021 ONCA 344 per Doherty JA at para.52; R. v. Menezes, \\n2023 ONCA 838 per the ACJO. \\n[86]   The Crown placed weight on Morris factors as a mitigating circumstance.  For the reasons \\nI explained, I do not place significant weight on Morris factors.  I do however place significant \\nweight on harsh conditions of pre-sentence custody as mitigating circumstances.  This takes me to \\na similar place as the Crown position. \\n[87] As noted above, general deterrence and denunciation are of paramount importance in \\nsentencing for organized, persistent trafficking of hard drugs.  \\n[88] The defence submits that a total sentence of 6 years should be imposed for the fentanyl \\ntrafficking and, like the Crown, all the other non-criminal organization counts should be \\nconcurrent.  While I agree with this general approach, 6 years is too low.  It is at the very bottom \\nof the range, or below the bottom, a place neither this offending behaviour nor this offender belong. \\n[89] In the circumstances of this case, I believe that the 8 year sentence requested by the Crown \\nfor trafficking in fentanyl is fit and appropriate.  But for the principle of totality, the sentence \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\nshould be significantly higher.  The trafficking in this case falls at the highest end of the mid-range \\nin terms of seriousness, based on the amounts trafficked, the persistence of the trafficking, and Mr. \\nBailey-Ricketts as the organizing force bringing hard drugs, including fentanyl, into a vulnerable \\ncommunity.  As noted, I agree with counsel that all the other non-criminal organization counts \\nshould be concurrent.  I have taken these other counts into consideration in analyzing the nature \\nof the fentanyl trafficking.  In addition, concurrent sentences are required to ensure that the total \\nsentence is fit and appropriate and not crushing.  \\n[90] Turning to the criminal organization counts, the defence asks for 2 years; the Crown 6.  I \\nagree with the Crown that 6 years is a fit and appropriate sentence for conspiracy to traffic in \\nassociation with or for the benefit of a criminal organization, and that the other criminal \\norganization counts should be concurrent.  As I noted above, the criminal organization counts \\nrepresent a particularly aggravated form of the underlying trafficking.  They amplify the \\nunderlying charge.   \\n[91] There can be no question that Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s association with a criminal organization \\nsignificantly aggravates or amplifies the underlying trafficking.  It is what enabled him to bring \\ndrugs into the vulnerable Thunder Bay community, effectively acting like an importer.  Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts’s association with the EWC meant that he had a safe place to store his drugs (his \\ngrandmother’s home on Lauder Avenue secure in EWC turf), and access to a steady supply of \\nloyal “youths” he could use as mules to bring his drugs north, man his “trap” houses in Thunder \\nBay, and sell his drugs.  The intercepts show that Carlton Jones and KG were associated with the \\nEWC, though at much lower levels.  When Carlton Jones was slow arriving in Thunder Bay with \\nMr. Bailey-Ricketts’s drugs, Mr. Bailey-Ricketts and Mr. Charley express relief that they never \\nlet Mr. Jones into “the inner circle”.   \\n[92] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts association with the EWC also permitted him to do the dangerous work \\nof drug trafficking more safely.  He could shield himself from potential liability by using young \\npeople, or younger people, recruited from the gang, to carry his drugs, set up and operate his trap \\nhouses, and sell his drugs.  He could operate in relative anonymity in Thunder Bay where the \\npolice did not know him, and did not have the resources to deal with a Toronto gang.  It took a \\nsophisticated, resource-intensive, wiretap project to catch Mr. Bailey-Ricketts.  The affidavit the \\nCrown filed at trial in support of its application to have 25 officers from Orillia, Barrie, Thunder \\nBay, and Vancouver testify remotely provides a sense at the magnitude of resources required to \\ncatch Mr. Bailey-Ricketts:  Affidavit of DC Brandon Polak of the Toronto Police Service, \\nIntelligence Unit, dated April 11, 2023, in support of authorization for remote testimony during \\nthe Defendant’s trial. \\n[93] In all of these circumstances, the total sentence requested by defence counsel of 6 years and \\n5 months (8 years minus 1 year and 7 months for Duncan credit for harsh conditions of pre-\\nsentence custody) strikes me as grossly unfit in the circumstances of this case.  This is brought into \\nsharp relief when compared with the sentence that Carlton Jones received on a guilty plea.  Mr. \\nJones was involved in a fraction of what Mr. Bailey-Ricketts was involved in, with far less moral \\nculpability.  He received a sentence of 7 years.  It would be perverse if Mr. Bailey-Ricketts, who \\nwas the operating mind behind the Thunder Bay drug trafficking program, with a long history of \\ndrug trafficking, received a sentence similar to Mr. Jones, particularly given that Mr. Jones pleaded \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\nguilty and had no criminal record.  Again, it is in no way aggravating that Mr. Bailey-Ricketts had \\na trial.  But Mr. Jones would have received significant mitigation as a result of his guilty plea, \\nmitigation that Mr. Bailey-Ricketts cannot claim. \\n[94] In contrast, the total sentence of 14 years requested by the Crown strikes me as a fit and \\nappropriate.  If anything, it is lenient.  The Crown position placed significant weight on Morris \\nfactors as a mitigating circumstance.  As I noted, I decline to place significant weight on Morris \\nfactors, but I do place significant weight on the harsh conditions of pre-sentence custody as a \\nmitigating circumstance.  Ultimately, I am satisfied that 13 years is a fit and appropriate sentence \\nin all the circumstances of this offence and this offender.  It will be broken down in the fashion \\nsuggested by counsel: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTrafficking in fentanyl between March 6 and May 7, 2020 (count 22) – 8 years; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTrafficking in cocaine between March 6 and May 7, 2020 (count 21) – 3 years \\nconcurrent to count 22; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPossession of fentanyl for the purpose of trafficking on April 21, 2010 (count 24) \\n– 6 years concurrent to count 22;  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPossession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking on April 21, 2020 (count 23) – \\n3 years concurrent to count 22; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPossession of the proceeds of crime on April 21, 2020 (count 25) – 2 years \\nconcurrent to count 22;  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPossession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking on May 7, 2020(count 26) – 3 \\nyears concurrent to count 22;  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPossession of the proceeds of crime on May 7, 2020 (count 27) – 2 years concurrent \\nto count 22;  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nConspiracy to traffic in association with a criminal organization between March 6 \\nand May 7 (count 19) - 5 years consecutive to count 22; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTrafficking in association with a criminal organization between March 6 and May \\n7 (count 18) – 5 years concurrent to count 19;  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nInstructing a person to commit the indictable offence of trafficking in association \\nwith a criminal organization between March 6 and May 7 (count 17) – 5 years \\nconcurrent to count 19. \\n[95] Mr. Bailey-Ricketts has been in custody continuously since his second arrest on May 7, \\n2020, a total period of 1421 days.  He is entitled to the statutory Summers credit of 1.5:1 days for \\nthis period.  Counsel jointly submit that this comes out to 70 months or 5 years and 10 months.  I \\naccept this submission as my numbers come out very close.  I will allocate this pre-sentence \\n2024 ONSC 1834 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\ncustody equally between the two lead sentences (i.e. 35 months on the trafficking in fentanyl, and \\n35 months on the conspiracy to traffic in schedule I substance in accordance with a criminal \\norganization). This leaves Mr. Bailey-Ricketts with 86 months or 7 years and 2 months left to \\nserve. \\n[96] Section 743.6(1.2) of the Criminal Code provides that (notwithstanding s.120 of the \\nCorrections and Conditional Release Act) where an offender is sentenced to two years or more for \\na terrorism offence or a criminal organization offence under ss.467.11, 467.111, 467.12 or 467.13 \\nthe court shall order that half of the criminal organization sentence (or 10 years whichever is \\ngreater) be served before the offender is released on full parole, unless “satisfied, having regard to \\nthe circumstances of the commission of the offence and the character and circumstances of the \\noffender” that denunciation and general and specific deterrence would be adequately served by a \\nperiod of parole ineligibility determined in accordance with the Corrections and Conditional \\nRelease Act.   \\n[97] In the circumstances of this offence and offender, I do not believe there is a proper basis to \\ndepart from the mandatory language of s.743.6(1.2).  I recognize that Mr. Bailey-Rickets has done \\nsome programming in custody, and has the support of family, nonetheless the circumstances of the \\noffence remain extremely serious, and his moral culpability remain extremely high.  Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts must serve half the sentence on the criminal organization count before being released on \\nfull parole. \\n[98] A s.109 order is mandatory.  This is Mr. Bailey-Ricketts’s second s.109 order thus it must \\nbe for life. \\n[99] Trafficking is a secondary designated offence for the purpose of the DNA databank.  There \\nis no objection to a DNA order, and, in the circumstances of this offence and this offender, I am \\nsatisfied that it is in the interests of justice to make a DNA order pursuant to s.487.051(3).   \\n[100] There will be a forfeiture order in relation to the proceeds and illegal substances seized on \\nApril 21, 2020 and May 7, 2020. \\n[101] The amended victim fine surcharge provisions were in place at the time of the offences in \\nthis case (the offences in this case post-date its coming into force on July 22, 2019).  Mr. Bailey-\\nRicketts was running a lucrative drug trafficking operation.  No reason has been suggested why \\nthere should not be a victim fine surcharge, but I am mindful of the fact that Mr. Bailey-Ricketts \\nhas been in custody for nearly four years.  He also has a family and three young children.  I make \\nit a nominal amount of $100.. \\n \\n \\nG.

EDWARDS, R.S.J.: \\n \\nOverview  \\n[1] \\nIt is a well published fact that the number of drug overdoses has been growing \\nexponentially in frequency.  The deputy chief pathologist for the Province of Ontario  \\ntestified in this trial that over the last few years approximately twenty percent of all cases \\nthat he sees for an autopsy are related to drug toxicity.  In this case the cause of death of an \\notherwise healthy 18-year-old Tyler Ginn (Tyler) was determined to be “combined fentanyl \\nand etizolam toxicity”.  Tyler was found by his father facedown on his bed in his bedroom \\nat around 9:00 a.m. on March 12, 2021.   \\n[2] \\nMr. Norn was arrested on March 19, 2021 and charged with a number of counts of \\npossession of a controlled substance; three counts of trafficking and one count of \\nmanslaughter.  Mr. Norn  pleaded guilty before me prior to this trial to one count of \\ntrafficking in fentanyl.  The issue before this court is whether the Crown has proven beyond \\na reasonable doubt that it was the fentanyl that Mr. Norn sold to Mr. Ginn that caused his \\ndeath.  There is also an issue as to whether or not a warning given by Mr. Norn to Mr. Ginn \\nnot to use too much fentanyl broke the chain of causation. \\nThe Facts \\n[3] \\nThere are a number of facts in this case that are not in dispute and in fact are agreed to.   \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n[4] \\nIt is admitted that Mr. Norn sold Tyler Ginn $20 worth of fentanyl on March 11, 2021 at \\napproximately 7:29 p.m.  Prior to the actual transaction, which took place outside of Tyler’s \\nfamily residence, there are a number of recorded text conversations between Tyler and Mr. \\nNorn.  These conversations begin at 6:59 p.m. and end at approximately 7:29 p.m.  A \\nreview of these text conversations, in my view, makes clear that Tyler was anxious to \\npurchase fentanyl from Mr. Norn.  Tyler paid Mr. Norn by e-transfer which is reflected as \\npart of the Agreed Statement of Fact. \\n[5] \\nThere is no dispute that Tyler’s girlfriend Serenity Storey (Serenity) arrived at the Ginn \\nresidence at approximately 6:51 p.m.  Video cameras outside the Ginn residence show \\nSerenity waiting to be allowed entry into the residence. She actually enters the residence  \\nat about 6:59 p.m.  \\n[6] \\nThe video cameras outside the Ginn residence show a vehicle pulling up outside the \\nresidence at approximately 7:30 p.m. The video shows someone leaving the Ginn \\nresidence; entering the vehicle and then returning to the residence at about 7:31 p.m.  It is \\nbeyond dispute that the person seen exiting the Ginn residence was in fact Tyler.  The \\ninescapable conclusion is that what is depicted on the video is the purchase and sale of the \\nfentanyl that resulted in Mr. Norn’s plea of guilty to trafficking in fentanyl. What Mr Norn \\ndisputes is whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the \\nfentanyl he sold to Tyler that caused Tyler’s death. \\n[7] \\nThe video cameras outside the Ginn residence also depict a period of time at about 8:21 \\np.m. when Tyler and Serenity are seen exiting the residence and entering into a van parked \\nin the driveway.  The video appears to depict Serenity and Tyler looking for something in \\nthe van.  At about 8:24 p.m. Tyler and Serenity leave the van and re-enter the house.  Tyler \\nis then seen at about 8:26 p.m. leaving the house alone; entering the van and then re-\\nentering the house at about 8:27 p.m.   \\n[8] \\nIt is also a fact that between 6:59 p.m. and 9:44 p.m. while Serenity was at the Ginn \\nresidence she was for the most part in Tyler’s bedroom.  Serenity left the residence at 9:44 \\np.m. as depicted in the outside video. She is seen carrying a box.  Serenity was the last \\nperson to see Tyler alive. Her evidence, which I accept, is that when she left Tyler he was \\nalive but not conscious likely due to his use of fentanyl. \\n[9] \\nAs a result of a search conducted of Tyler’s cellphone it is clear that Tyler was active on \\nhis cellphone.  Exhibit 16 is an Agreed Statement of Fact reflecting the investigative police \\nreport of Tyler’s cellphone the evening of March 11.  The report reflects the various \\nconversations between Tyler and Mr. Norn.  It also reflects two relatively brief telephone \\ncalls as well as various messages between Tyler and his grandmother.  The report also \\nreflects a relatively brief phone call and one email from Tyler to his employer.  Finally, the \\nreport reflects two email transfers from Tyler to Serenity. \\n[10] \\nThe evidence from the police extraction report of Tyler’s cellphone reflects that there were \\nno outgoing messages either email, text messages, phone calls or any other from of \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\ncommunication from Tyler after approximately 9:28 p.m.  There was however incoming \\nactivity that was not responded to by Tyler. \\n[11] \\nGiven the evidence from Serenity that Tyler was alive just before she left the residence and \\ngiven the lack of any outgoing activity on Tyler’s cell phone after 9:28 p.m. it is more \\nlikely than not that Tyler died shortly after Serenity left the residence.  I say this because \\nthe cell phone activity on Tyler’s phone shows incoming activity that Tyler never \\nresponded to.  The cell phone activity demonstrates Tyler was a person to respond to \\nincoming calls and texts. His lack of response after 9:28 p.m. leaves with me no doubt that \\nTyler passed away not long after Serenity left the residence. \\n[12] \\nWhen Tyler’s father Sheldon Ginn (Sheldon) went up to Tyler’s bedroom at approximately \\n9:00 a.m. on March 12 he was confronted with the obvious tragedy that his son Tyler was \\ndead.  Emergency personnel were dispatched to the residence. Various police officers who \\nattended the residence, as well as the scenes of crime officer  observed obvious drug \\nparaphernalia in the bathroom adjacent to Tyler’s bedroom.  Instructions were given to \\nseize the  drug paraphernalia which included four jars of what was suspected to be cannabis.  \\nSomewhat remarkably, the other drug paraphernalia including tin foil, a lighter, a propane \\nburner, and purple powder was not seized and remained in Tyler’s bathroom after the police \\nand all emergency personnel had left the residence. \\n[13] \\nSerenity first discovered that her boyfriend Tyler had passed away at approximately 1:36 \\np.m. on March 12.  Various text messages ensued between Serenity and Sheldon which \\nincluded a text message at 6:06 p.m. in which Serenity asked Sheldon if he had found any \\ntin foil and any “blue stuff”.  With the information supplied by Serenity, Sheldon \\ndiscovered the purple powder and put it into a Ziplock baggie which was eventually picked \\nup by the police a few days later. \\nPosition of the Defence \\n[14] \\nIt is conceded on behalf of Mr. Norn that there is no doubt that the trafficking of fentanyl \\nis an unlawful act and that the unlawful act is objectively dangerous.  The defence however \\nargues that the issue this court must determine is whether or not the Crown has established \\nfactual and legal causation beyond a reasonable doubt as between Mr. Norn’s unlawful act \\nand Tyler’s death and whether trafficking to a sophisticated drug user like Tyler with a \\nwarning constitutes an objectively dangerous act. \\n[15] \\nMr. Thorning on behalf of Mr. Norn argues that both Sheldon and Serenity are not credible \\nand reliable witnesses.  Mr. Thorning argues that the evidence of Sheldon and Serenity \\ndoes not establish that Tyler did not have access to or use other fentanyl on the night when \\nhe died. \\n[16] \\nAs it relates to the question of factual causation Mr. Thorning argues that the evidence of \\nthe toxicologist did not establish that the amount of fentanyl in Tyler’s blood was in the \\nfatal range due to post-mortem redistribution. In that regard Mr. Thorning points to the \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nevidence of the toxicologist who testified about the variability in post-mortem \\nredistribution which could have been below the range typically associated with fatalities. \\n[17] \\nFundamentally, it is argued on behalf of Mr. Norn that the Crown cannot prove beyond a \\nreasonable doubt that Mr. Norn’s actions caused the death of Mr. Ginn.  It is argued that \\nthere is insufficient evidence of factual causation that the fentanyl supplied by Mr. Norn \\nactually caused his death. It is also argued that Mr. Norn’s actions when he warned Tyler \\nagainst the dangers of using too much fentanyl functioned to eliminate his moral \\nresponsibility.    \\n[18] \\nIt is argued on behalf of Mr. Norn that there was abundant evidence at trial that raises a \\nreasonable doubt about whether Mr. Norn’s actions caused Mr. Ginn’s death.  While the \\nevidence of both Sheldon and Serenity establish that Tyler had a drug issue, Mr. Thorning \\nargues that neither Sheldon nor Serenity fully explored in their evidence the extent of \\nTyler’s drug problems.  The evidence extracted from Tyler’s cellphone is referenced in \\nsupport of the argument that Tyler was not only a significant drug user but also a drug \\ndealer.   \\n[19] \\nMr. Thorning also points to the video evidence which demonstrates that during the evening \\nof March 11,  Tyler is seen going to the family van on two occasions and as such it is \\nargued that Tyler had the opportunity to obtain other controlled substances.   \\n[20] \\nIt is argued on behalf of Mr. Norn that the evidence reflects that Tyler had a drug issue \\nwith Xanax - a drug also known as etizolam.  Mr. Thorning points to the fact that the cause \\nof death was a combination of both fentanyl and etizolam toxicity.  As such Mr. Thorning \\nargues that the opinion evidence does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Tyler \\ndied from a fentanyl overdose.   \\nPosition of the Crown \\n[21] \\nIn his argument Mr. Hill refers to evidence that is not in dispute.  Specifically, the fact that \\nMr. Norn sold Tyler $20 worth of fentanyl at approximately 7:29 p.m. on March 11 and \\nthat within 14 hours Tyler was dead.  There is no dispute that Tyler was in good health and \\nthat there were only two reasons established in evidence as to why Tyler died.  Specifically, \\nthat he had a toxic amount of fentanyl in his femoral blood. Etizolam was also detected  \\nbut the level of etizolam was not toxic.  Mr. Hill refers to Exhibit 15, the certificate of \\nanalysis that establishes that fentanyl was found in Tyler’s bedroom.  Mr. Hill \\nacknowledges that Serenity was a flawed witness but argues that fundamental parts of her \\nevidence were not shaken in cross-examination.  Specifically, he points to her evidence \\nwhere she testified that she specifically observed Tyler taking a hit of the fentanyl as well \\nas her observations as to how it affected him in a manner different from how his usage of \\nXanax would affect him.  \\n[22] \\nMr. Hill points to the evidence reflected in Exhibit 16 as well as the Agreed Statement of \\nFact, which clearly demonstrate that Tyler was anxious to purchase and to use the fentanyl \\nwhich he ultimately was successful in purchasing from Mr. Norn at 7:29 p.m.  Mr. Hill \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nargues that as a result of these various text messages the court can infer that Tyler did not \\nhave access to any other fentanyl as he was anxious to purchase the fentanyl that he \\npurchased from Mr. Norn. \\n[23] \\nMr. Hill acknowledges that the evidence establishes that Tyler did receive a phone call \\nfrom Mr. Norn and  that it was overheard by Serenity. In this phone call Mr. Norn told \\nTyler not to use too much of the fentanyl as he didn’t want anything to happen. More \\nimportantly Mr. Norn  did not want anything to “come back on him”.  Mr. Hill argues that \\nthis court can draw a number of inferences from this phone call.  The most important \\ninference is that Mr. Norn knew just how lethal the fentanyl was that he had sold to Tyler.  \\nIt is also argued that it can be inferred that Mr. Norn knew how desperate Tyler was to \\npurchase the fentanyl and that Tyler was the type of person who would in fact use it as \\nsoon as he purchased it. \\n[24] \\nIn dealing with the question of whether it was the fentanyl sold by Mr. Norn that killed \\nTyler, Mr. Hill argues that in fact the correct question this court should answer is whether \\nthe fentanyl sold by Mr. Norn was a significant contributing cause to Tyler’s death.  Mr. \\nHill argues that there is absolutely no evidence that Tyler purchased any other fentanyl.  \\nThis is further reflected in the cellphone records that demonstrate that Tyler was only \\ninterested in purchasing fentanyl from Mr. Norn.  \\n[25] \\nAs it relates to the argument raised on behalf of Mr. Norn that Tyler may have consumed \\nfentanyl when he used Xanax, Mr. Hill argues that there is no evidence of this so-called \\nphantom fentanyl and that the Crown does not have to prove a negative.  Fundamentally \\nMr. Hill argues that this argument amounts to nothing more than pure speculation. \\n[26] \\nAs it relates to the defence argument that Mr. Norn’s phone call warning Tyler of the \\ndanger of using too much fentanyl as breaking the chain of causation, Mr. Hill argues that \\nthis argument simply cannot succeed as fentanyl is a well-known and inherently dangerous \\ndrug.  Anyone participating in the trafficking of fentanyl is fundamentally involved in an \\ninherently dangerous enterprise. \\n[27] \\nAs it relates to other evidence concerning the tin foil and the straw, Mr. Hill argues that \\nthis evidence establishes that Tyler had asked Mr. Norn for these items; items which were \\nfound in Tyler’s bedroom. There is no evidence that the tin foil and straw came from any \\nother source other than Mr. Norn. \\nThe Expert Evidence \\n[28] \\nCara Shepherd is a toxicologist at the Centre of Forensic Sciences (CFS). She was qualified \\nas an expert in pharmacological toxicology.  Her expert report was marked as Exhibit 9.  A \\nblood and urine sample taken from Tyler was sent to the CFS for analysis.  Initially Tyler’s \\ndeath was  treated as a suspected drug overdose and Ms. Shepherd’s task was to conduct \\nan examination for drugs and alcohol.  Subsequently she was asked to reopen the case and \\nconduct a homicide analysis. \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n[29] \\nThe sample of blood upon which Ms. Shepherd conducted her examination was drawn \\nfrom Tyler’s femoral artery. The testing conducted involved tests for numerous drugs.  In \\nthe end result Ms. Shepherd’s testing revealed 6.9 ng/ml of fentanyl and 17 ng/ml of \\netizolam.  \\n[30] \\nThe level of fentanyl in Tyler’s blood is significant. The lowest fentanyl concentration \\nassociated with fatality is according to the evidence of Ms. Shepherd 3 ng/ml. As for the \\nlevel of etizolam Ms. Shepherd testified that 17 nanograms is a “therapeutic dose” \\nassociated with drowsiness.  She described this level of concentration as a “low dosage”. \\nSignificantly, Ms. Shepherd also testified that there have been no reliable reports of \\netizolam being associated with fatalities by itself. \\n[31] \\nIn cross-examination Ms. Shepherd conceded she could not quantify the amount of fentanyl \\nthat Tyler had consumed. She was also asked whether there had been any post-mortem \\nredistribution that could be associated with a rise in the level of fentanyl in Tyler’s blood \\nthat could account for the level of toxicity detected. Because she could not confirm that \\nthere might have been  some post-mortem redistribution she could not confirm that the \\namount of fentanyl in Tyler’s blood would be associated with fatality. \\n[32] \\nDr. Michael Pickup is the Deputy Chief Forensic pathologist with the Ministry of the \\nAttorney General (MAG). Dr Pickup was qualified as an expert in forensic pathology and \\ncause of death. Dr. Pickup conducted an autopsy on Tyler’s body that did  not involve an \\ninternal examination. Dr. Pickup determined that Tyler was an otherwise healthy 18 year \\nold who presented with no obvious evidence of injury or disease.  He testified however that \\nthere was clear evidence of fentanyl toxicity and etizolam. \\n[33] \\nIn coming to his ultimate conclusion Dr. Pickup testified in cross-examination that he took \\ninto the account the possibility of post-mortem distribution of drugs.  As for the level of \\ntoxicity associated with fentanyl and death Dr. Pickup testified that 3 ng/ml is the minimum \\nlevel based on the literature and that anything higher than this was sufficient for him to  \\nopine that Tyler had a toxic/lethal level of fentanyl in his blood. \\n[34] \\nAs for the findings of both etizolam and fentanyl in Tyler’s blood, Dr. Pickup confirmed \\nin his cross-examination that he could not rule out etizolam as the cause of death. More \\nsignificantly Dr. Pickup testified that both the fentanyl and the etizolam were the cause of \\ndeath. \\n[35] \\nI take from the evidence of Dr. Pickup that there were two reasons why Tyler died. The \\nfirst is he had a toxic/fatal level of fentanyl in his body.  The second is he also had a non-\\ntoxic level of etizolam in his body.  Based on the expert evidence it is safe to conclude that \\nthe level of etizolam increased the toxic effects of the fentanyl. \\n[36] \\nThe question this court then has to grapple with is whether the fentanyl sold to Tyler was \\nthe fentanyl that Tyler consumed and whether that fentanyl (assuming it was Mr. Norn’s \\nfentanyl) was a significant contributing cause of Tyler’s death. \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nAnalysis \\n \\nManslaughter – The Essential Elements \\n[37] \\nMr. Norn, as was his right, did not testify.  The onus is on the Crown to prove beyond a \\nreasonable doubt each of the essential elements of the charge of manslaughter.  The \\nessential elements that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt are as follows: \\n(a) \\nthat Mr. Norn caused Tyler’s death; \\n(b) \\nthat Tyler’s death was caused by an unlawful act; and \\n(c) \\nthat the unlawful act that caused Tyler’s death was objectively dangerous. \\nSee R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3 at paras. 72-28 and R. v. H.C., 2022 ONCA 409 at \\nparas. 33-34.   \\n[38] \\nIn this case the unlawful act, given Mr. Norn’s plea of guilty to trafficking fentanyl, was \\nthe sale of fentanyl to Tyler.  The central issue in this case is whether the sale of the fentanyl \\nby Mr. Norn to Tyler caused his death and whether the sale of the fentanyl was objectively \\ndangerous.  The defence argues that the act of trafficking in this case was not inherently \\ndangerous and that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the \\nfentanyl sold by Mr. Norn actually caused Tyler’s death.   \\n[39] \\nThe issues raised by both the Crown and defence require this court to consider both factual \\nand legal causation.  The Crown is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a nexus \\nbetween the sale of the fentanyl by Mr. Norn and Tyler’s death.   \\n[40] \\nThe issue of factual causation was reviewed recently by the Court of Appeal in R. v. H.C., \\n2022 ONCA 409 where at para. 38 Coroza J.A. stated: \\nFactual causation is whether but for the accused’s actions, the death \\nwould have occurred: see R. v. Nette, 2001 SCC 78. The accused’s \\nactions will have caused death when their actions are a “significant \\ncontributing cause of death” beyond a de minimis range: see Nette, \\nat para. 71; R. v. Smithers, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506, at p. 519. Factual \\ncausation focuses on the connection between the act of the accused \\nand the prohibited consequence, in a mechanical or physical \\nsense: Romano, at para. 26. \\n \\n[41] \\nAnother way to frame the issue as it relates to factual causation, is to ask how did Tyler \\ncome to his death from a medical, mechanical or physical sense i.e. but for the act of Mr. \\nNorn would Tyler have died: see R. v. Maybin, 2012 2 S.C.R. 30 at paras. 4 and 15; R. v. \\nH.C. at para. 52 and R. v. Brazier, 2023 ONSC 3191 at para. 153. \\n[42] \\nIn establishing factual causation the Crown must establish that Mr. Norn’s action in \\ntrafficking fentanyl to Tyler was a significant contributing cause of his death beyond the \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nde minimis range.  Stated in a different way, Mr. Norn’s act need not be the only cause of \\ndeath or even the direct cause of death.  It may be that his act would not have by itself \\ncaused Tyler’s death: see Maybin at paras. 114 and 120 ;  H.C. at paras. 38 and 52.   \\n[43] \\nThe issue of legal causation provides a limiting function which narrows a wider range of \\nfactual causes to those “which are sufficiently connected to a harm to warrant legal \\nresponsibility”.  It is concerned with the question of whether in this case, Mr. Norn is \\nmorally innocent and should not be punished.  The legal concepts of reasonable \\nforeseeability of harm and intentional independent act are engaged as part of the issue of \\nlegal causation: see Maybin at paras. 4, 5 and 16 and H.C. at para. 38. \\n[44] \\nAs it relates to the issue of reasonable foreseeability and independent intervening act the \\nCourt of Appeal in H.C. stated a para. 41: \\nThe court explained, at para. 28, that the principles of reasonable \\nforeseeability and independent intervening act are relevant but not \\ndispositive on the issue of causation: \\n \\n[W]hile such approaches may be helpful, they do not \\ncreate new tests that are dispositive. Neither an \\nunforeseeable intervening act nor an independent \\nintervening act is necessarily a sufficient condition \\nto break the chain of legal causation. Similarly, the fact \\nthat the intervening act was reasonably foreseeable, or \\nwas not an independent act, is not necessarily a sufficient \\ncondition to establish legal causation. Even in cases \\nwhere it is alleged that an intervening act has interrupted \\nthe chain of legal causation, the causation test articulated \\nin Smithers and confirmed in Nette remains the same: \\nWere the dangerous, unlawful acts of the accused a \\nsignificant contributing cause of the victim’s death? \\n \\n[45] \\nAs it relates to the issue of reasonable foreseeability this issue was also addressed by the \\nCourt of Appeal in H.C. at para. 42 as follows: \\nWith respect to reasonable foreseeability, the court in Maybin stated \\nas follows, at para. 30: \\n \\nAn intervening act that is reasonably foreseeable will \\nusually not break or rupture the chain of causation so as \\nto relieve the offender of legal responsibility for the \\nunintended result. This approach posits that an accused \\nwho undertakes a dangerous act, and in so doing \\ncontributes to a death, should bear the risk that other \\nforeseeable acts may intervene and contribute to that \\ndeath. Because the issue is whether the actions and \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nconsequences \\nwere \\nreasonably \\nforeseeable \\nprospectively, at the time of the accused’s objectively \\ndangerous and unlawful act, it accords with our notions \\nof moral accountability. This approach addresses the \\nquestion: Is it fair to attribute the resulting death to the \\ninitial actor? \\n \\n[46] \\nWhere an intervening act is alleged to have interrupted the chain of legal causation, the \\nquestion for the court’s determination still remains whether the dangerous unlawful act of \\nMr. Norn was a significant contributing cause of Tyler’s death: see H.C. at para. 46.  An \\nindependent or intervening act can only break the causal chain if they are so overwhelming \\nas to make the original unlawful act of the accused “merely part of the history” that leads \\nto the victim’s death.  The ultimate question remains whether at the time of death did the \\nMr. Norn’s  unlawful act continue to be a contributing cause of death: see Maybin at paras. \\n23 and 47 and H.C. at para. 46.   \\nAnalysis \\n[47] \\nMr. Norn disputes that the fentanyl that he sold Tyler was the fentanyl that actually caused \\nhis death.  It is argued that the evidence at trial establishes that there could have been other \\nsources of fentanyl available to Tyler that he used which ultimately caused his death.  There \\ncan be no dispute that the combination of fentanyl and etizolam was the cause of death.  \\nThe video evidence of Tyler and Serenity searching the inside of the van, it is argued, is \\nsuggestive of Tyler searching for drugs.  It is also argued that the evidence from Tyler’s \\ncell phone establishes that he was not only a drug user but also a drug dealer and had \\navailable to him other sources for his drugs other than Mr. Norn.   \\n[48] \\nAs it relates specifically to fentanyl, it is beyond dispute that it is a particularly dangerous \\ndrug and that anyone who traffics in fentanyl must know that there is a high risk of fatal \\noverdoes. The prevalence of fentanyl overdoses are reported in  the media on a daily basis. \\nAs Boswell J. noted in Brazier at para. 164 “those who traffic in fentanyl traffic in death.  \\nThey cannot be said to be morally innocent of the foreseeable consequences of so doing”. \\nI completely agree. \\n[49] \\nThe issue as framed by the defence is whether based on the evidence at trial it can be \\nestablished that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the fentanyl \\nsupplied by Mr. Norn that caused Tyler’s death.   \\n[50] \\nThe case for the Crown is largely based on circumstantial evidence. Mr. Norn however can \\nonly be convicted of manslaughter based on circumstantial evidence if I am satisfied the \\nonly reasonable conclusion drawn from the evidence taken as a whole establishes his guilt \\nbeyond a reasonable doubt see R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33 at para 32. \\n[51] \\nWhile the Crown may need to negative reasonable possibilities the Crown does not need \\nto negative every possible conjecture, no matter how irrational or fanciful, which might be \\nconsistent with the innocence of the accused. \"Other plausible theories\" or \"other \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nreasonable possibilities\" must be based on logic and experience applied to the evidence or \\nthe absence of evidence, not on speculation. Circumstantial evidence, viewed logically and \\nin light of human experience, may be reasonably capable of supporting an inference other \\nthan that the accused is guilty. Villaroman, at para. 38. To justify a conviction, \\nthe circumstantial evidence, assessed in light of human experience, should be such that it \\nexcludes any other reasonable alternative. Villaroman, at para. 39.  Alternative inferences \\nmust be reasonable, not just possible. Villaroman, at para. 42. \\n[52] \\nThe circumstantial evidence in this case is substantial.  It begins with the indisputable fact \\nthat Mr. Norn sold Tyler fentanyl.  It is also beyond doubt that a lethal dose of fentanyl \\ncombined with etizolam was the cause of Tyler’s death. As previously discussed the only \\nreal issue is whether it was the fentanyl sold by Mr. Norn to Tyler that was the cause of \\nTyler’s death.  Framed differently, does the evidence establish a reasonable doubt that \\nTyler had access to other fentanyl other than what he purchased from Mr. Norn and thus \\nleave open to this court to conclude that it was the “other” fentanyl that killed Tyler. \\n[53] \\nThere is very little evidence  that Tyler was a regular user of fentanyl.  His cell phone was \\nsearched by the police and the results of that search were entered into evidence as an \\nAgreed Statement of Fact - Exhibit 16. The results of that search would lead me to conclude  \\nTyler was a regular user and even a dealer in illicit drugs.   Nothing in Exhibit 16 establishes \\nthat Tyler was a regular user of fentanyl.  \\n[54] \\nThe text messages between Tyler and Mr. Norn between 7:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. \\nestablishes that Tyler was anxious to purchase fentanyl from Mr. Norn.  The text messages \\nmake clear that Tyler was keen to get access to fentanyl as soon as he possibly could. It is \\nnot an unfair inference to draw from these text messages that if Tyler had access to other \\nfentanyl other than what he was purchasing from Mr. Norn he would not have badgered \\nMr. Norn with numerous follow up texts enquiring where he was and when he would be \\narriving at his home. The text messages in my view establish that the only fentanyl \\navailable to Tyler the night of March 11 was the fentanyl sold by Mr. Norn. \\n[55] \\nMr. Thorning, on behalf of Mr. Norn, argues that the video evidence of Tyler and Serenity \\nentering the van around 8:20 p.m. establishes that he was looking for something. Mr \\nThorning asks the court to infer that Tyler was looking for fentanyl that he had hidden \\nsomewhere in the van. While I accept that Serenity can be best described as a flawed \\nwitness, I do not accept that her evidence is unreliable when she testified she has no idea \\nwhat Tyler was looking for when they got into the van.  \\n[56] \\nIf Tyler was in fact looking for another source of fentanyl in the van i.e. he had left some \\nin the van, it would not be an unfair suggestion that Tyler would have told Serenity that \\nthey were in the van to look for drugs .  Serenity testified she had no idea what they were \\nlooking for.  From her evidence in this regard I can only conclude Tyler never told her they \\nwere looking for drugs. \\n[57] \\nWhat is also significant in Tyler’s text messages to Mr. Norn are the requests that Tyler \\nmade for Mr. Norn to supply him not only with the fentanyl but also the means by which \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\nhe would be able to consume the drug - specifically a straw and tinfoil - both of which were \\nalso seen in the photographs of Tyler’s bathroom - see Exhibit 2, Photograph 73. If Tyler \\nwas a regular user of fentanyl it would not be an unfair inference to suggest he would have \\nready access to straws and tinfoil. In this case he did not - hence his request to Mr. Norm \\nto provide him with a straw and tinfoil. \\n[58] \\nThere can be no dispute on the evidence that Tyler was a user of non-prescription drugs.  \\nTyler’s father acknowledged in his evidence that to his knowledge, his son was using \\nXanax and may have experimented with other drugs.  In Serenity’s evidence it is clear that \\nTyler’s drug use extended to far more than just Xanax and included other drugs, including \\nacid, cocaine, mollies, oxycodone, marijuana, dabs and fentanyl.  To her knowledge, Tyler \\nnever used any illicit drugs using a syringe.  \\n[59] \\n In her evidence Serenity acknowledged that on one occasion the oxycodone they used  had \\nactually been fentanyl and that she had warned Tyler that they had been lied to.  Serenity \\nacknowledged that it was 100% possible that a drug could be sold as one thing and it turns \\nout to be something different.  This evidence underlies part of the defence argument that \\nthe fentanyl that killed Tyler could well have been fentanyl associated with the Xanax that \\nhe had taken that night. All of this  was acknowledged in the evidence of Serenity. \\n[60] \\nIn his written submissions and oral submission, Mr. Thorning points to the evidence that \\nTyler was a known drug user and that he had multiple ways in which he could access drugs.  \\nIt is also suggested that he had several drug dealers and that he had accessed drugs within  \\nhis own home.  \\n[61] \\nMr. Thorning points to the video evidence of Tyler getting into the van and retrieving \\nseveral items he suggests were put into his pockets that were never recovered after his \\ndeath.  Mr. Thorning argues that there is a “chance” that the drugs that Tyler overdosed on \\nwere not the drugs sold to him by Mr. Norn.  It is argued that many illicit drugs can be \\nlaced with fentanyl,  This is established in the evidence of Detective Paul McIntosh \\n(Exhibit 12, p. 45).  There is however, no evidence that the Xanax previously  sold to Tyler \\nwas in any way “laced with fentanyl”.  The evidence as to Tyler’s cause of death was a \\nfatal overdose of fentanyl and etizolam.  Tyler was a known user of Xanax (also known as \\netizolam) but there is no evidence that the Xanax that Tyler  had purchased was in any way \\nlaced with fentanyl.  The argument made by Mr. Norn in this regard is nothing more than \\nspeculation. \\n[62] \\nSerenity’s evidence is significant as it relates to her observations of Tyler using the fentanyl \\nin his washroom on one occasion on the evening of March 11.  She did not see Tyler use \\nthe fentanyl on the second occasion when he went into the bathroom.  The credibility of \\nSerenity’s evidence was called into question on many occasions during the course of her \\ncross-examination.  While there certainly were occasions where her evidence was not \\nconsistent with earlier statements to the police or her evidence at the preliminary hearing, \\nI fundamentally accept her evidence as it relates to her observations of Tyler the evening \\nof March 11.   \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\n[63] \\nIt would have been easy for Serenity to have embellished her evidence by testifying that \\nshe saw the second occasion when Tyler went into the bathroom and closed the door, \\nostensibly, for the purposes of using the fentanyl.  She did not do so.  She acknowledged \\nshe did not see Tyler use the fentanyl on the second occasion.  She only testified to her \\nobservations of Tyler after that second occasion when he went into the washroom.  The \\nfact that Serenity did not embellish her evidence to suggest she saw both occasions when \\nTyler went into the washroom adds to the credibility and reliability of her critical evidence \\nin this regard.   \\n[64] \\nSerenity observed how Tyler reacted to the use of Xanax. She also observed how he \\nresponded to what he was using behind the closed door of his washroom. She testified how \\nhe looked when she left him on his bed. He was breathing but not responding. His \\npresentation after he used what he did in the washroom is not consistent with his usual \\npresentation of using Xanax. The used tin foil and the analysis reflected in Exhibit 15 lead \\nme to the conclusion that Tyler used fentanyl that resulted in him unconscious on his bed \\nat approximately 9:45 p.m. \\n[65] \\nBoth the Crown and defence rely on the recent decision of Boswell J. in Brazier.  Brazier \\ninvolved a factual situation where the accused was convicted of manslaughter after \\nsupplying the deceased with fentanyl.  Boswell J. was called upon to deal with the \\npreliminary issue of factual and legal causation and specifically whether the Crown had \\nestablished that the fentanyl sold by the accused to the deceased was the fentanyl that the \\ndeceased had overdosed on.   \\n[66] \\nIt is argued on behalf of Mr. Norn that Brazier is distinguishable from the facts before this \\ncourt because on the evidence before Boswell J.  there was no evidence that the deceased \\nhad sources of drugs other than those from the accused.  In para. 75 of his reasons, Boswell \\nJ. noted that “the deceased was not reaching out to multiple sources” and that the deceased  \\nhad only just been released from a rehabilitation centre hours prior to his death.   \\n[67] \\nIn the case before this court it is argued on behalf of Mr. Norn that Tyler “had a supply of \\ndrugs within his own home” and as such, it is argued the other sources of illicit drugs \\navailable to Tyler may have been the cause of his death.   \\n[68] \\nCounsel for Mr. Norn refers to another decision of Boswell J. in R. v. Ali, 2020 ONSC 1719 \\nwhere the accused was charged with manslaughter in relation to the death of someone to \\nwhom he had provided drugs.  The deceased in that case had died of an overdoes after \\ntaking a mixture of heroin and fentanyl.  Boswell J. acquitted the accused in Ali as there \\nwas a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the drugs sold by the accused to the deceased \\nwere in fact the drugs that had killed him.  This is precisely the issue that is presented on \\nthe facts before this court.   \\n[69] \\nI accept that there is evidence that Tyler was a user of various controlled drugs other than \\nthe Xanax that was acknowledged by Tyler’s father.  There is, however, no evidence that \\nthere was a source of other drugs available to Tyler on the evening of March 11.  The \\nevidence of the state of his bathroom reveals evidence of drug paraphernalia.  The police \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\nseized four jars of what were believed to be cannabis   While it is remarkable that the police \\ndid not seize the purple powder, the tin foil, the straw and the blow torch, there is no \\nevidence of any other controlled drugs in Tyler’s bedroom or washroom or anywhere else \\nin the family residence.  To suggest Tyler had access to other drugs in his home is again \\nspeculation unsubstantiated by hard evidence. \\n[70] \\nIt is certainly open to the defence to argue that the police investigation is  open to criticism, \\nThe failure to see the powder, the tin foil, the straw and the blowtorch is remarkable. But \\nthere is no evidence of other drugs in the Ginn residence.  I am only left to speculate as to \\nwhether Tyler had stored drugs in the van and elsewhere in his home. \\n[71] \\nThe defence argues there were  other potential sources of controlled drugs that could  have \\nbeen laced with fentanyl that might have caused Tyler’s death.   The defence argues that \\nthe Crown has not disproved these other potential sources.  The Crown, in my view quite \\nrightly, argues that there is no obligation on the Crown other than to prove its case beyond \\na reasonable doubt.  There is no obligation on the Crown to disprove a negative.  \\n[72] \\nThe cause of death as testified to by Dr. Pickup was a combination of a toxic level of \\nfentanyl and etizolam. I accept this evidence. I also accept that there has been no known \\nfatality associated with etizolam but accept that the combination of the two drugs \\ncontributed to Tyler’s death.  The fentanyl that was found in Tyler’s femoral blood was the \\nfentanyl sold to Tyler by Mr Norn. But for the sale of that fentanyl Tyler would not have \\ndied. \\n[73] \\nWhile the Crown can not establish that it was exclusively the fentanyl that caused Tyler’s \\ndeath in my view based on the expert evidence the Crown has more than established that \\nthe fentanyl sold by Mr. Norn was a significant contributing cause of Tyler’s death - well \\nbeyond the de minimis range as per Nette at para 71. Mr. Norn knew he had sold Tyler a \\ndangerous drug. This is well established in the phone call from Mr. Norn to Tyler that was \\noverheard by Serenity. Mr. Norn’s phone call and warning amply demonstrates that in Mr. \\nNorn’s mind it was reasonably foreseeable that the use of the fentanyl could have deadly \\nconsequences. \\n[74] \\nIn my view, the circumstantial evidence in this case leaves this court with no reasonable \\ndoubt other than to reach the conclusion that Tyler was anxious to purchase fentanyl from \\nMr. Norn; that Tyler was anxious to use the fentanyl from Mr. Norn and that the only \\nsource of fentanyl that ultimately resulted in the overdose and his death, was the fentanyl \\nsupplied by Mr. Norn and that there is no reasonable doubt in that regard.   \\nMr. Norn’s Warning to Tyler – Factual and Legal Causation \\n[75] \\nWhile it is acknowledged that Mr. Norn trafficked the fentanyl to Tyler it is argued by Mr. \\nThorning that the chain of causation was broken when Mr. Norn contacted Tyler and \\nwarned him not to use too much fentanyl.   \\n[76] \\nThe evidence establishes that in fact, Mr. Norn did contact Tyler.  Serenity overheard a \\nconversation with an individual she identified as Mr. Norn.  She also testified that she saw \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\non Tyler’s phone screen “J. Norn”.  I accept Serenity’s evidence that she overheard Mr. \\nNorn tell Tyler “not to do a lot of the stuff” that he had given Tyler “as he didn’t want to \\nbe responsible for anything that happened”.  I also accept Serenity’s evidence that she heard \\nTyler tell Mr. Norn that he did not have to worry as nothing would happen.   \\n[77] \\nMr. Thorning argues that with this warning the chain of causation has been broken.  \\n[78] \\nThere is authority for the proposition that the voluntary consumption of drugs supplied by \\nan accused person may sever the chain of causation.  This legal reasoning  arises out of the \\ndecision of the House of Lords in R. v. Kennedy (No. 2), [2007] UKHL 38, [2008] 1 AC \\n269.   \\n[79] \\nIn Kennedy the accused had supplied the deceased person with a syringe of heroin.  The \\ndeceased injected the heroin into himself and later died as a result of alcohol and opiate \\nintoxication.  At trial the accused was convicted of manslaughter.  The House of Lords \\nacquitted.  The question before the House of Lords was: \\nWhen is it appropriate to find someone guilty of manslaughter where \\nthat person has been involved in the supply of Class A controlled \\ndrug, which is then freely and voluntarily self administered by the \\nperson to whom it was supplied, and the administration of the drug \\nthen causes his death? \\n \\n[80] \\nThe answer to the foresaid question as framed by the House of Lords is reflected in para. \\n25 of its reasons: \\nIn the case of a fully informed and responsible adult, never. \\n \\n[81] \\nThe reasoning behind the House of Lords’ decision apparently arises out of the Court of \\nAppeal’s decision in R. v. Dalby, [1982] 1 WLR 425 where the Court of Appeal stated: \\nA supply of drugs would itself have caused no harm unless the \\ndeceased had subsequently used the drugs in a form and quantity \\nwhich was dangerous. \\n \\n[82] \\nThe House of Lords in Kennedy ultimately determined that because the deceased had \\nvoluntarily injected himself with heroin knowing what it was, this was a full answer to any \\ncontention that the accused had “caused” the noxious substance to be administered to or \\ntaken by the deceased.   \\n[83] \\nThe legal reasoning from Kennedy if adopted here in Canada would essentially stand for \\nthe proposition that a drug dealer selling controlled drugs is immune from prosecution if \\nthe user voluntarily then consumes the drugs with fatal consequences. \\n[84] \\nWith few exceptions, Canadian courts have not followed the principles laid down by the \\nHouse of Lords in Kennedy.  In R. v. MacAllister, 2003 [O.J. No. 6075] it was successfully \\nargued that the voluntary consumption of a drug such as methadone by the deceased could \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nsever the chain of causation between the unlawful act and the death of the deceased.  \\nSimilarly, in R. v. Jackson, [2014] O.J. No. 3914 the court found that  the voluntary act of \\nan adult who chooses to ingest a lethal dosage of an illegal drug is an intentional and \\nindependent act which severs any causal link between the accused’s unlawful act of \\ntrafficking and the death of the deceased.  The House of Lords decision in Kennedy was \\nrelied upon by the court in arriving at that determination.   \\n[85] \\nA similar argument was advanced on a summary conviction appeal before Gordon J. in R. \\nv. Pheasant, 2013 ONSC 7138.  At para. 36 of his reasons, Gordon J. acknowledged the \\nfinding made in MacAllister that the voluntary consumption of a drug by the drug user  \\ncould sever the chain of causation between the unlawful act and the death of the user. \\nJustice Gordon however went on to state: \\n…Although that finding was made in MacAllister, and there may be \\nother factual circumstances in which voluntary consumption of a \\ndrug may sever the chain of causation, I would not accept this as a \\ngeneral principle. … \\n \\n[86] \\nThe Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Haas (CJ), 2016 MBCA 42 dealt with the argument \\nendorsed by the House of Lords in Kennedy and concluded Canadian jurisprudence on \\ncausation has developed differently from that in England.  In coming to this conclusion the \\nManitoba Court of Appeal relied on the leading cases on causation being Smithers v. R., \\n[1978] 1 S.C.R. 506 and R. v. Nette, 2001 SCC 78.  As it relates to the issue of intervening \\nacts, the Manitoba Court of Appeal referenced Maybin from the Supreme Court of Canada.   \\n[87] \\nCounsel for Mr. Norn argues that the warning that Mr. Norn gave to Tyler severed the \\nchain of causation.  In making this argument it is implicitly acknowledged on behalf of Mr. \\nNorn that he knew or must have known that the fentanyl that he had sold Tyler was \\ndangerous.  There could be no other reason for his phone call other than his concern that if \\nTyler took too much of the fentanyl it could potentially have dangerous, if not fatal, \\nconsequences.   \\n[88] \\nWhile I accept that there is judicial authority for the proposition that the chain of causation \\nis broken once the user of a controlled  drug voluntarily ingests a drug the governing law \\nin Canada is that reviewed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Haas and the Supreme \\nCourt of Canada in Maybin.  \\n[89] \\nThe question properly framed is whether the risk of harm caused when Tyler ingested the \\nfentanyl was reasonably foreseeable to Mr Norn when he committed the unlawful act of \\ntrafficking in fentanyl. As Karakatsanis J explained in Maybin  at para 30 “…an accused \\nwho undertakes a dangerous act, and in so doing contributes to a death, should bear the risk \\nthat other foreseeable acts may intervene and contribute to that death”.   \\n[90] \\nMr. Norn clearly understood the risk of serious harm to Tyler if he used too much fentanyl. \\nThere was no other reason for his phone call that evening .It was more than reasonably \\nforeseeable that a drug user like Tyler who clearly wanted to buy fentanyl and to then use \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\nit could use more of the fentanyl than was safe and thus cause a fatal result. The facts of \\nthis case do not establish an intervening cause that results in  a break in the chain of \\ncausation. \\n[91] \\nMr. Norn should be held criminally responsible for trafficking the fentanyl to Tyler and \\nthe subsequent consequences.  Punishing Mr. Norn would not result in a finding of \\nresponsibility for Tyler’s death as a result of something for which  Mr. Norn was morally \\ninnocent of.  Mr. Norn should be found legally accountable for Tyler’s death.  His warning, \\nin my view, does not amount to an intervening act that breaks the chain of causation. \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1836 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\n[92] \\nFor the reasons set forth above there will be a finding of guilt as it relates to the charge of \\nmanslaughter. \\n \\n \\nJustice M.L.

SMITH \\n \\n \\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT \\n \\n \\n1. Introduction \\n \\n[1] \\nThe plaintiffs, Gary, and Valentina Graf are married.  Ms. Graf works for the Region of \\nWaterloo.  Mr. Graf owned and operated a restaurant and hoped to purchase and run a second \\nrestaurant.  To that end, he made enquiries about, and eventually agreed to purchase, a restaurant \\ncalled Oscar’s, situated in Kitchener.  To fund that purchase, the plaintiffs listed for sale two \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nincome properties which they owned, a duplex and a triplex, one in Waterloo1 and one in \\nKitchener.2  They entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (“APS”) with the defendant \\nEaswara Periyathamby for the Waterloo property and with one Ramakrishnan Tharmalingam for \\nthe Kitchener property.  The APS for the Waterloo property was later amended to substitute the \\ndefendant Chitra Subramaniam for Mr. Tharmalingam. \\n[2] \\nOn the agreed upon closing dates both purchasers said that they were not able to close the \\ntransactions.  The plaintiffs then relisted the properties and they were successfully sold, the \\nKitchener property for more than the original APS price and the Waterloo property for less.  With \\nrespect to the Waterloo property, the Grafs claim damages comprised of the difference between \\nthe originally agreed upon purchase price and the price at which the property was eventually sold \\nplus lost transaction costs (legal fees, disbursements, and taxes), and that the deposit paid by Mr. \\nPeriyathamby should be forfeited and applied to those damages.  With respect to the Kitchener \\nproperty, they claim that the deposit paid be forfeited by Ms. Subramaniam. \\n[3] \\nDefault judgment was awarded against the defendant Via Realty Inc. on September 30, \\n2016, in the amount of the two deposits held by Via Realty on the two transactions.  At present, \\nby order of Justice Broad, dated March 14, 2018, both deposits are held by the Sheriff pending \\nfurther order of the court. \\n[4] \\nOne Waran Nathans, whom the Grafs say they understood to be the owner of Oscar’s and \\na real estate agent, acted both for the Grafs and for Ms. Subramaniam and Mr. Periyathamby on \\nthe failed agreements to sell the two income properties.  Mr. Nathans was the broker of record at \\nVia Realty.  He did not act on the later successful sales of the income properties. \\n[5] \\nBecause of the delays in the sale of the income properties, Mr. Graf’s agreement to \\npurchase Oscar’s did not close.  \\n[6] \\nImportantly, the plaintiffs claim that it was not until after the two income properties were \\nfinally sold and they had commenced this action that they came to understand that Mr. Nathans \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 241 Mary Street, Waterloo, Ontario, to which I will refer as the “Waterloo property.” \\n2 105-107 Waterloo Street, Kitchener, Ontario, to which I will refer as the “Kitchener property.” \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nwas not the owner of Oscar’s, that Mr. Periyathamby and Ms. Subramaniam (and Mr. \\nTharmalingam) were connected to each other through the defendant Mahesan Subramaniam, that \\nChitra Subramaniam was the wife of Mahesan Subramaniam, that Mr. Subramaniam was the true \\nowner of Oscar’s, that Mr. Periyathamby and Ms. Subramaniam were trustees or mere \\nrepresentatives or nominees of Mr. Subramaniam on the failed purchases, and that Mr. Nathans \\nand Mr. Subramaniam were in business together at Via Realty.3  Having come to know Mr. \\nSubramaniam’s role in this matter, the plaintiffs amended their statement of claim, added him as \\na defendant, and claim against him all the damages they have claimed from Mr. Periyathamby and \\nMs. Subramaniam. \\n[7] \\nThe plaintiffs claim would appear to be a straightforward matter of breaches of written \\ncontracts, but the defendants say that the written APS’s were supplemented by a verbal agreement \\npursuant to which the plaintiffs and Mr. Subramaniam agreed that if, for any reason, the \\nagreements to purchase the income properties failed, the plaintiffs would return the deposits paid \\nby Mr. Periyathamby and Ms. Subramaniam, Mr. Subramanian would return the deposit paid by \\nMr. Graf in connection with the agreement to purchase Oscar’s, and the parties would exchange \\nmutual releases on all three transactions.  As it happened, the mortgage financing for one of the \\npurchases of the two income properties was not approved.  Both deals did not close.  Accordingly, \\nMr. Subramaniam returned Mr. Graf’s deposit on the purchase of Oscar’s and was shocked to learn \\nthat the plaintiffs were refusing to return the deposits on the purchases of the income properties.   \\n[8] \\nOn the basis of the alleged verbal agreement, as well as an alleged misrepresentation in the \\nAPS for the Kitchener property, the defendants say that the plaintiffs are entitled to nothing. \\n[9] \\nFor the following reasons, I find for the plaintiffs.  The defendants launched a counterclaim \\nbut abandoned it at the outset of the trial.  It is dismissed. \\n                                                 \\n \\n3 The evidence establishes that Mr. Nathans and Mr. Subramaniam are very close and that they were partners \\nin, and the two directors of, the Via Realty business, where they were both reals estate brokers. Mr. Nathans \\nalso employed Mr. Subramaniam at a related company called Via Financial, where Mr. Subramaniam acts as \\na mortgage broker.  In addition, Mr. Nathans and Mr. Subramaniam together incorporated the numbered \\ncompany which later owned Oscar’s, but Mr. Nathans had left that business by the time of the events relevant \\nto this trial. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n \\n2. The evidence \\n \\n2.1 Introduction \\n[10] \\nAt trial, the evidence of the witnesses in-chief was received by affidavit followed by viva \\nvoce cross-examinations and re-examinations. I review here the chronology of events, highlighting \\nsome of the points of disagreement between the parties respecting the facts.  I draw my conclusions \\non the facts in part 3 of these reasons. \\n2.2 Mr. Graf expresses interest in purchasing Oscar’s \\n \\n \\n[11] \\nAs I have said, Mr. Graf operated a restaurant and hoped to purchase another.  He and Ms. \\nGraf were in the habit of having breakfast at Oscar’s on weekends and had become friendly with \\na server there, one Frances Adsett.  The plaintiffs say that Ms. Adsett told them on one of their \\nweekend visits to Oscar’s in May or June of 2014 that the restaurant was for sale.  They expressed \\nan interest in this information after which Mr. Nathans came to their table and introduced himself \\nas the owner of Oscar’s.  They had a brief conversation then and a tour of the restaurant was \\narranged for Mr. Graf for a few days later.  During that tour, Mr. Graf says he was very briefly \\nintroduced to Mr. Subramaniam, whom he understood to be Mr. Nathans’ partner in Oscar’s. \\n[12] \\nAt a meeting sometime after the tour, according to the plaintiffs, Mr. Nathans pushed them \\nfor an offer for Oscar’s and they told him that they had two income properties which they would \\nhave to sell first in order to fund the purchase of Oscar’s.  At this point, Mr. Nathans told the \\nplaintiffs that he was also a real estate agent and that he could list the properties for them.  The \\nplaintiffs provided Mr. Nathans with a credit report and with copies of the rental agreements for \\nthe then current tenants of the various units in the income properties.  Mr. Nathans also attended \\nthe income properties to inspect them. \\n[13] \\nMr. Subramaniam, Mr. Nathans and Ms. Adsett all dispute this version of the genesis of \\nthe relevant events.  Ms. Adsett deposed that she knew the Grafs as regular weekend customers of \\nOscar’s but that she did not disclose to them in June of 2014 (or ever) that the restaurant was for \\nsale, information she said she did not know until late 2015.  She said further in her affidavit that \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nMr. Subramaniam was the owner of Oscar’s at that time and the “he was the only one who used to \\nbe present [sic] at Oscar’s on a daily basis.”  Ms. Adsett was not cross-examined at trial.  Mr. \\nNathans said that he was not at Oscar’s on weekends. \\n[14] \\nMr. Subramaniam said that he was interested in selling Oscar’s in 2014 and that he listed \\nit for sale.  That listing attracted no offers and by the time he was approached by Mr Graf the \\nlisting had lapsed.  Mr. Subramaniam said that he understood that, after the lapse of the listing, a \\nmutual acquaintance in the restaurant industry, one Phillip Nellis, had advised Mr. Graf that \\nOscar’s was available.  Then, at some point in mid-May 2014, Mr. Graf came to Oscar’s and asked \\none of the staff if he could speak to the owner.  Mr. Subramaniam says that Mr. Nathans was \\n“never at Oscar’s to meet customers” and that it was he, Mr. Subramaniam, who came out from \\nthe kitchen and sat with Mr. Graf at one of the tables. \\n[15] \\nMr. Subramaniam says that he confirmed for Mr. Graf that the restaurant was for sale in a \\nmeeting that lasted about 20 – 30 minutes.  He said that he told Mr. Subramaniam that he would \\ncall “my realtor [Mr. Nathans] who had all the information about the restaurant” to arrange for a \\nmeeting between Mr. Graf and Mr. Nathans.  A few days later Mr. Nathans, Mr. Subramaniam \\nand Mr. Graf met as Oscar’s.  Mr. Graf was given a tour of the restaurant and he exchanged contact \\ninformation with Mr. Nathans.  A few days after that, Mr. Nathans told Mr. Subramaniam that the \\nplaintiffs needed to sell two income properties to fund the purchase of Oscar’s. \\n[16] \\nMr. Nathans corroborated the account of Mr. Subramaniam.  He added that before leaving \\ntheir meeting at Oscar’s, Mr. Graf asked Mr. Nathans for a copy of Oscar’s lease and financial \\ninformation about the restaurant.  Mr. Nathans said before the end of that month, May of 2014, he \\nmet with the plaintiffs at Mr. Graf’s restaurant at which time he supplied financial information \\nrespecting the numbered company that owned Oscar’s, which Mr. Graf had asked for.  A few days \\nafter that, Mr. Graf asked for a further meeting at which he said he was interested in purchasing \\nOscar’s but that he would have to sell two income properties first. Mr. Graf gave Mr. Nathans \\ninformation about the two properties, and, with Mr. Graf, Mr. Nathans visited both. \\n[17] \\nIn cross-examination, Mr. Graf agreed that he heard from Mr. Nellis that Oscar’s was for \\nsale, but otherwise denied the version of these events provided by the defendants.  He denied \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nhaving met Mr. Subramaniam twice and repeated that he had been introduced to him only briefly \\nduring his tour of Oscar’s, said that the first meeting at Oscar’s was with Mr. Nathans, and that \\nthere was never a meeting where all three of them discussed the possible purchase of Oscar’s.  \\nSimilarly, Ms. Graf denied the defendants’ evidence, maintained that she had never met Mr. \\nSubramaniam, and rejected the suggestion that she had confused the two men.  \\n2.3 The income properties are listed with Mr. Nathans \\n[18] \\nAs I have said, the plaintiffs say that Mr. Nathans told them that he was a real estate agent \\nand that he could list the income properties for sale for them.  They agreed to do so in June 2014 \\nand listed the Waterloo property for $479,900 and the Kitchener property for $474,900.  The \\nlistings made it clear that the two properties were not single-family residences.  Neither property \\nattracted any interest. \\n[19] \\nMr. Nathans said that he thought that the listing prices were high and that he told the \\nplaintiffs as much.  Mr. Graf insisted on these prices, however, because he was concerned about \\nhaving enough money to purchase Oscar’s.  Mr. Graf denies that Mr. Nathans gave this advice and \\nthat it was Mr. Nathans who proposed the list prices.  In any case, the properties remained on the \\nmarket for almost three months during which time they attracted not a single offer.  In early \\nSeptember 2014, Mr. Graf contacted Mr. Nathans and said that he thought that they should lower \\nthe list prices for the two properties.  They scheduled a meeting for September 5, 2014, to discuss \\nthe issue. \\n2.4 Buyers for the income properties emerge \\n[20] \\nMs. Graf testified that she was working at her job for the Region of Waterloo on September \\n5, 2014, and that the meeting with Mr. Nathans that day was during her lunch hour, the only time \\nat which she was able meet.  She testified that the plaintiffs knew in advance that “something was \\ncoming from” Mr. Nathans. \\n[21] \\nThe plaintiffs say that at the meeting on September 5, 2014, Mr. Nathans presented \\namended listing agreements for both properties and offers to purchase both at the amended prices.  \\nMr. Nathans was also acting for the prospective purchasers, Mr. Periyathamby and Mr. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nTharmalingam.  The offers were in the standard APS form of the Ontario Real Estate Association, \\nhad the same financing conditions (which had to be waived by September 12, 2014) and the same \\nclosing dates (October 15, 2014).  Deposits of $5,000 had been made in each case to Via Realty.  \\nThe plaintiffs accepted the offers immediately (Ms. Graf described the offers as “wonderful”).  \\nApparently unnoticed by the plaintiffs, both APS’s referred to the income properties as single-\\nfamily residences, which they are not. \\n[22] \\nAt the same meeting, with the offers accepted, Mr. Nathans presented Mr. Graf with a draft \\noffer to purchase Oscar’s from the numbered company which offer Mr. Graf signed.  The offer \\nincluded a financing condition (to be waived by October 6, 2014) and a closing date of October \\n31, 2014.  Mr. Graf provided a cash deposit of $5,000 to Mr. Nathans who then gave Mr. Graf a \\nhandwritten receipt dated September 5, 2014. \\n[23] \\nAll three APS’s contained standard entire agreement clauses. \\n[24] \\nThe plaintiffs say that they knew nothing about the identities of the two purchasers of their \\nincome properties and had no idea that they had any connection to Oscar’s.  As far as they were \\nconcerned, the only connections between the three transactions were that they, the plaintiffs, \\nneeded to sell the income properties in order for Mr. Graf to be able to purchase Oscar’s and that \\nMr. Nathans was the agent for both sides on all three deals. \\n2.5 A verbal agreement? \\n[25] \\nMr. Subramaniam and Mr. Nathans, however, tell a different story.  Mr. Nathans testified \\nthat there was a meeting on the morning of September 5, 2014, at which the plaintiffs agreed to \\nreduce the Waterloo property to a list price of $424,900 and the Kitchener property to $449,900.  \\nOn his way home from this meeting, according to Mr. Nathans, he called Mr. Subramaniam to tell \\nhim of the reductions. \\n[26] \\nMr. Subramaniam said that a few days after Mr. Graf’s tour of Oscar’s, Mr. Nathans told \\nhim that the plaintiffs had decided to list with Mr. Nathans and Via Realty.  Over the next few \\nmonths, he would ask Mr. Nathans for progress reports on the sale of the properties but that Mr. \\nNathans would tell him there was no interest in them.  On September 5, 2014, Mr. Nathans told \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nhim that he was to meet with the plaintiffs that morning to discuss reducing the asking prices of \\nthe two properties.  That same day, at around noon, Mr. Nathans called to tell him that he had met \\nwith the plaintiffs and that they had agreed to reduce the Waterloo property to a list price of \\n$424,900 and the Kitchener property to $449,900. \\n[27] \\nMr. Subramaniam said that at the time he heard from Mr. Nathans that the plaintiffs were \\nwilling to lower the listing prices for their income properties, he was anxious to sell Oscar’s.  He \\ndid not want to purchase any residential properties, but he wanted to sell the restaurant.  He decided \\nto call on friends to help.  He put it as follows in his affidavit: \\nI thought about the reduced prices.  I called two friends who knew I wanted to sell \\nthe Oscars.  I asked my friends, [Mr. Tharmalingam] and [Mr. Periyathamby] for \\ntheir help.  I requested them to act as buyers to purchase the two properties owned \\nby Gary and Valentina so that Gary and Valentina could get the required equity to \\npurchase the Oscars. \\n \\nBoth of my friends agreed to help.  I told them that if they suffered any losses, I \\nwould be responsible.  As they had been my friends for a long time, they trusted \\nme, and I trusted them.  They agreed to act as buyers. \\n \\n[28] \\nMr. Periyathamby confirmed that on September 5, 2014, he agreed “to act as a buyer for \\none of the properties” and that Mr. Subramaniam committed to “be responsible for any losses \\nrelated to the purchasing of the residential property.”  In cross-examination, Mr. Subramaniam \\nagreed with the suggestion that Mr. Periyathamby was doing him “a kindness” by buying the \\nproperty. \\n[29] \\nThereafter, Mr. Subramaniam says that he called Mr. Nathans at about 2:00 p.m. on \\nSeptember 5, 2014 and told him to convey an offer to the plaintiffs whereby (1) he would arrange \\nfor buyers for their income properties (at prices of $415,000 for the Waterloo property and \\n$440,000 for the Kitchener property) if Mr. Graf would agree to purchase Oscar’s (for $375,000) \\nand (2) if the agreements to purchase the income properties do not close for any reason the parties \\nwill exchange mutual releases and return the deposits without any deductions on all three \\nproperties.  Mr. Subramaniam says that Mr. Nathans told him he would contact the plaintiffs and \\ncall him back.  About an hour later, Mr. Nathans called back and said that the plaintiffs had \\naccepted all components of this verbal offer.  Mr. Nathans asked Mr. Subramaniam for the names \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nof the purchasers of the income properties, which Mr. Subramaniam provided, and Mr. Nathans \\nthen prepared standard form APS’s for each of the three transactions. \\n[30] \\nThat same day, according to Mr. Subramaniam, Mr. Tharmalingam signed the APS for the \\nKitchener property in Mr. Nathans’ office and Mr. Subramaniam took the draft APS for the \\nWaterloo property to the home of Mr. Periyathamby for his signature.  Mr. Subramaniam was \\nadvised by Mr. Nathans that on the following day, September 6, 2014, the plaintiffs both signed \\nthe APS’s for the income properties and that Mr. Graf signed the APS for Oscar’s, all based on the \\nverbal agreement as described in the previous paragraph.  No lawyers were involved at this stage.  \\nMr. Subramaniam said that he fully intended that all three transactions would close but that all \\nparties “knew full well” that if either of the income property deals did not close, Mr. Graf would \\nnot have enough money to purchase Oscar’s.  Mr. Nathans’ version of these events conforms with \\nthat of Mr. Subramaniam. \\n[31] \\nThe plaintiffs deny that there was any agreement between the parties except as captured in \\nthe three written APS’s.  They say that there was only one meeting on September 5, 2014, and no \\nmeeting at all on September 6, 2014. \\n2.6 The parties engage solicitors and work towards closing \\n[32] \\nThe plaintiffs hired Paul Settimi to act as their solicitor on all three transactions and he \\nopened three separate files.  He said that the purchasers for the two income properties both retained \\nShalini Sathya to act as their solicitor.  He did not find this unusual because they had a common \\nreal estate agent, Mr. Nathans, and that it is common for real estate agents to refer their clients to \\nlawyers with whom they have a relationship.  Mr. Settimi noted that a different lawyer, Gary \\nAnandasangaree, had been retained to act for the numbered company which was the seller of \\nOscar’s. \\n[33] \\nOn September 10, 2014, the plaintiffs agreed to an amendment to the APS for the Kitchener \\nproperty by which it was agreed that the purchaser would assume the then current tenants of that \\nproperty.  Mr. Graf continued to evaluate Oscar’s and hired an accountant to help him review \\nOscar’s financial records, which had been provided by Mr. Nathans. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\n \\n[34] \\nOn September 12, 2014, both purchasers of the income properties waived their financing \\nconditions.  Mr. Graf never waived the financing condition in his favour on the Oscar’s APS, \\nwhich condition expired on October 6, 2014. \\n[35] \\nOn October 6, 2014, Mr. Nathans asked the plaintiffs to agree to amend the APS for the \\nKitchener property by replacing Mr. Tharmalingam with Ms. Subramaniam, and to amend the APS \\nfor the Waterloo property by changing the closing date to October 30, 2014.  The plaintiffs agreed, \\nsigned the amended documents, copies of which they forwarded to Mr. Settimi. The plaintiffs say \\nthat they had no knowledge of any connections between Ms. Subramaniam, Mr. Periyathamby, \\nMr. Tharmalingam and Oscar’s.  Mr. Settimi said that it was unusual that these amendments \\n(including the September 10, 2014, amendment respecting the tenants at the Kitchener property) \\nwere presented and agreed to without the involvement of the solicitors on either side.  Ms. Sathya \\nsaid that she did not even become aware of the September 10 amendment until after the Kitchener \\ntransaction failed to close. \\n[36] \\nOn the date set for the closing of the Kitchener property, October 15, 2014, through her \\nsolicitor, Ms. Sathya, Ms. Subramaniam requested that the closing date be changed to October 20, \\n2014.  Mr. Nathans had advised the plaintiffs that the purchaser was having difficulty securing \\ninsurance for the property, and they agreed to the request through Mr. Settimi.  The plaintiffs say \\nthat at this time Mr. Nathans pressured Mr. Graf to sign a document saying that the Kitchener \\nproperty was a single-family residential unit.  He refused.  Mr. Nathans denied that he made this \\nrequest. \\n[37] \\nOn October 20, 2014, a further extension of the closing date (to October 29) was requested \\nand again the plaintiffs agreed.  Ms. Subramaniam requested and was provided access to inspect \\nthe Kitchener property on October 22, 2014. \\n[38] \\nOn October 21, 2014, Mr. Settimi received a letter from a solicitor named Rishi Vaid, who \\nadvised that he would be acting for Mr. Periyathamby on the purchase of the Waterloo property.  \\nMs. Sathya testified that she did not know why Mr. Periyathamby changed lawyers, but the change \\npost-dated her discussion with Mr. Periyathamby about the fact that the property was not a single-\\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\nfamily residence as reflected in the APS.  Mr. Periathamby said that he never spoke to Ms. Sathya \\nor to Mr. Vaid, and that the lawyers were arranged for him by Mr. Subramaniam.  He said that he \\nnever provided any instructions to either lawyer. He gave no evidence about why his solicitor \\nchanged from Ms. Sathya to Mr. Vaid. \\n[39] \\nThereafter, in the days leading to the closing dates, Mr. Settimi heard nothing from either \\nMs. Sathya or Mr. Vaid.  Accordingly, on October 27, 2014, he wrote to Mr. Vaid but received no \\nresponse.  On that same day, he came to understand that the purchaser of the Kitchener property \\nwas having difficulty with financing. \\n[40] \\nMr. Settimi said that at no time did anyone, including both his clients and the solicitors \\ninvolved on the transactions, ever advise him that there was any connection between agreements \\nto purchase the Kitchener property, the Waterloo property, and Oscar’s. \\n[41] \\nMr. Subramaniam said that he instructed Mr. Nathans to waive the financing conditions on \\nthe purchase of the income properties because he knew that his verbal agreement with the plaintiffs \\nmeant that if either deal failed to close the parties would execute mutual releases and deposits \\nwould be returned.  For the same reason, he was comfortable substituting his wife, Ms. \\nSubramaniam, for Mr. Tharmalingam when Mr. Tharmalingam asked that his name be removed \\nas the buyer of the Kitchener property.4  Mr. Nathans provided similar evidence.  He added that \\nMr. Settimi was not involved in the amendments to the APS’s because the “parties had a verbal \\nagreement for the three properties, and they cooperated with each other.” \\n2.7 The deals fail \\n[42] \\nOn October 28, 2014, Ms. Sathya wrote to Mr. Settimi to advise that her client, Ms. \\nSubramaniam (the intended purchaser of the Kitchener Property), would be unable to close on the \\npurchase of the Kitchener property.  Ms. Sathya wrote as follows: \\nOur client has advised that their mortgage provider has deemed the above noted \\nproperty a rooming house and has declined funding.  It is our understanding that an \\n                                                 \\n \\n4 There was no evidence about why Mr. Tharmalingam no longer wanted to act as a buyer for Mr. \\nSubramaniam. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nappraiser from the bank attended at the property to complete final inspections and \\nwas not satisfied with the use of the property.  The Vendor failed to disclose these \\nfacts to our client.  Given the circumstances, our client is not willing to complete \\nclosing and has requested for [sic] a return of their deposit. \\n[43] \\nMr. Settimi responded the same day, pointing out that the relevant documents, signed by \\nMs. Sathya’s client, made it plain that the property was a “multi-use residential rental property.”  \\nTherefore, he wrote, Ms. Subramaniam’s failure to secure financing “has nothing to do with our \\nclients and is not sufficient for cancelling this transaction.”  Mr. Settimi further wrote that the \\nplaintiffs were ready, willing and able to close, and that they would pursue a claim should they \\nsuffer any damages due to Ms. Subramaniam’s failure to close.  Ms. Sathya did not respond to this \\nletter. \\n[44] \\nAlso on October 28, 2014, Mr. Vaid wrote to Mr. Settimi respecting the Waterloo property, \\nadvising simply, and without explanation, as follows: “Please be advised that the above-noted \\ntransaction is cancelled.”  As he did with Mr. Sathya, Mr. Settimi wrote to Mr. Vaid (solicitor for \\nMr. Periyathamby), and advised that his clients were ready, willing and able to close and that the \\nplaintiffs would pursue a claim for damages.  Mr. Vaid did not respond. \\n[45] \\nOn October 29, 2014, Mr. Nathans contacted the plaintiffs and advised that neither of the \\npurchasers would be able to close on the agreements to purchase the income properties.  That same \\nday, by email, he sent mutual releases signed by Ms. Subramaniam and Mr. Periyathamby on \\nOctober 28, 2014.  The plaintiffs refused to sign the releases and forwarded them to Mr. Settimi.  \\n[46] \\nOn October 31, 2014, Mr. Nathans wrote to Mr. Settimi and asked that mutual releases be \\nsigned on all three transactions.  Mr. Settimi declined and, in the email exchange which followed, \\nMr. Nathans wrote as follows: “… you will hear from [Mr. Subramaniam’s] lawyer regards all \\nproperties, and all 3 deals are interlinked, sellers and buyers are well aware about it.”  Mr. Settimi \\nsaid that this was the first time anyone had suggested to him that the three transactions were \\nconnected.  None of the three lawyers he was dealing with had said anything about such a \\nconnection.  Neither did his clients or Mr. Nathans.  The only connection he was aware of was that \\nMr. Nathans was the agent on all three deals.  Nothing in any of the documents suggested such a \\nconnection.  No-one told him that Mr. Tharmalingam, Ms. Subramaniam and Mr. Periyathamby \\nwere trustees for Mr. Subramaniam, or otherwise not the true buyers of the income properties. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\n[47] \\nMr. Settimi closed the email exchange of October 31 by writing to Mr. Nathans and \\ndemanding that Via Realty not release the deposits on the real estate transactions, advising again \\nthat the plaintiffs would be commencing an action in connection with the failure of the purchasers \\nof their income properties to close, and demanding the return of the deposit paid on Mr. Graf’s \\nfailed attempt to purchase Oscar’s.  \\n[48] \\nMs. Sathya testified that there was nothing in her file respecting any trust agreements on \\neither of the income property transactions, nothing indicating anything about any verbal agreement \\nrespecting the transactions, nothing linking the two income property transactions such that if one \\ndid not close, they both would not close, nor anything linking either transaction to an agreement \\nto purchase a restaurant. \\n[49] \\nAt trial, Mr. Subramaniam said that he had hired a mortgage broker to secure financing for \\nthe purchases of the plaintiffs’ income properties.  The broker told him that the lender had asked \\nfor an inspection by an appraiser of the Kitchener property.  That inspection was arranged through \\nMr. Nathans and Mr. Graf.  After the inspection (which was on October 22, 2014), the appraiser \\ntold the mortgage broker, who told Mr. Subramaniam, that the property was not a single-family \\nresidence, as reflected on the APS.  It was also reported that the appraiser had been unable to visit \\nall the units in the property.  This resulted in “challenges in the final approval/release of the \\nfinancing” for the Kitchener property.  Although Mr. Subramaniam continued to work with the \\nbroker to resolve the problem, the lender decided not to fund the purchase because the property \\nwas a “multi-residential/rooming house.” \\n[50] \\nMr. Subramaniam says that he told Mr. Nathans on October 28, 2014, that the purchase of \\nthe Kitchener property could not close.  All parties understood that Mr. Graf would have \\ninsufficient funds to purchase Oscar’s, and that, pursuant to their verbal agreement, mutual releases \\nfor all three transactions would be exchanged and deposits returned. He acknowledged that the \\ntransaction for the Waterloo property could have closed (as did the proposed purchaser of that \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\nproperty, Mr. Periyathamby5), but said that he asked Mr. Nathans to send mutual releases for both \\ntransactions, signed by his wife and by Mr. Periyathamby, to the plaintiffs.  Shortly thereafter, a \\nmutual release and Mr. Graf’s deposit for the Oscar’s transaction were delivered to the plaintiffs’ \\nsolicitor. \\n[51] \\nMr. Subramaniam says that he was “shocked” when the plaintiff’s refused to sign the \\nreleases and return the deposits on the income property transactions “in breach of the Verbal \\nAgreement.”  Mr. Nathans claimed to be “shocked” when he received Mr. Settimi’s letter of \\nOctober 31, 2014, given its “utter disregard of the Verbal Agreement.” \\n[52] \\nThe plaintiffs say that it is true that Mr. Graf would not have had enough money to purchase \\nOscar’s if either of both of the income property transactions did not close, but that there was never \\nany agreement that if one of the three deals failed that all three deals would necessarily fail.  He \\nintended to purchase a restaurant and, whether or not that restaurant was Oscar’s, he needed to sell \\nthe income properties to achieve that goal.  I note that Mr. Graf did later purchase a different \\nrestaurant, after the income properties were sold to other purchasers.  \\n2.8 The aftermath \\n[53] \\nUpon the collapse of the deals to sell the two income properties, the plaintiffs listed them \\nfor sale again.  The Kitchener property sold for $10,000 more than the price to which the plaintiffs \\nand Ms. Subramaniam had agreed, which was the price at which it was re-listed with a new real \\nestate agent.  The Waterloo property sold for $73,500 less that the price to which the plaintiffs and \\nMr. Periathamby had agreed ($415,000).  It was initially re-listed at $410,000 but attracted no \\nbuyer for over 4 months, at which point the listing price was reduced to $341,500, which is the \\nprice at which it sold over a month after the reduction. \\n[54] \\nThe plaintiffs then commenced this action by way of a statement of claim that did not name \\nMr. Subramaniam.  He was added as a party later, after discoveries when they learned of his \\n                                                 \\n \\n5 I note that during his discovery Mr. Periyathamby said that the transaction did not close only because \\n“plaintiff Graf precluded the agreement on October 29th.”  At trial, he said that he did not remember using \\nthese words at the discovery. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nconnection to Mr. Nathans, Ms. Subramaniam, Mr. Peryiathamby and Mr. Tharmalingam, and his \\npreviously hidden role in the failed purchases of the income properties. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3. Findings of fact \\n \\n3.1 Introduction \\n \\n[55] \\nAs I have said, I find for the plaintiffs in this matter.  They have offered a coherent and \\nstraightforward account of the relevant events that is supported by the documentary record.  This \\nwas a case of three legally unconnected transactions documented in three separate APs which do \\nnot refer to each other.  There was no additional verbal agreement.  Two of the transactions failed \\nbecause the purchasers were unable or chose not to close.  The plaintiffs are entitled to damages \\nincurred as a result. \\n[56] \\nBy contrast, the defendants offer a strained version of events that is incredible and is not \\nsupported by the documentary record. \\n[57] \\nI come to these conclusions based on the following analysis of the evidence, and my \\ndiscussion of the application of the facts to the relevant law at part 4 of these reasons. \\n3.2 Did the plaintiffs deal with Mr. Subramaniam? \\n[58] \\nWhile the competing versions of the genesis of the relevant events are not very different, \\nand while both accounts suffer from the passage of nearly a decade since the relevant events, some \\nof the differences are important.  The plaintiffs say that they never discussed the sale of Oscar’s \\nwith Mr. Subramaniam, its owner, and that they understood Mr. Nathans to be an owner of Oscar’s.  \\nThe defendants say that the plaintiffs’ evidence that they learned from Ms. Adsett that the \\nrestaurant was for sale, when in fact Mr. Graf learned that fact from Mr. Nellis, and the evidence \\nthat Mr. Nathans did not attend Oscar’s on weekends, establishes that the plaintiffs have no \\ncredibility.  In their written submissions, the defendants argue that these inaccuracies suggest that \\nthe plaintiffs’ evidence cannot be believed on any point. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\n[59] \\nIn my view, the discrepancies in the evidence about how the plaintiffs learned that Oscar’s \\nwas for sale is of little significance and is most likely attributable to the passage of time and the \\nfrailties of human memory.  I certainly do not draw the conclusion that the plaintiffs were being \\ndishonest about this point.  In any case, the more important point is whether the plaintiffs met and \\nhad any substantive discussions with Mr. Subramaniam in this period.  Both plaintiffs were \\nadamant that they had not.  Both understood that Mr. Nathans was an owner of Oscar’s.  Even Mr. \\nSubramaniam’s wife thought that Mr. Nathans was an owner of Oscar’s.  Moreover, even on Mr. \\nSubramaniam’s evidence, immediately after being approached by Mr. Graf, he effectively \\nimmediately turned the matter of the negotiation of the sale of Oscar’s over to Mr. Nathans and it \\nwas from Mr. Nathans that Mr. Graf sought and received financial information about Oscar’s. \\n[60] \\nIn other words, it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to believe that they were dealing with \\nan owner of Oscar’s.  I believe the plaintiffs when they say that they did not have any substantive \\ndiscussion at any time with Mr. Subramaniam, and that all such discussions were with Mr. \\nNathans.  This conclusion is supported by the fact that when this action commenced, the plaintiffs \\ndid not name Mr. Subramaniam as a defendant.  He was not added as a defendant until after the \\nplaintiffs’ discoveries of Ms. Subramaniam and Mr. Periyathamby during which they learned of \\nMr. Subramaniam’s role in this matter. \\n[61] \\nIt follows that I do not accept the defendants’ submission that this body of evidence \\ndemonstrates the plaintiffs’ incredibility and/or unreliability.  On the contrary, as will become \\nclear, I accept that the plaintiff’s testified truthfully before me.  It is the defendants whose evidence \\nlacks credibility. \\n3.3 Did the plaintiffs meet with Mr. Nathans on both September 5 and 6, 2014?  \\n \\n \\n[62] \\nThe plaintiffs say that there was one meeting with Mr. Nathans on September 5, 2014, at \\nwhich he presented three separate APS’s which they signed at that meeting. \\n[63] \\nThe defendants say that Mr. Nathans met with the plaintiffs in the morning of September \\n5 to discuss new listing prices for the two income properties, that Mr. Nathans then spoke with \\nMr. Subramaniam by telephone twice, that Mr. Nathans then spoke again with Mr. Graf to convey \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\nMr. Subramaniam’s proposed verbal agreement, which Mr. Graf accepted, that the APS’s were \\nthen prepared and signed by the proposed purchasers (Mr. Tharmagalingam and Mr. \\nPeriyathamby) late in the day, and that the APS’s were then presented to the plaintiffs on \\nSeptember 6, 2014 at another in person meeting. \\n[64] \\nAgain, I am satisfied that it is the plaintiffs’ version of events which should be accepted.  \\nThere was a single meeting with Mr. Nathans on September 5, 2014, at which he presented APS’s \\nalready signed by the proposed purchasers of the income properties and by Mr. Subramaniam on \\nbehalf of the numbered company that was selling Oscar’s.  The meeting happened on Ms. Graf’s \\nlunch hour as she described.  As a full-time employee, she could not meet at any other time that \\nday, or at least not at the time described by Mr. Nathans. \\n[65] \\nSeveral factors lead to these conclusions, which I catalogue as follows: \\na. The plaintiff’s version of events is straightforward and sensible.  They had discussed \\nreducing the list prices of the two income properties a few days before September 5, \\nunderstood that Mr. Nathans would be able to produce buyers at lower prices and \\nthey met for the purpose of receiving those offers, which they accepted. \\n \\nb. It is clear that the APS’s for the income properties were prepared prior to September \\n5, 2014, not on that date as Mr. Nathans and Mr. Subramaniam testified.  Both \\ndocuments are originally dated September 2, 2015, and reflect an offer open until \\nSeptember 3, 2014.  The documents were then amended by hand to reflect offers \\ndated September 5, 2014, open until September 6, 2014.  This is consistent with Ms. \\nGraf’s evidence that they knew in advance that offers were to be presented to them \\nwhen they met with Mr. Nathans on September 5 \\n \\nc. The offers and the signatures of the purchasers are dated, in their own handwriting, \\nSeptember 5, 2014. \\n \\nd. The plaintiff’s signatures on the APS’s for the income properties are dated September \\n5, 2014, not September 6.  Again, the date is inserted in their own handwriting. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\n \\ne. The signatures of the purchasers finally accepting the transactions are dated \\nSeptember 6, 2014, in their own handwriting. \\n \\nf. Mr. Graf’s signature on the Oscar’s APS is dated September 5, 2014, in his own \\nhandwriting. \\n \\ng. Mr. Nathans’ handwritten receipt for the deposit paid by Mr. Graf is dated September \\n5, 2014. \\n \\n[66] \\nMr. Nathans was effectively cross-examined on all this evidence which demonstrates that \\nhe had purchasers for the income properties in hand before September 5, that he prepared the \\nAPS’s for the income properties on September 2 (not Sept. 5), that he met with the plaintiffs on \\nSeptember 5 for the purpose of getting them to sign amended listing agreements, to accept offers \\nfor the income properties, and to make an offer on Oscar’s, and that the deals were all finally \\naccepted by the nominee purchasers and by Mr. Subramaniam on the Oscar’s transaction on \\nSeptember 6.  There was no meeting with the plaintiffs on September 6. \\n[67] \\nMr. Nathans’ evidence that the dates on the documents were accidents or mistakes is not \\ncredible.  He said that he made mistakes using the online form such that the dates of September 2 \\nand 3 appeared instead of September 5 and 6, and that that those mistakes repeated themselves in \\nsubsequent documents.  I do not accept that evidence especially given that it is contradicted by all \\nof the handwritten dates on the documents, all of which conform with the version of events \\nprovided by the plaintiffs.  I do not believe that all who signed the documents uniformly and \\nrepeatedly wrote the wrong date when they executed those documents.  It is much more likely that \\nthey uniformly and repeatedly recorded the correct date, and I so find. \\n[68] \\nI am also of the view that Mr. Subramaniam’s evidence respecting September 5 is also \\nincredible.  I do not accept that in the space of a few hours he learned of the reduced prices for the \\nincome properties, decided that he wanted to buy them, devised his alleged verbal agreement \\nconnecting all three transactions, described that proposed deal to Mr. Nathans (who in turn got Mr. \\nGraf to agree to it), and then convinced two friends to “act as buyers” of the two properties in some \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\nill-defined capacity.  Again, it is much more likely that the friends, Mr. Tharmalingam and Mr. \\nPeriyathamby, were engaged by Mr. Subramaniam to act on or before September 2, when their \\nnames were applied to the APS’s by Mr. Nathans for the income properties, and I so find. \\n[69] \\nI am also of the view that there were no discussions of a verbal agreement connecting the \\nthree transactions, or of Mr. Subramaniam’s involvement in the income property transactions, but \\nI will return to those topics below. \\n3.4 Did the plaintiffs make a fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation? \\n \\n[70] \\nThe APS’s for the two income properties both referred to the properties as being in use as \\nsingle family residences.  This was not correct.  The defendants say that the plaintiffs \\nmisrepresented the nature of the properties to the purchasers.  It is further argued that the \\ntransaction for the Kitchener property failed because the lender refused to fund the purchase when \\nit discovered that the property was not a single-family residence as reflected in the APS. \\n[71] \\nThe facts do not support the defendants’ position.  The APS for the Kitchener property \\nwas, as I have said, prepared by Mr. Nathans before September 5, 2014.  He was acting for both \\nbuyer and seller on that transaction and he had complete knowledge of the nature of the property.  \\nHe had personally inspected it.  Moreover, Mr. Nathans had been provided with copies of the rental \\nagreements for the property which show that the property was a triplex and was being used by \\nmore than one family.  The MLS Data Information Form, which Mr. Nathans prepared with the \\nplaintiffs, referred to the property as “Residential – Duplex,” and noted that the house had three \\nkitchens, a separate basement entrance, and was an “investor’s dream property” that came \\nequipped with three refrigerators and three stoves.  These points are all repeated in the listing, \\nwhich Mr. Nathans created.  Moreover, the APS allowed for the purchaser to inspect the property, \\nwhich would make clear that it was not a single-family residence.  In any case, on September 10, \\n2014, the parties to the transaction agreed to an amendment of the APS whereby the purchaser \\nagreed to assume the tenants then living at the property upon closing. \\n[72] \\nIn addition, Mr. Nathans testified that Mr. Subramaniam, who was the actual purchaser of \\nthe property, although he was using his friend Mr. Tharmalingam and then his wife as nominal \\npurchasers, was aware that the Kitchener property was not a single-family residence.  In this \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\nrespect it bears repeating that Mr. Nathans and Mr. Subramaniam are very close business \\nassociates. \\n[73] \\nThere was no misrepresentation by the plaintiffs.  The purchaser was at all times aware \\nthat the Kitchener property was not a single-family residence.  The plaintiff’s signed the APS \\nprepared by Mr. Nathans on September 5 and did not notice the erroneous reference to the contrary.  \\nThis was a mistake, an oversight, and, in any case, given that the defendants were well-aware of \\nthe nature of the Kitchener property, the responsibility to describe the property properly to \\nprospective lenders lay with them.  As Mr. Settimi put it in his October 28 email to Ms. Sathya, \\n“this has nothing to do with our clients. \\n3.5 Was there a verbal agreement? \\n \\n[74] \\nMr. Subramaniam testified that there was a verbal agreement, nowhere reduced to writing, \\nthat had two components.  The first component was that Mr. Subramaniam would arrange for two \\nbuyers for the plaintiffs’ two income properties at the reduced prices set on September 5 if Mr. \\nGraf agreed to purchase Oscar’s.  The second component was that if either of the income property \\ndeals did not close for any reason, all parties would sign mutual releases and return the deposits \\nmade without deduction of any kind. \\n[75] \\nThe plaintiffs deny that there was any such arrangement.  They never spoke to Mr. \\nSubramaniam and deny that Mr. Nathans ever put such a proposal to them for their consideration \\nand agreement.  They had no idea that the purchasers of their income properties (Mr. Periyathamby \\nand Mr. Tharmalingam) were in any way connected to the transaction for Oscar’s, or to Mr. \\nSubramanian (whose role they did not fully understand), and they never agreed that if one of the \\nincome property transactions failed, they would both fail. \\n[76] \\nI accept the evidence of the plaintiffs and find against the defendants on these points, for \\nseveral reasons, summarized as follows: \\na. I accept the plaintiffs’ evidence that they did not deal with or understand the true role \\nof Mr. Subramanian.  While it is true that Mr. Subramaniam signed the APS on behalf \\nof the numbered company which was selling Oscar’s, there is no evidence that that \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\nsignature was drawn to their attention, or that they otherwise adverted to it, or that it \\nwould have been significant to them when they received that APS.  As I have already \\nfound, they understood that Mr. Nathans was at least an owner of Oscar’s and dealt \\nwith him accordingly.  The plaintiffs did not know enough about Mr. Subramaniam \\nto add him to their statement of claim when they launched this action. \\n \\nb. I accept that the plaintiffs knew of no connection between the proposed purchasers \\nof their income properties and either Mr. Subramanian or Oscar’s. \\n \\nc. The plaintiffs never advised their lawyer, Mr. Settimi, of the alleged verbal \\nagreement, and never sought his advice on such an agreement.  There was no reason \\nfor them to fail to disclose such an agreement to their own solicitor. \\n \\nd. Mr. Settimi was not advised by anyone, including Ms. Sathya and Mr. Vaid, of any \\nconnection between the transactions. \\n \\ne. No one advised either Mr. Sathya or Mr. Vaid of the alleged verbal agreement or of \\nany connection between the transactions or the purchasers. \\n \\nf. Nothing until Mr. Nathans’ email of October 31, 2014, suggests any legal linkage \\nbetween the three transactions, and even that email simply alleges that the deals are \\n“interlinked” but does nothing to explain that linkage or its significance.  Dealing \\nwith this fact in his affidavit, Mr. Nathans claimed that, as a non-lawyer, he “could \\nnot fully articulate the Verbal Agreement.”  I reject that explanation as incredible \\nespecially given that Mr. Nathans is said to have been the person who described the \\nverbal agreement to the Mr. Graf and given that it is straightforwardly described in \\nhis own affidavit, upon which he was cross-examined before me, during which cross-\\nexamination it became clear that Mr. Nathans is not unsophisticated.  I conclude that \\nit is much more likely that he could not describe the verbal agreement to Mr. Settimi \\nbecause it did not exist. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\n \\ng. As I have already found, the defendants’ description of the events of September 5 \\nand 6, 2014, when the alleged verbal agreement is said to have crystallized, does not \\nalign with the documentary record, as I have found above.  It is not credible. \\n \\nh. After the verbal agreement was allegedly accepted by Mr. Graf, Mr. Nathans and Mr. \\nSubramaniam – both experienced real estate brokers – caused the parties to sign three \\nAPS’s each of which contained an entire agreement clause which, on its face, had \\nthe effect of nullifying any previous verbal agreement.6  If there had been such an \\nagreement, they should have, and would have, struck out these provisions.  I accept \\nthat the fact that a verbal agreement is nowhere put into writing is not a bar to finding \\nthat there was a verbal agreement (see Mountain v. Mountain Estate, 2012 ONCA \\n806, at para. 66), but the documents in this case are positively inconsistent with the \\nexistence of such a verbal agreement.  \\n \\ni. Mr. Subramaniam’s evidence that he did not put the verbal agreement into writing \\nbecause he thought that its existence would hamper the ability of the purchasers to \\nget financing for the transactions, does not inspire confidence.  It suggests that he \\nwas willing to attempt to mislead the lenders about the nature of the transactions in \\norder to secure mortgages and tells against his credibility. \\n \\nj. Similarly, Mr. Subramaniam’s decision to use nominee purchasers for the two \\nincome properties, is also suspect.  It is likely that he did so because his own \\nprecarious financial situation (he made a consumer proposal in bankruptcy shortly \\nafter these events in 2016), meant it was unlikely he could successfully apply for \\n                                                 \\n \\n6 In the APS’s for the income properties, the relevant portion of the paragraph bearing the heading \\n“AGREEMENT IN WRITING” reads as follows: “There is no representation, warranty, collateral agreement \\nor condition affecting this Agreement other than as expressed herein.”  In the Oscar’s APS, the relevant portion \\nof the paragraph bearing the heading “AGREEMENT IN WRITING” reads as follows: “This Agreement, \\nincluding any Schedule attached hereto, shall constitute the entire Agreement between Buyer and Seller.  There \\nis no representation, warranty, collateral agreement or condition, which affects this Agreement other than as \\nexpressed herein.” \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\nfinancing in his own name.  I note that the nominee purchasers who testified before \\nme were not able to explain their role on these transactions coherently.  Some of the \\nevidence suggests that they were to be the actual purchasers and that Mr. \\nSubramaniam was simply promising to indemnify them against any loss, or that they \\nwere to be trustees of some kind, but I am satisfied that Mr. Subramaniam was to be \\nthe actual purchaser and they were lending their names to the transactions and \\napplications for mortgage financing. \\n \\nk. I agree with the suggestion of the plaintiffs that it is likely that the applications for \\nfinancing made by the purchasers intentionally and falsely referred to the properties \\nas single family residences and indicated that the purchasers were going to be \\noccupying the properties personally, in an effort to increase the chances of financing \\nbeing granted.  I accept that it is more than likely that Mr. Nathans purposely referred \\nto the properties as single family residences on the APS’s for the same reason.  In \\nthis respect, it is noteworthy that Mr. Nathans did not involve Mr. Sathya in the \\namendment of the APS for the Kitchener property in which the purchaser agreed to \\nassume the then tenants of the property.  Indeed, Ms. Sathya was unaware of the \\namendment until after the deal had failed because, as she testified, no one ever sent \\nher a copy of it.  I pause to note here that I reject Mr. Nathans’ evidence that he did \\nsend the amendment to Ms. Sathya.  By contrast, the plaintiffs promptly provided a \\ncopy of the amendment to Mr. Settimi.  In light of this evidence, I accept Mr. Graf’s \\nevidence that Mr. Nathans attempted to get Mr. Graf to sign a document confirming \\n(falsely) that the Kitchener property was a single-family residence.  \\n \\nl. As evidence of the alleged verbal agreement, the defendants point to discussions that \\nthe Mr. Graf and Mr. Nathans had respecting how the purchase of Oscar’s would be \\nfinanced given that the plaintiffs expected that the sales of the income properties \\nwould not generate enough capital to purchase Oscar’s outright.  Mr. Graf agreed in \\nhis evidence that there were discussions about making monthly payments to the seller \\nof Oscar’s as a means of completing the transaction. However, I accept Mr. Graf’s \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\nevidence that these discussions were uncertain and that no agreement was ever \\nachieved on these points. \\n \\nm. Last, as I have already found, the defendants and Mr. Nathans suffer from a serious \\ncredibility deficit. Very little of their evidence is corroborated by the documentary \\nrecords (and/or is positively contradicted by that record) and much of it (as I have \\nexplained here and under the previous headings in these reasons) makes little sense \\nto me. \\n \\n[77] \\nThe only facet of the evidence before me which has given me any pause is the decision of \\nthe purchasers of the income properties to waive the financing conditions in their favour on \\nSeptember 12, 2014.  This, on its face, seems to have been an unwise decision that is difficult to \\nexplain, but Mr. Subramaniam testified that he was comfortable doing so because he knew that the \\nplaintiffs had verbally agreed to provide mutual releases if either deal failed. \\n[78] \\nHaving considered the matter carefully, however, I do not accept this explanation.  Even if \\nthere were a verbal agreement, on the evidence before me it made little sense for the purchasers to \\nwaive the condition before they had secured financing.  There is no evidence that they or Mr. \\nSubramanian secured any benefit from waiving the condition, nor that the plaintiffs sought such a \\nwaiver.  I note that Mr. Graf did not waive the financing condition in his favour on the Oscar’s \\ntransaction even though, had there been a verbal agreement as described, he should have been as \\ncomfortable doing so as Mr. Subramaniam says he was.  In any case, as I have already laid out \\nabove, the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that there was no verbal agreement, and I find \\nthat there was no such verbal agreement. I conclude that the decision of the purchasers of the \\nincome properties to waive the financing conditions is explained by facts or reasoning not in \\nevidence before me. \\n[79] \\nThe defendants also point to the delivery of mutual releases immediately upon the failure \\nof the transactions, to Mr. Nathans’ email of October 31, 2014, and to the failure of the plaintiffs \\nto respond to that email, as evidence of the existence of the verbal agreement.  I do not agree that \\nthis evidence establishes the existence of the alleged agreement.  In my view, the attempt to secure \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 25 \\n \\n \\nmutual releases said to be referrable to an alleged verbal agreement was a desperate and fictitious \\nafter the fact creation intended to avoid liability for the failed transactions – which liability lay \\nentirely at the feet of the defendants.  The failure to respond to Mr. Nathans’ email signifies \\nnothing.  The plaintiffs’ solicitor had already made it plain that his clients intended to sue, and this \\nis what they did.  This action constitutes a clear denial of what was alleged in the October 31 email.  \\n4. Conclusions \\n[80] \\nGiven that I have found that there was no verbal agreement as alleged by the defendants, \\nnor any misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiffs, the contracts in the form of the APS’s on \\nthe two income property transactions must be given their effect.  The defendants were in breach \\nof both contracts by failing to close the deals as they had agreed to do. \\n[81] \\nFurther, while it is strictly speaking not necessary to make this point given the findings I \\nhave made, even if there were some verbal agreement which preceded the signing of the APS’s, \\nthe effect of the entire agreement clauses is that such an agreement cannot be given any effect or \\nbe enforced.  It is superseded by the written contracts.  \\n[82] \\nIn Soboczynski v. Beauchamp, 2015 ONCA 282, the court held as follows (at paras. 41 and \\n43; emphasis in the original): \\n… The entire agreement clause in the APS operates retrospectively, not \\nprospectively. In other words, the application of the clause is restricted to limit \\nrepresentations, warranties, collateral agreements and conditions made prior to or \\nduring the negotiations leading up to the signing of the APS. … \\n \\nAn entire agreement clause is generally intended to lift and distill the parties' \\nbargain from the muck of the negotiations. In limiting the expression of the parties' \\nintentions to the written form, the clause attempts to provide certainty and clarity. \\n \\nSee also Shelanu Inc. v. Print Three Franchising Corp. (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 533 (C.A.), at para. \\n50; Fung v. Decca Homes Limited, et al., 2019 ONCA 848, at para. 5. \\n[83] \\nIn this case, the defendants allege that the verbal agreement preceded the written \\nagreements including their entire agreement clauses.  Therefore, in the absence of \\nmisrepresentation by the plaintiffs, the written contracts govern. \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 26 \\n \\n \\n[84] \\nI turn then to the orders to be made. \\n[85] \\nWith respect to the Waterloo property, the defendants Chitra and Mahesan Subramaniam \\nwill forfeit to the plaintiffs the deposit of $5,000 paid on that transaction and which is now held \\nby the Sheriff.  The deposit is not disproportionate and ordering forfeiture is not unconscionable \\neven in the absence of damages on this transaction (see Redstone Enterprises Ltd. v. Simple \\nTechnology Inc., 2017 ONCA 282, at paras. 15 – 30). \\n[86] \\nWith respect to the Kitchener property, damages were incurred.  As noted earlier in these \\nreasons, the Kitchener property sold for $73,500 less than the purchase price agreed to by the \\ndefendants.  The plaintiffs moved promptly to mitigate their damages by re-listing the property \\nand, after waiting several months for an offer, accepting the first offer which was made. \\n[87] \\nThe defendants argue that the price at which the plaintiffs agreed to sell the Kitchener \\nproperty to Mr. Periyathamby was artificially high and did not properly reflect the market value \\nof the property.  Therefore, in the absence of expert evidence of the market value of the property, \\nthe plaintiffs have not shown that they have suffered any actual damages. \\n[88] \\nI do not accept this argument.  Mr. Periyathamby and the actual buyer, Mr. Subramaniam, \\nwere aware that the property had been on the market and had not sold at its original list price.  \\nThey offered to purchase the Kitchener property at a lowered price.  There is no evidence that that \\nprice was unfair at that time or that the offer was not voluntarily made.  Having rejected the \\nexistence of the alleged verbal agreement, I also reject the suggestion that a higher and artificial \\nprice for the Kitchener property was agreed to as part of that verbal agreement.  I find that the price \\nagreed upon was the price that the parties’ believed reflected the market at that time. \\n[89] \\nHaving freely entered into the contract, and having failed to honour it, the defendants Mr. \\nPeriyathamby and Mr. Subramaniam are liable for damages flowing from that failure and assumed \\nthe risk that the market would fall between the date of the breach and the date that plaintiffs were \\nable to sell the property to a new buyer.  That is what happened in this case.  The damages are \\ncalculated as the difference between the APS price for the Kitchener property and the price at \\nwhich it ultimately sold to a new buyer plus any lost transaction costs (Azzarello v. Shawqi, 2019 \\nONCA 820, at para. 21).  The difference in prices in this case is $73,500.  The plaintiffs’ lost \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 27 \\n \\n \\ntransaction costs are the amount they paid to Mr. Settimi for legal fees, disbursements and taxes \\non the failed Waterloo transaction, or $2,784.60. \\n[90] \\nIn total then, the damages on the Waterloo transaction are $76,284.60.  The $5,000 deposit \\nheld in connection with the Waterloo property will be forfeited to the plaintiffs and applied against \\nthese damages. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5. Disposition and Costs \\n[91] \\nIt is ordered that the $5,000 deposit made in connection with the Kitchener property is \\nforfeited to the plaintiffs by the defendants Chitra and Mahesan Subramaniam. \\n[92] \\nMr. Subramaniam and Mr. Periyathamby are ordered to pay to the plaintiffs damages in \\nthe amount of $76,284.60, plus pre-judgment interest from October 14, 2014, at the rate of 1.3%, \\npayable forthwith. \\n[93] \\nIt is ordered that the $5,000 deposit made in connection with the Waterloo property is \\nforfeited to the plaintiffs by Mr. Subramaniam and Mr. Periyathamby and is to be applied to the \\ndamages I have ordered them to pay. \\n[94] \\nThe counterclaim is dismissed. \\n[95] \\nIf the parties are unable to agree on costs, the plaintiffs may serve and file brief written \\nsubmissions respecting costs no later than April 8, 2024.  The defendants may serve and file brief \\nresponding submissions within 7 days of the service of the plaintiffs’ submissions.  The plaintiffs \\nmay serve and file reply submissions, if any, within 4 days of the service of the defendants’ \\nsubmissions. Submissions can be forwarded by email to my judicial assistant at \\nmona.goodwin@ontario.ca and Kitchener.SCJJA@ontario.ca. \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1062 (CanLII)\\nPage: 28 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nI.R.

Agarwal \\n \\nI. \\nINTRODUCTION \\n[1]      The applicant Ishan Kalra and the respondent Shruti Bhatia, with the child of their \\nmarriage SK, moved to Canada to start a new life. But they brought with them the trials and \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 2 - \\n \\n \\n \\ntribulations of their troubled marriage. Less than three months after Ishan arrived in Canada \\nand was reunited with Shruti and SK, the parties separated. Rather than agreeing on \\ndecision-making responsibility and parenting time or litigating those issues, Shruti tricked \\nIshan into believing that if he tried to contact SK, he’d be arrested. In the meantime, she \\nabducted SK to India, where SK remains. SK hasn’t seen her father in over 15 months. \\n[2]      Ishan moves for an order that Shruti return SK to Canada and for a parenting order. \\nShruti claims that the Ontario court has no jurisdiction to make a parenting order because \\nSK is habitually resident in India. \\n[3]      This case raises a special and, in my view, increasing challenge for our family court \\nsystem. As Canada welcomes new immigrants and their families to study, live, and work \\nhere, our courts face the unique problem of children who live in and have connections to \\nmore than one place. The strength of their parents’ ties to Canada may wax and wane \\ndepending on the economy, changes in government policy, their health or the health of their \\nextended family members, the nature of the parties’ relationship, or changes in their needs \\nand desires. Parents may move to Canada only to get a Canadian education, and then return \\nto their country of origin to start their careers. Or they may relocate here, along with their \\nimmediate and extended family, intending to become citizens. Or they may immigrate with \\none intention, but their plans change when their lives do. Their immigration status may allow \\nthem to travel between Canada and their country of origin frequently and stay in one place \\nfor a long time, without necessarily making that place their habitual residence. And, when a \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 3 - \\n \\n \\n \\nparent leaves Canada for a non-Hague Convention country with a child, our laws don’t provide \\na framework for how Ontario courts can enforce its jurisdiction over that child. \\n[4]      In this case, I find that SK was habitually resident in Ontario at the start of this \\napplication. Thus, the Ontario courts have jurisdiction to make a parenting order. That said, \\nI decline to make an interim parenting order at this time. I have insufficient evidence to \\ndetermine what is in SK’s best interests. I’m also not persuaded that I have jurisdiction to \\nmake a “chasing order” as Ishan requests. Instead, I order that Shruti shall serve and file an \\nanswer on or before April 17, 2024. At the direction of the Regional Senior Justice, I’m \\nassigned to manage this case and monitor its progress. The parties shall attend a case \\nconference by videoconference at 9am on April 23, 2024.  \\nII. \\nBACKGROUND \\nA. \\nFacts \\n[5]      The parties were married in India in February 2017. SK was born in December 2017 \\nin India. The parties and SK are all Indian citizens. Shruti immigrated to Canada on a study \\npermit in April 2021. She enrolled at Algoma College.  \\n[6]      Shruti went to India in July 2021. She continued her education online. Shruti \\nreturned to Canada in March 2022 with SK (with Ishan’s consent). SK attended the local \\npublic school full-time. Shruti and SK visited India from June 27, 2022, to July 21, 2022.  \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 4 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[7]      Ishan intended to immigrate to Canada with Shruti and SK, but his application for a \\nvisa was refused. Ishan eventually came to Canada in October 2022 on an open work \\npermit.1 The parties rented a house in Brampton. Shruti completed her studies in December \\n2022. \\n[8]      Ishan moved out of the matrimonial home on December 20, 2022. Ishan blames \\nShruti for his departure; Shruti says Ishan left of his own volition. Ishan returned to the \\nmatrimonial home on December 25, 2022, to get his belongings. \\n[9]      That same day, Ishan and Shruti messaged each other in Hindi and English (Hindi \\ntranslation italicized): \\nIshan: Now I can’t stay with you anymore you give me the daughter and I will \\ntake care of her very well please take the daughter back for a few days to \\nIndia she will get better there as she wants friend \\nShruti: now I will not be going \\nIshan: You told me to leave the house so I left and came further I don’t want to be \\nupset with daily fight \\nShruti: you go to India take child with you \\n[10]      In January 2023, Shruti asked Ishan to complete an application to change SK’s \\nname. He didn’t do so.  \\n                                         \\n1 Ishan described the permit as a “spouse open work permit”, which I understand to mean \\nan open work permit granted to spouses of international students or foreign workers. \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 5 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[11]      Ishan didn’t see SK after he and Shruti separated: he wasn’t “mentally stable”, he \\ndidn’t have housing, he couldn’t afford food, and he didn’t have “much funds” (Arpit \\nGupta, a friend, let Ishan stay rent-free with him immediately after the separation). Ishan \\ntried to contact Shruti through a mutual friend—she allegedly responded, “he’s dead to me”.  \\n[12]      In February 2023, Shruti’s lawyer Rajat Chauhan (who isn’t Shruti’s lawyer on this \\nmotion) emailed Ishan a notarized declaration entitled “Reporting Letter of Separation”. The \\ndeclaration states that Shruti had obtained a restraining order against Ishan: “That there is a \\nrestraining order issued for you, Ishan Kalra which restricts you to meet me and my child, \\n[SK].” The declaration also threatens “monetary and criminal actions” if Ishan doesn’t stop \\nhis “harassment and other unwanted actions”. The declaration says that Shruti had \\n“independent legal advice” for “drafting” the letter. \\n[13]      Around this time, Shruti was working at a restaurant in Vaughan.  \\n[14]      In April 2023, Shruti and SK visited India for Shruti’s brother’s wedding. SK has \\nremained in India since then.  \\n[15]      Shruti returned to Canada on July 3, 2023. She remained in Ontario until December \\n12, 2023, except for around 3 weeks in September and October, when she visited India for \\nSK’s birthday. She rented a room in Wasaga Beach and worked in a restaurant. Shruti has a \\nvisitor visa (which allows her to travel to Canada) valid from March 3, 2023, to January 30, \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 6 - \\n \\n \\n \\n2027. She has a work permit (which allows her to work in Canada) valid from February 2023 \\nto February 2026. \\n[16]      Ishan was frightened by the threat of a restraining order. He thought that if he tried \\nto see SK, the police would put him “directly in jail”. He didn’t have money to retain a \\nlawyer. He eventually raised enough money to have a brief consultation with a lawyer in \\nApril or May 2023.  \\n[17]      In August, Ishan’s father saw SK in India. Ishan didn’t know that Shruti had taken \\nSK to India. That same month, Ishan emailed Mr. Chauhan asking for a copy of the \\nrestraining order. Mr. Chauhan didn’t respond. Ishan finally retained a lawyer. The lawyer \\nchecked the court file—there’s no restraining order against Ishan. \\n[18]      There are several proceedings in India. First, on April 21, 2023, the police, under \\nsection 154 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, “reduced to writing” the information that \\nShruti provided them alleging “commission of a cognizable offence”. This document is a \\nFirst Information Report. As I understand, an FIR is like reporting a crime to the police. On \\nthe basis of this FIR, the Indian court issued a warrant for Ishan’s arrest. He says he’s never \\nbeen served with the warrant. Second, on October 6, 2023, Shruti started family court \\nproceedings against Ishan for a divorce under section 13(1) of The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. \\nFinally, on November 24, 2023, Shruti and her mother started family court proceedings \\nagainst Ishan’s parents, seeking the equivalent of a restraining order against them. \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 7 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[19]      Both parties allege that the other was abusive and violent, which is what led to the \\nmarriage breakdown. I don’t find this evidence probative of the jurisdiction issues—though \\nfamily violence might be a relevant fact or circumstance to determining parental intention in \\nsome cases (for example, if a parent moved to escape family violence), I don’t find that it’s \\nmaterial here. \\nB. \\nLitigation History \\n[20]      On September 18, 2023, Ishan started a family law case seeking a divorce, a \\nparenting order, and table child support. Ishan couldn’t file the application because he didn’t \\nhave a personal income tax return and notice of assessment for the three most recent \\ntaxation years (he wasn’t a Canadian taxpayer before 2022). \\n[21]      On September 22, 2023, Ishan filed an “urgent motion”. Under the Notice to the \\nProfession and Parties – Central West Region, updated effective September 1, 2023, a party may \\nseek an urgent motion on notice without a case conference in situations of “urgency or \\nhardship such as abduction”. See also Family Law Rules, r 14(4.2), which allows motions \\nbefore a case conference in a “situation of urgency or hardship”.  \\n[22]      Ishan’s notice of motion sought various relief, including an order that he be allowed \\nto file his application without tax information, an order for substituted service (because he \\nonly had Shruti’s email address), and an order that Shruti return SK to Ontario. The judge \\nreviewing the motion concluded that it wasn’t urgent. Ishan was directed to schedule a \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 8 - \\n \\n \\n \\nmotion for substituted service in the ordinary course. The motion judge also granted him \\nleave to file his application without the tax information. The endorsement made clear that \\nthe issue of jurisdiction “must also be addressed”. \\n[23]      Shruti acknowledges receiving notice of the proceeding by email on October 16, \\n2023 (which apparently resolved the service issue). This application was finally issued on \\nNovember 10, 2023.2 She retained a lawyer. She hasn’t answered the case (presumably \\nbecause she’s challenging jurisdiction and doesn’t want to attorn). \\n[24]      Ishan scheduled a motion for January 5, 2024. Ishan’s notice of motion again \\nsought, among other things, an order that Shruti return SK to Ontario. Ishan filed two \\naffidavits, dated November 8, 2023, and December 29, 2023. Shruti filed an affidavit, dated \\nDecember 4, 2023. Shruti’s affidavit asserts that SK’s habitual residence is India. \\n[25]      At the hearing on January 5th, the motion judge adjourned the motion to an Early \\nCase Conference. The motion judge wasn’t persuaded that the motion should be heard \\nbefore a case conference. \\n[26]      On January 22, 2024, I presided over a case conference in this matter. Given that \\nthe motion raised allegations of abduction, the Regional Senior Justice directed me to \\n                                         \\n2 The “Date of Issue” on the Form 8: Application (General) states “November 10, 2022”. \\nBut the clerk’s signature is dated November 10, 2023, and the parties concede that the \\napplication was issued in 2023 not 2022. \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 9 - \\n \\n \\n \\nschedule a hearing of this motion promptly.3 I endorsed a timetable for the remaining steps \\nin the motion. Given the credibility issues raised by the parties’ evidence, I directed that the \\nparties and their affiants be cross-examined orally. See Zafar v Azeem, 2024 ONCA 15, at \\npara 69. I allowed Shruti and her affiants to testify by videoconference because they were in \\nIndia.  \\n[27]      Ishan filed another affidavit, dated February 12, 2024. He also filed an affidavit \\nfrom Mr. Gupta. Shruti filed another affidavit, dated February 20, 2024.  \\nC. \\nEvidentiary Issues \\n1. \\nInadmissible Evidence \\n[28]      The parties’ affidavits included inadmissible evidence. For evidence to be receivable, \\nit must be “relevant, material and admissible.” Evidence is relevant if “as a matter of human \\nexperience and logic, the existence of a particular fact, directly or indirectly, makes the \\nexistence of a fact more probable than it would be otherwise.” Evidence is material if what it \\nis “offered to prove is in issue” in the proceedings or assists the trier of fact in assessing \\nother evidence. Evidence is admissible if the trier of fact is legally permitted to consider it. If \\nthe evidence is relevant and material but inadmissible, it can’t be considered by the trier of \\nfact. See R v Candir, 2009 ONCA 915, at paras 48-49 \\n                                         \\n3 Rule 37.2 of the Family Law Rules applies to “international child abduction cases”, which are \\ndefined as “an application involving the alleged wrongful removal to or retention of a child \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 10 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[29]      For example, Shruti alleges Ishan cheated on her. Ishan denies the allegation. Shruti \\nintroduced a photo of Ishan’s alleged mistress, sitting on a couch, by herself. This evidence \\ndoesn’t prove that Ishan was having an affair (even if that evidence were somehow material \\nto the issue of jurisdiction).  \\n[30]      Shruti also adduced “legal research” done by her lawyer as an exhibit to her \\naffidavit. This evidence is plainly inadmissible—there’s no need for a witness to attach \\nstatements of law to their affidavit when their lawyer can file a factum for the motion. \\n[31]      Shruti introduced a Facebook message chat between her and Ishan that was in \\nHindi, but wasn’t translated by a certified interpreter. It is inadmissible. Shruti withdrew this \\nexhibit. \\n[32]      Finally, both parties relied on evidence that wasn’t material. The issue on this \\nmotion is SK’s habitual residence. Shruti’s December 4th affidavit introduces evidence about \\na dowry, harassment, Ishan’s alleged alcoholism, Ishan’s family’s preference for a son, and \\nbroken financial commitments. Ishan responded point-by-point to Shruti’s allegations. Shruti \\nreplied. Ishan sur-replied. It’s possible this evidence was introduced for the parenting order \\nsought by Ishan (though, even then, it’s hard to see how some of this evidence is relevant or \\nmaterial to the child’s best interests).  \\n                                                                                                                                   \\nin Ontario”. Here, SK has been allegedly wrongfully removed from Ontario so the case is \\ngoverned by the usual rules for motions, case conferences, and urgency. \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 11 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[33]      At the hearing, when Ishan’s and Shruti’s lawyers sought to cross-examine the \\nwitnesses on these allegations, I asked about the relevance of this evidence on the \\njurisdiction issue. Rather than defend its relevance, the lawyers chose to move on to other \\nquestions. I took that to mean that they either agreed that the evidence was immaterial or \\nthey weren’t relying on it.  \\n[34]      Only Ishan, Shruti, and Mr. Gupta were cross-examined. Both parties attached \\naffidavits from their family members as exhibits to their affidavits. It’s unclear why they \\ndidn’t file these affidavits independently (other than, perhaps, to get around the Notice, which \\nlimits evidence on short motions to one primary affidavit—though this rule doesn’t apply to \\nwrongful removal cases). These other witnesses weren’t presented for cross-examination, so \\nthe evidence is inadmissible. The parties agreed that this evidence was being withdrawn. \\n2. \\nCredibility Issues \\n[35]      Credibility and reliability are different. Credibility has to do with a witness’s veracity, \\nreliability with the accuracy of the witness’s testimony. Reliability engages consideration of \\nthe witness’s ability to accurately observe, recall, and recount events in issue. Any witness \\nwhose evidence on an issue isn’t credible can’t give reliable evidence on the same point. \\nCredibility, on the other hand, isn’t a proxy for reliability: a credible witness may give \\nunreliable evidence. See R v GF, 2021 SCC 20, at para 82; R v HC, 2009 ONCA 56, at para \\n41. \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 12 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[36]      As I elaborate on below, I don’t find Shruti’s evidence to be reliable or credible. She \\ndidn’t seem honest about several issues, including her explanation about the alleged \\nrestraining order or her reasons for returning to Canada in July 2023. I believe she \\ndeliberately lied to trick Ishan from having contact with SK. I believe she lied again about \\nwhy she returned to Canada to try to undermine her and SK’s ties to Canada. Her evidence \\nabout Ishan’s alleged consent was unreasonable—the messages between her and Ishan say \\nthe opposite of what she says happened.  \\n[37]      In contrast, I found Ishan’s evidence to be reliable and credible. He seemed honest, \\nincluding about events that aren’t favourable to him (such as his failure to contact SK \\nbetween December 2022 and February 2023). His evidence was reasonable and consistent. \\nUnlike Shruti, his explanations made sense. \\nD. \\nLegislative Framework \\n[38]      Ishan effectively seeks a “chasing order”. This term is used under Article 12 of the \\nHague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Can TS 1983 No 35, to \\ndescribe an order for “return of the child” where they’ve been “wrongfully removed or \\nretained”. \\n[39]      India isn’t a party to the Hague Convention. As a result, Ishan relies on the Children’s \\nLaw Reform Act, RSO 1990, c C.12, and the court’s parens patriae jurisdiction. \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 13 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[40]      A court shall only exercise its jurisdiction to make a parenting order with respect to \\na child if the child is habitually resident in Ontario at the start of the application for the \\norder. See CLRA, s 22(1)(a). Sections 22(1)(b) and 23 don’t apply here because SK hasn’t \\nbeen physically present in Ontario since April 2023. \\n[41]      A child is habitually resident in the place where the child resided in whichever of the \\nfollowing circumstances last occurred: \\n1. With both parents. \\n \\n2. If the parents are living separate and apart, with one parent \\nunder a separation agreement or with the consent, implied \\nconsent or acquiescence of the other or under a court order. \\n \\n3.  With a person other than a parent on a permanent basis for a \\nsignificant period of time. \\n \\nSee CLRA, s 22(2). \\n[42]      The removal or withholding of a child without the consent of all persons having \\ndecision-making responsibility over the child doesn’t alter the habitual residence of the child \\nunless there’s been acquiescence or undue delay in commencing due process by the person \\nfrom whom the child is removed or withheld. See CLRA, s 22(3). \\n[43]      A court having jurisdiction to make a parenting order with respect to a child may \\ndecline to exercise its jurisdiction if it believes that it’s more appropriate for jurisdiction to be \\nexercised outside Ontario. See CLRA, s 25. \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 14 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[44]      Though both parties relied on section 40 of the CLRA, it’s not applicable here. \\nSection 40 gives the court discretion to order the return the child to another jurisdiction. \\n[45]      Under section 37, the court can make certain orders to prevent the unlawful removal \\nof a child from Ontario. That said, I wasn’t provided any statutory authority giving me \\njurisdiction to order the return of SK to Ontario.  \\nIII. \\nANALYSIS AND DISPOSITION \\n[46]      The parties’ evidence and submissions raise two issues: \\n \\n(a) \\nwhether SK was habitually resident in Ontario or India when this application \\nwas started; and \\n \\n(b) \\nwhether there has been acquiescence or undue delay in commencing due \\nprocess by Ishan. \\n[47]      To the extent that I find that Ontario has jurisdiction to make a parenting order, the \\nparties’ evidence and submissions raise the added issue of the appropriate order. \\nA. \\nSK’s Habitual Residence is Ontario \\n[48]      Under section 22(2) of the CLRA, I must first determine whether SK was most \\nrecently living with both parents or with Shruti (with Ishan’s consent, implied consent, or \\nacquiescence). \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 15 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[49]      Ishan asserts that SK was last living with both parents on December 20, 2023. \\nShruti asserts that she and Ishan have been living separate and apart since December 20th \\nand SK was last living in India with her with Ishan’s consent or acquiescence.  \\n1. \\nIshan Didn’t Consent \\n[50]      Shruti’s argument that Ishan consented to SK living with Shruti in India is based on: \\n(a) Ishan’s December 25th messages; and (b) alleged oral statements he made consenting to \\nShruti taking SK to India.  \\n[51]      “Unequivocal consent to such a move must be clear and concise, not based on \\ninferences.” See Duman v Duman, 2017 ONCJ 629, at para 88. \\n[52]      I find that Ishan didn’t consent to SK living with Shruti or in India. First, the text \\nmessages don’t say what Shruti asserts they do. Ishan wasn’t consenting to Shruti taking SK \\nto India permanently—he was suggesting that SK go to India to visit her friends “for a few \\ndays”. He also wasn’t consenting to Shruti having sole decision-making or exclusive \\nparenting time—he offered to “take care of [SK] very well”. Shruti’s argument is \\nundermined by her own words: “you go to India take child with you”. She’s suggesting that \\nif Ishan believes SK should visit her friends, he should take her.  \\n[53]      Second, I don’t find Shruti’s evidence about Ishan’s oral consent credible. In her \\ntwo affidavits, Shruti never mentions these oral statements. Her evidence on this issue was \\nintroduced, for the first time, in cross-examination after Ishan had testified. That is \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 16 - \\n \\n \\n \\nimpermissible case-splitting: a party may not split its case, first relying on prima facie proof, \\nand when this has been shaken by his opponent, adducing confirmatory evidence. See Singer \\nv Schering-Plough Canada Inc., 2010 ONSC 42, at para 52. \\n2. \\nIshan Didn’t Acquiesce \\n[54]      Shruti argues that Ishan acquiesced in SK residing with her in India. She relies on \\nthe fact that Ishan didn’t contact SK after he moved out on December 20th.  \\n[55]      I find that Shruti tricked Ishan into believing that he would be in legal jeopardy if he \\ncontacted her or SK after February 28, 2023. It wasn’t until February 5, 2024 (over a year \\nlater) that Shruti finally confirmed that there was no restraining order against Ishan. \\n[56]      Shruti argues that Ishan could’ve checked with the police, the court, or his parents \\nto confirm that he wasn’t subject to a restraining order. That argument is preposterous—it \\ncan’t be that a party lies about a court order, and then argues that the other party accepted \\nthe situation by either believing the lie or failing to properly investigate the lie. Also, when \\nIshan asked Mr. Chauhan for a copy of the restraining order in August 2023, he received no \\nresponse. I’m not sure what better due diligence there is—he asked Shruti’s agent, who \\nnotarized the letter and emailed it to him, for a copy of an incorporated document only to be \\nmet with stone silence. \\n[57]      Further, Ishan’s context is important here. He moved to Canada, a foreign country, \\ntwo months earlier. He was in Canada on an open work permit that depended on Shruti’s \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 17 - \\n \\n \\n \\nstatus in Canada. As a newcomer, I infer that he didn’t know or have information about how \\nrestraining orders operate here. He didn’t have assets or income to retain a lawyer until \\nAugust 2023. In short, Ishan’s status was incredibly precarious. It’s unsurprising that he \\nfeared contacting Shruti or SK at the risk of jeopardizing his employment status, \\nimmigration status, or, worse, his liberty.  \\n[58]      Finally, Shruti’s evidence around the declaration isn’t credible. Mr. Chauhan sent the \\ndeclaration to Ishan in February 2023. He didn’t respond to Ishan’s request for a copy of the \\nrestraining order in August 2023. Ishan’s November 2023 affidavit introduced the \\ndeclaration. Shruti’s responding affidavit said nothing about the declaration. Ishan pointed \\nthis out in his December affidavit. The issue was then raised at the case conference in \\nJanuary 2024. Then, and only then, Shruti’s lawyer emailed Ishan’s lawyer to explain that the \\nstatement about the restraining order was a “miscommunication” between Shruti and Mr. \\nChauhan. Shruti finally deposed to this alleged miscommunication in her February 2024 \\naffidavit, blaming Mr. Chauhan for inserting the reference to a restraining order. She didn’t \\ncall Mr. Chauhan as a witness. I don’t find that explanation believable. If Shruti’s statement \\nwas truly a misunderstanding, surely she would have explained that at least in her December \\n2023 affidavit (or, better, Mr. Chauhan should’ve advised Ishan in response to Ishan’s \\nAugust 2023 inquiry). \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 18 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[59]      I also find Shruti’s request that Ishan consent to changing SK’s name concerning. \\nOne inference is that Shruti sought to change SK’s name to make it easier for them to cross \\nthe border. \\n[60]      Shruti responds that, even then, Ishan acquiesced by failing to contact SK after \\nDecember 20th. First, Ishan explained that the period right after their separation was \\ntumultuous: he wasn’t “mentally stable”, he didn’t have steady housing, and he didn’t have \\nmoney. I infer from Ishan’s evidence that he thought he needed a lawyer to see SK, and he \\ndidn’t have the resources to retain a lawyer. That’s a reasonable belief for a newcomer who’s \\nunfamiliar with our parenting laws. \\n[61]      Second, even if Ishan ought to have made efforts to contact SK, he didn’t agree to \\nShruti permanently taking SK to India. There’s no evidence that Shruti advised Ishan that \\nshe was moving to India with SK, or that Ishan tacitly or passively accepted the situation. \\nGiven Shruti’s immigration status, it was reasonable for Ishan to believe that she and SK \\nintended to stay in Canada. \\n3. \\nThe Relevant Links and Circumstances Show that SK’s Habitual \\nResidence is Ontario \\n[62]      There’s some caselaw that section 22(2) of the CLRA provides a complete answer \\nto the determination of habitual residence. See Korutowska-Wooff v Wooff, 2004 CanLII 5548, \\nat para 9 (Ont CA); Logan v Logan, 2022 ONSC 4927, at para 28; Korenic v DePotter, 2022 \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 19 - \\n \\n \\n \\nONSC 3954, at para 22; Markowski v Krochak, 2022 ONSC 2497, at paras 62-66; Mehralian v \\nDunmore, 2023 ONSC 2616, at para 44; and Bakarat v Andraos, 2023 ONSC 582, at para 66.  \\n[63]      In Zafar, the Court of Appeal held that the test for determining a child’s habitual \\nresidence under the Hague Convention in Office of the Children’s Lawyer v Balev, 2018 SCC 16, \\napplies equally to determining a child’s habitual residence under the CLRA. In determining a \\nchild’s habitual residence under Article 3 of the Hague Convention, courts should adopt a \\n“hybrid approach” that looks to “all relevant considerations arising from the facts of the case \\nat hand”, including the child’s situation and the parents’ intentions, especially where the child \\nis an infant. See Balev, at paras 42-47. There’s no “legal test for habitual residence and the list \\nof potentially relevant factors is not closed”. See Balev, at para 47. Each case must be decided \\non its own facts and circumstances.  \\n[64]      Zafar arguably contradicts both the plain words of the CLRA, which defines \\nhabitual residence in a specific non-Hague context, and the Court of Appeal’s earlier decision \\nin Geliedan v Rawdah, 2020 ONCA 254, which found that it was an error for the motion judge \\nto “apply a Hague Convention approach when determining” a CLRA application under section \\n40.4  \\n[65]      In Los v Ross, 2024 ONCA 122, at para 31, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the \\ntest for determining a child’s habitual residence under the CLRA is the “hybrid approach” \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 20 - \\n \\n \\n \\nfrom Balev. In Aldahleh v Zayed, 2024 ONSC 547, Justice Tobin held that the concept of \\nparental intention is captured by section 22(2) (“consent, implied consent or acquiescence”) \\nbut, following Zafar, the court must also consider the “circumstances of the children”.  \\n[66]      In my view, this case shows why a hybrid approach must be used to analyze a child’s \\nhabitual residence. Even though SK was physically present in Ontario when she was last \\nwith both parents, Shruti’s position is that SK never “resided” in Ontario. Again, section \\n22(2) defines “habitual residence” as “the place where the child resided” not the place where \\nthe child was “physically present”. Both sections 22(1)(b)(i) and 23(a) use the words \\n“physically present”, which must mean something different than “resided”. Different words, \\ndifferent meanings. See Agraira v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC \\n36, at para 81. Though “asking and answering where the child last lived during what period \\nof time” is important, other factors are also important. See Zafar, at para 74. \\n[67]      Several relevant facts aren’t disputed: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nShruti, Ishan, and SK are all Indian citizens \\n\\uf0b7 \\nShruti, Ishan, and SK were temporary residents of Canada \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSK was enrolled in an Ontario public school while living in Canada; she’s now \\nenrolled in school in India \\n                                                                                                                                   \\n4 See also Franks & Zalev - This Week in Family Law, Fam L Nws 2024-08 (WL), for a \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 21 - \\n \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSK was in Canada for just over a year \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSK’s grandparents are in India; Shruti has extended family in Canada \\n[68]      Shruti argues that Ishan forced her and SK to move to Canada. In her telling, Ishan \\nwas desperate to move to Canada or the U.S., but he was repeatedly refused a visa. Ishan and \\nhis family then forced Shruti to apply for a student visa, and, when it was granted, to move \\nto Canada. She eventually brought SK to Canada because Ishan and his parents were \\nharassing her. She was blackmailed into sponsoring Ishan. She says that as soon as Ishan \\nsettled in Canada, he moved out against her wishes. \\n[69]      In response, Ishan relies on Mr. Gupta’s evidence that Shruti told him that she was \\n“excited” and “eager” to move to Canada. I don’t find Mr. Gupta’s evidence reliable—his \\naffidavit turns on meeting Shruti at her father’s house and visiting her father’s gas station \\nwhen, in fact, it was her father-in-law’s house and gas station. Mr. Gupta corrected his \\nevidence only after Shruti’s father pointed out the error. Though Mr. Gupta was cross-\\nexamined and credible, I don’t give his evidence any weight.  \\n[70]      Again, I don’t find Shruti’s evidence to be credible. After she and SK moved to India \\nin April 2023, Shruti returned to Ontario for almost six months. She rented a room and \\nfound temporary work. In cross-examination, she testified that she came back to Canada to \\nreconcile with Ishan. But there’s no evidence that she made any substantive efforts to \\n                                                                                                                                   \\ndiscussion of this debate. \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 22 - \\n \\n \\n \\nreconnect with him, never mind reconcile. She says that she tried contacting him through a \\nmutual friend, but she otherwise didn’t have his contact information. On cross-examination, \\nshe admitted having Ishan’s email address but says that email “is not to connect” for \\nreconciliation (she didn’t explain why, especially if this was the only information she had). I \\ndon’t find it believable that Shruti would return to Canada for almost six months, leaving SK \\nin India, in an apparent attempt to reconcile with Ishan but then take no active steps to even \\ncontact him.  \\n[71]      Shruti’s oral evidence is also undermined by her own affidavit: \\n39. \\nMoreover, there was lack of support from Ishan and he \\nabandoned me and my daughter, all this made me decide to move back \\nto India for the sake of my child better future, where she can be looked \\nafter by my parents and I being a single mother can work to financially \\nbe stable to raise my child and provide her with all the necessities. \\n40.  \\nSo, I decided that me and [SK] will stay in India, but in between \\nI will come to Canada to maintain the status for the sake of my \\ndaughter, if in future she would like to come to Canada. \\n[72]      Her affidavit evidence suggests that she’s seeking to maintain her status as a \\npermanent resident of Canada by traveling to Canada from time to time. \\n[73]      Shruti’s explanation also contradicts her affidavit evidence on two other points. First, \\nshe says she went to India because, in December 2022, Ishan said he was going back to \\nIndia. If that was the case, it’s unclear why she returned to Canada in July 2023 to try to \\nreconcile with him here instead of reconnecting with him in India. On one hand, Shruti says \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 23 - \\n \\n \\n \\nthat Ishan had a “craze” to move to North America, to the point that he and his family \\nforced her to immigrate but, on the other hand, he wanted to move back after living here for \\nonly two months. That doesn’t make common sense.  \\n[74]      Second, in her December 2023 affidavit, she states that she went to India in April \\n2023 for her brother’s wedding—that evidence is more consistent with her return to Canada \\nin July 2023. It means her trip in April was a visit to India, not a move from Canada. \\n[75]      Also, Shruti’s Facebook profile from November 2023 describes her as “Enjoying life \\nin Canada”. That public statement is inconsistent with someone who’s only in Canada \\ntemporarily trying to find her husband. \\n[76]      Shruti relies on an affidavit that Ishan made in support of Shruti’s immigration \\napplication: “I further assure you that she will leave Canada on completion of her studies or \\nany time she asked to so by Canadian Immigration Authorities.” Shruti argues that this \\nevidence shows that Ishan knew she was returning to India. I don’t read the affidavit that \\nway—Ishan isn’t foreclosing the possibility that Shruti will get a work permit and stay in \\nCanada (which is exactly what happened). \\n[77]      Shruti raises two other arguments that she says point to India as SK’s habitual \\nresidence. First, she argues that she or her parents have been SK’s primary caregivers since \\nbirth. The parties disagree on who parented SK while Shruti was in Canada from April 2021 \\nto July 2021. Ishan asserts that he cared for SK with the help of his parents. Shruti asserts \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 24 - \\n \\n \\n \\nthat Ishan left SK with her parents almost immediately after she left India, in part because he \\nwas cheating on Shruti. Ishan responds that he left SK with Shruti’s parents for a short \\nperiod when he had COVID, but otherwise parented SK. Because I don’t find Shruti’s \\nevidence to be credible, I reject her view. I find that Ishan was SK’s primary caregiver while \\nShruti was in Canada from April 2021 to July 2021. I find that Shruti and Ishan jointly \\nparented and made decisions for SK before Shruti immigrated to Canada, from July 2021 to \\nMarch 2022 when Shruti visited India after immigrating to Canada, and again from October \\n2022 to December 2022, when Ishan was in Canada.  \\n[78]      Second, in her February affidavit and orally, Shruti asserts that Ishan is only staying \\nin Canada to avoid the legal proceedings against him in India. I believe Ishan’s evidence that \\nthe Indian legal proceedings aren’t relevant to his intention to stay in Canada. Shruti has \\nintroduced no evidence to contradict Ishan’s statement that he hasn’t been served with the \\narrest warrant. I’ve been provided no evidence on the nature of the arrest warrant or the \\nconsequences of the FIR. I can’t assume that these legal proceedings have the same \\nconsequences as they might in Canada without expert evidence about them. Also, this \\nargument contradicts Shruti’s evidence that Ishan had a “craze” to immigrate to Canada.  \\n[79]      In sum, I prefer Ishan’s evidence that he and Shruti made a familial decision to move \\nto Canada. Shruti came to Canada on a student visa, and then supported Ishan coming to \\nCanada as soon as she could do so. I find that Shruti intended to move to Canada and \\nbecome a permanent resident or citizen. The circumstances show that SK’s habitual \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 25 - \\n \\n \\n \\nresidence was Ontario but for Shruti’s unlawful removal. As a result, I find that Ontario has \\njurisdiction to make a parenting order with respect to SK. \\nB. \\nDeclining Jurisdiction Isn’t Appropriate Here \\n[80]      Again, a court having jurisdiction under the CLRA in relation to decision-making \\nresponsibility or parenting time with respect to a child may decline to exercise its jurisdiction \\nif it believes that it’s more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised outside Ontario. See \\nCLRA, s 25.  \\n[81]      Motion judges have identified two tests. First, in Nawasreh v Ahmad, 2023 ONSC \\n1515, at para 40, the court held that section 25 “appears to be a codification of the common \\nlaw doctrine of forum conveniens.” In Club Resorts Inc. v Van Breda, 2012 SCC 17, at para 108, \\nthe party raising the forum issue must show “that the alternative forum is clearly more \\nappropriate and that, in light of the characteristics of the alternative forum, it would be fairer \\nand more efficient to choose an alternative forum and to deny the plaintiff the benefits of \\n[their] decision to select a forum.” The Supreme Court, at paras 110-1, listed several non-\\nexhaustive factors: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nthe locations of parties and witnesses \\n\\uf0b7 \\nthe cost of transferring the case to another jurisdiction or of declining the stay \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 26 - \\n \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nthe effect of a transfer on the conduct of the litigation or on related or parallel \\nproceedings \\n\\uf0b7 \\nthe possibility of conflicting judgments \\n\\uf0b7 \\nproblems related to the recognition and enforcement of judgments \\n\\uf0b7 \\nrelative strengths of the connections of the two parties \\n\\uf0b7 \\nloss of juridical advantage \\n[82]      Second, in several other cases, the court has applied a “balance of convenience” test \\n(like under section 22(1)(b)(vi) of the CLRA), with specific reference to the purposes of Part \\nIII of the CLRA, especially that “it is more appropriate for the matter to be determined by a \\ntribunal having jurisdiction in another place with which the child has a closer connection”. \\nSee CLRA, s 19(b); Barakat v Andraos, 2023 ONSC 582, at paras 69-71; Malpani v Malpani, \\n2022 ONSC 4123, at paras 14-23; Korenic, at paras 36-44; Castillo v Reynoso, 2021 ONSC 680, \\nat paras 49-57; and Cook v Rosenthal, 2021 ONSC 1653, at paras 93-119.  \\n[83]      In these cases, the courts have considered several factors in deciding “closer \\nconnection”: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nthe locations of parties and witnesses \\n\\uf0b7 \\nthe place of the child’s doctor, dentist, school, and extra-curricular activities \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 27 - \\n \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nthe child’s school attendance record \\n\\uf0b7 \\nthe residence of the child’s friends, family, and caregivers \\n\\uf0b7 \\nthe existence of a court order or court filings \\nSee also MAJ v CS, 2006 CanLII 36605, at para 21 (Ont CA), in which the Court of Appeal \\nrelied on some of these factors without expressly identifying a legal test. \\n[84]      In HE v MM, 2015 ONCA 813, at para 82, the Court of Appeal reminded us that \\nthe CLRA mandates a “a child-centered approach based on the best interests of the child in \\ndiscouraging child abduction.” Given that, I don’t believe the “clearly more appropriate” test \\nor the factors used for that test should apply to family law proceedings involving parenting \\ndisputes—children “have no control over where their parents litigate.” See HE, at para 82.  \\n[85]      To that end, I prefer the balance of convenience test, informed by factors that allow \\nthe court to conclude which forum is in a better position to dispose of the parenting issues. \\nThese factors include consideration of the place where the child has a closer connection. \\n[86]      Shruti points to several factors that she says makes India the better forum. The nub \\nof her argument is that she’s started family law proceedings in India and only Indian courts \\ncan give her relief “pertaining to Matrimonial, Dowry, Stridhan (women’s property), \\nharassment and coercion”. In essence, Shruti is making the argument that India is in a \\n“better position” to dispose of this case because she’ll lose a juridical advantage. But Shruti \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 28 - \\n \\n \\n \\nhas led no admissible evidence on Indian law that allows me to determine that India is a \\nmore appropriate forum to litigate the parenting issues. Further, all of Shruti’s other arguments \\nabout forum (i.e., location of witnesses, place of marriage) focus on the matrimonial dispute \\nbetween her and Ishan, not the parenting issues over SK.  \\n[87]      That said, SK has been in India since April 2023—she’s going to school there and \\nher grandparents live there. But these connections arise because Shruti unlawfully abducted \\nSK. If a parent is allowed to wrongfully remove a child from Ontario, settle the child in a \\nnew place, and then successfully argue that the new place is the better forum to litigate \\nparenting issues because the child now has a closer connection to the new place, such a \\nruling would undermine the jurisdiction analysis and risks encouraging child abductions from \\nOntario. See Malpani, at para 18. \\n[88]      As a result, I refuse to exercise my discretion to decline jurisdiction under section 25 \\nof the CLRA. \\nC. \\nThe Appropriate Remedy Is an Order that Shruti Answer the Case \\n[89]      Ishan urges me to make a chasing order. I’m not prepared to do so, in part because \\nI’m not persuaded that I have jurisdiction to make such an order. As discussed above, \\nsection 40 of the CLRA doesn’t apply because SK has been wrongfully removed from \\nOntario. The orders under section 37(3) can be used to “secure the prompt, safe return” of a \\nchild to Ontario but chasing orders aren’t included as possible relief. Section 28(1)(c) allows \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 29 - \\n \\n \\n \\nme to make an order prohibiting a party from removing a child from Ontario without the \\nconsent of another party or an order of the court but that order is incidental to a parenting \\norder.  \\n[90]      I wasn’t provided any statutory authority giving me express jurisdiction to order the \\nreturn of SK to Ontario. \\n[91]      I acknowledge that our court has, in other cases, made chasing orders. See, e.g., \\nMalpani. But I haven’t been provided any caselaw in which the court’s jurisdiction was \\nexpressly considered. Perhaps, in those cases, the respondent consented to a chasing order if \\nthe court found jurisdiction. Ishan asks me to use the court’s parens patriae jurisdiction \\nbecause there’s a gap in the legislation that would entitle the court to make such an order in \\nSK’s best interests. \\n[92]      Even if such a gap existed, I don’t know if ordering Shruti to return SK to Ontario \\nis in SK’s best interests. Perhaps the court will authorize SK’s relocation to India (and order \\nthat Ishan’s exercise of parenting time and decision-making responsibility should reflect SK’s \\nnew place of residence). Again, the motion before me wasn’t to determine SK’s best interests \\non these issues. It would be premature to order Shruti to return SK to Ontario before the \\ncourt has a hearing to determine SK’s best interests. \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 30 - \\n \\n \\n \\n[93]      As a result, the appropriate order is that Shruti should answer the case, and this \\napplication should proceed to trial quickly: \\n \\n(a) \\nShruti shall serve an answer and an affidavit in Form 35.1 on Ishan on or \\nbefore April 17, 2024; and \\n \\n(b) \\nthe parties shall attend a virtual case conference before me on April 23, 2024, \\nat 9am. \\n[94]      The parties should operate on the basis that the trial of this application may be \\nheard during the trial sittings starting May 12, 2024. \\nD. \\nThe Parties Shall Make Costs Submissions If They Can’t Agree \\n[95]      The parties will engage in meaningful discussions and negotiations respecting the \\ncosts of this motion. If they can’t resolve costs, any party seeking costs will serve, file, and \\nupload to CaseLines costs submissions (1000 words), any relevant offers to settle, and their \\nbill of costs by April 9, 2024, 4pm. The other party’s responding submissions (1000 words) \\nwill be served, filed, and uploaded to CaseLines by April 15, 2024, 4pm. \\nIV. \\nCONCLUSION \\n[96]      The breakdown of a marriage is tragic. The heartbreaking end to Ishan’s and \\nShruti’s relationship could only have been made more complicated by their shaky status as \\nnew immigrants to Canada. But, based on the evidence before me, I’ve no doubt that Shruti \\n2024 ONSC 1443 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n- 31 - \\n \\n \\n \\nand Ishan intended to live, with SK, in Canada. By fleeing to India, Shruti has unlawfully \\nabducted SK, in violation of our country’s laws.  \\n[97]      Making matters worse, she’s denied SK her legal right to parenting time with Ishan. \\nParenting time is the child’s right. If Shruti has valid arguments that it’s in SK’s best interests \\nthat they relocate to India, she should make that claim in our courts. \\n  \\n________________________________ \\nJustice R.K.

Sometime after \\n11:00 p.m., they had a physical altercation on the street near the intersection of Jane Street. Mr. \\nNelson stabbed Mr. Shortliffe four times resulting in serious, life-threatening injuries.  \\n[2] \\nMr. Nelson is charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, and assault with a \\nweapon. The defence disputes that the Crown has established the elements of the offence of \\nattempted murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The defence concedes that the Crown has \\ndemonstrated the elements of the offences of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon. \\nHowever, the defence’s position is that Mr. Nelson acted in self-defence. \\n[3] \\nThe Crown’s theory is as follows. Mr. Nelson was angry with Mr. Shortliffe about a \\nperceived racist comment made at the bar. Mr. Nelson waited, with a knife in hand, for Mr. \\nShortliffe to leave the bar. The Crown suggests that Mr. Nelson said something to Mr. Shortliffe \\nas he was leaving the bar, causing Mr. Shortliffe to engage in a physical fight with him. Mr. Nelson \\nthen stabbed Mr. Shortliffe four times near his heart and lungs with an intent to kill him. The \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nCrown’s position is that Mr. Nelson must have had the knife ready when Mr. Shortliffe passed him \\nbecause he would not otherwise have been able to stab him so quickly and devastatingly. The \\nCrown submits that there is no air of reality to the claim of self-defence, and that Mr. Nelson used \\nexcessive force against Mr. Shortliffe. \\n[4] \\nThe defence’s position is that it was Mr. Shortliffe who ambushed Mr. Nelson as Mr. \\nNelson left the bar. Before Mr. Nelson could resist, Mr. Shortliffe took him to the ground and \\npunched him repeatedly in the head. After approximately eight blows, Mr. Nelson retrieved a \\npocketknife from his bag and began to stab Mr. Shortliffe to stop the beating and to get away. \\nIssues \\n[5] \\nThe issues raised in the case are as follows: \\n \\nHas the Crown demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Nelson intended \\nto kill Mr. Shortliffe? \\n \\nHas the Crown demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Nelson did not \\nact in self-defence? \\nAnalysis \\nThe Applicable Principles \\n[6] \\nMr. Nelson is presumed innocent. The Crown bears the burden of proving the elements \\nof the offences charged beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a high standard. It is not sufficient to \\nprove that the defendant is probably guilty. However, the Crown is not required to prove its case \\nto the point of absolute certainty, which would be impossibly high.  \\n[7] \\nIf I find that the defence has shown an air of reality with respect to self-defence, then the \\nonus is on the Crown to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of the elements \\nof self-defence could not be established. \\n[8] \\nBefore proceeding with an examination of the evidence, it is useful to set out the \\nprinciples that are applied by the court in weighing the evidence. In assessing the evidence, because \\nMr. Nelson testified in his defence, this court must follow the approach set out by the Supreme \\nCourt of Canada in R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. The W.(D.) analysis, as applicable to this \\ncase, would be articulated as follows: \\n(i) \\nIf the court believes Mr. Nelson’s evidence, he must be acquitted; \\n(ii) \\nIf the court does not believe Mr. Nelson’s evidence, but it leaves the court with a \\nreasonable doubt, he must be acquitted; and \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n(iii) Even if Mr. Nelson’s evidence does not leave me with a reasonable doubt, the court \\nmay only find the defendant guilty if the court is persuaded that the Crown proves \\nthe charges beyond a reasonable doubt. \\n[9] \\nIn applying the W.(D.) analysis, Mr. Nelson’s evidence is not to be considered in isolation, \\nbut in the context of the evidence as a whole. In this case, the defence acknowledged that even if \\nI believed Mr. Nelson’s evidence, because of his memory gaps, this would be insufficient to acquit. \\nUncontested Facts  \\n[10] \\nOn the night of August 2, 2018, Mr. Nelson went to a bar, the Station, on Bloor Street \\nWest near Jane Street. He was sitting inside at the bar. \\n[11] \\nMr. Shortliffe was also at the Station on August 2, 2018. He had gone there with a friend, \\nJulia MacDowall. They were sitting at a table on the patio outside the bar. They ordered a number \\nof drinks and some food.  \\n[12] \\nSometime after 11:00 p.m., Mr. Shortliffe and Ms. MacDowall decided to leave the \\nStation. Mr. Shortliffe had a cigarette while he waited for Ms. MacDowall, who went to the \\nwashroom inside the Station.  \\n[13] \\nAt some point during the evening, employees of the Station cut Mr. Nelson off from \\nfurther alcohol. Mr. Nelson did not dispute being cut off and paid his bill. After speaking to some \\nother regular patrons, he left the bar. \\n[14] \\nA physical altercation between Mr. Nelson and Mr. Shortliffe took place on the south side \\nof Bloor Street West near the intersection of Jane Street. The altercation was captured by a video \\nsurveillance camera at a restaurant at 2422 Bloor Street West, to the east and north of the location \\nof the fight. It is undisputed that Paul Nelson and Pierre Shortliffe are the two men seen in the \\nvideo. The camera was approximately 70 metres from where the fight took place. The recording \\nthat is in evidence is in fact a cellphone video of the video as it was being played on a monitor at \\nthe restaurant. It was agreed between the parties that the video was so fuzzy that it was zoomed in \\nto capture the incident. \\n[15] \\nAfter the altercation, Mr. Shortliffe walked back to the Station patio. Eyewitnesses saw \\nthat he was bleeding in the chest area. Someone called 911 and Ms. MacDowall used her clothing \\nas compresses to stop the bleeding. Once the paramedics arrived, Mr. Shortliffe was taken to a \\nhospital. \\n[16] \\nAt the hospital, Mr. Shortliffe was placed in a medically-induced coma for two days. Mr. \\nShortliffe suffered multiple injuries. He had been stabbed in the chest area three times and in the \\nback once. One wound nicked his heart. The stab wound to his back punctured his lung. He had \\n72 stitches to close a wound from his neck to his chest. Mr. Shortliffe also had injuries to his \\nfingers, including a severed tendon, which required surgery to repair. He does not have full \\nmovement of his finger. He was in hospital for approximately six weeks. Mr. Shortliffe was on \\npain medication and blood thinners while in the hospital. \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[17] \\nLater that night, Officer Kim Truong of the Toronto Police Service and her partner located \\nMr. Nelson in an alleyway off Durie Street, not far from the Station bar. Mr. Nelson complied with \\npolice directions. He had blood on his face and behind his left ear. His shirt was blood-stained. \\nThe police called paramedics who cleared Mr. Nelson medically. He was then taken to the police \\nstation. At the station, Mr. Nelson’s injuries were photographed. They included abrasions to his \\nelbows, and some bruises and scratch marks on his chest. \\n[18] \\nEarly the next morning, Officer Todd Hall located a knife in a planter on the patio of a \\nTimothy’s coffee shop on Bloor Street West and Armadale Avenue, approximately 80-100 metres \\nfrom Bryden’s pub, which was next door to the Station.  \\n[19] \\nMr. Nelson admitted that the knife belonged to him. The knife is a folding pocketknife \\nwith a four-inch handle. The blade, which is three and a quarter inches long, was partially serrated. \\nThe knife is not a prohibited weapon.  \\n[20] \\nA blood sample taken from the knife matched the DNA sample provided by Mr. \\nShortliffe. A DNA sample of blood swabbed from behind Mr. Nelson’s ear was also found to \\nmatch that of Mr. Shortliffe.  \\nThe Evidence \\n[21] \\nIn weighing the evidence, I must assess the credibility and reliability of the witnesses’ \\nevidence. This involves considering the internal consistency of each witness’s testimony and its \\nconsistency in the context of the evidence as a whole.  \\nThe Video Recording \\n[22] \\nAs noted above, the altercation between Mr. Nelson and Mr. Shortlife was captured on \\nvideo. The video was taken at a distance and is of very poor quality. The quality of the video \\nrecording does not improve when it is slowed down because the image becomes even more \\ndistorted.  \\n[23] \\nOn the video, the heavier individual, Mr. Nelson, is seen walking. He turns slightly and \\nis tripped, then spun and taken to the ground by the slimmer individual, who is Mr. Shortliffe. \\nThey fall to the ground together. Mr. Shortliffe then gets on top of Mr. Nelson and punches him in \\nthe head in a rapid and relentless manner. Over the course of 10 seconds, 14 blows are seen. Mr. \\nNelson appears to be struggling underneath Mr. Shortliffe. He is holding up a black item, which is \\nhis bag, as if to shield himself. After 8 to 10 punches, Mr. Nelson’s arm can be seen moving up \\nand down. The defence submits that this is when Mr. Nelson stabbed Mr. Shortliffe.  \\n[24] \\nMr. Shortliffe gets up first. He stomps his foot on something and then drags Mr. Nelson \\nby the arm toward the curb. Mr. Shortliffe then walks away, westward, but looks unsteady on his \\nfeet. Mr. Nelson gets up. He has his bag in his hands. He bends down to pick something up, which \\nis likely his hat. He then walks away slowly in the opposite direction of Mr. Shortliffe.   \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nJulia MacDowall \\n[25] \\nAt the time of the incident, Ms. MacDowall was a friend of Mr. Shortliffe’s. He was a \\nregular at a bar where Ms. MacDowall worked. It was Ms. MacDowall’s idea to go to the Station \\nbar that night because they had live music and cheap drinks. Ms. MacDowall testified that Mr. \\nShortliffe drove them both to the bar. They were there for approximately two to three hours that \\nnight. They sat at a table on the patio, drank beer and ate some food.  \\n[26] \\nMs. MacDowall testified that on one occasion, when she went into the bar to use the \\nwashroom, a man who was sitting at the bar blocked her way and told her that she and her \\n“boyfriend” or her “man” were not welcome at his bar. Ms. MacDowall responded that Mr. \\nShortliffe was not her “man.” An employee of the bar, Dilara, then told the man to back off and \\ncalm down. She got him to sit back down on the bar stool. Ms. MacDowall did not recall seeing \\nthe man before that interaction. The individual she described was dressed as Mr. Nelson was \\ndressed that night, in a Blue Jays’ baseball cap and plaid shirt. Ms. MacDowall testified that when \\nshe returned to the table and told Mr. Shortliffe that a guy at the bar tried to stop her from going \\nto the bathroom, Mr. Shortliffe told her the same guy bothered him when he went for a smoke.1 \\n[27] \\nMs. MacDowall and Mr. Shortliffe were going to leave when Ms. MacDowall again went \\ninto the Station to use the washroom. Mr. Shortliffe went to have a cigarette. Ms. MacDowall \\ntestified that she saw Mr. Shortliffe walk in the direction of the Pizza Pizza, which was east of the \\nStation. Ms. MacDowall testified that she had taken Mr. Shortliffe’s car keys from him and was \\ngoing to call an Uber.  \\n[28] \\nMs. MacDowall returned from the washroom to find Mr. Shortliffe slouched in a chair on \\nthe patio. He was slurring his words and bleeding. Ms. MacDowall opened Mr. Shortliffe’s shirt \\nto see where the blood was coming from and observed three stab wounds in the upper chest area \\nnear Mr. Shortliffe’s heart. Ms. MacDowall took off her clothes to use as a compress. Ms. \\nMacDowall tried to keep Mr. Shortliffe calm and conscious while waiting for the ambulance to \\narrive.  \\n[29] \\nMs. MacDowall did not see the altercation between Mr. Shortliffe and Mr. Nelson. She \\ndid not see Mr. Shortliffe get stabbed. When she was shown the video of the altercation, she \\ntestified that she did not recognize the individual punching the other man as Mr. Shortliffe. She \\ntestified that it would be “extremely out of character” for Mr. Shortliffe, whom she described as a \\n“savvy French man.” \\n[30] \\nMs. MacDowall was a credible witness. She was candid and answered questions in a \\nforthright manner.  She did not overstate her evidence and acknowledged when she did not know \\nor recall something. At one point, Ms. MacDowall corrected her earlier testimony and stated that \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 This is a hearsay statement and was not admitted for the truth of its contents and I do not rely on it for the truth of \\nits contents. \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nshe may have exaggerated at first. This was in relation to the amount of blood she initially saw on \\nMr. Shortliffe’s shirt, which she at first described as a “tiny dot” that grew to cover the whole side \\nof his shirt. Ms. MacDowall conceded that there was more blood initially than a tiny dot. She \\nadmitted that both she and Mr. Shortliffe had a lot to drink that night. Ms. MacDowall testified \\nthat while she spoke to Mr. Shortliffe in the past, they were no longer in touch because it was \\ndifficult not to discuss the incident with Mr. Nelson. While Ms. MacDowall tried to portray Mr. \\nShortliffe in a positive light, in my view, she was sincere when she testified that she did not \\nrecognize Mr. Shortliffe on the video. Despite having seen Mr. Shortliffe drunk in the past, she \\nhad not previously seen him behave in an aggressive manner.  \\nScott Penfold \\n[31] \\nScott Penfold was a bartender at the Station. By August 2018, he had worked there for \\napproximately one year and knew Mr. Nelson, who came into the bar approximately three times a \\nweek. Mr. Penfold testified that he spoke to Mr. Nelson often and that they had a “cordial” \\nrelationship, but that Mr. Nelson would sometimes get “aggravated” by other people’s behaviour. \\nMr. Penfold testified that Mr. Nelson could be “abrasive” when someone rubbed him the wrong \\nway but that he had never seen him behave in a physically aggressive manner.  \\n[32] \\nMr. Penfold testified that on the night of August 2, 2018, Mr. Nelson told him that another \\nman at the Station had made a comment to him, about whether someone like him was allowed to \\ndrink alcohol. Mr. Nelson pointed in the direction of the person who made the comment, who Mr. \\nPenfold recalled was a tall slim man who was sitting on the patio with a woman with brown hair.  \\n[33] \\nMr. Penfold testified that as the night went on, Mr. Nelson seemed to get more \\n“frustrated” about the interaction. Mr. Penfold spoke to Dilara, the waitress, and they decided that \\nMr. Nelson should not be served any further alcohol to avoid adding “more gas on the fire.” \\nAnother Station employee who was at the bar but not working that night, Walter, had been sitting \\nnext to Mr. Nelson. Walter also suggested to Mr. Penfold that Mr. Nelson be cut off. Mr. Penfold \\ntestified that when he gave Mr. Nelson the bill, he paid without any issue and that they both laughed \\nabout the comment that the other man had made. Mr. Penfold estimated that in the past year, he \\nhad cut off Mr. Nelson approximately five times. \\n[34] \\nLater on, Mr. Penfold was having a cigarette break outside behind the bar when another \\nemployee told him that someone had been stabbed. He ran through the bar to the patio and saw \\nMr. Shortliffe bleeding and Ms. MacDowall attending to him. Mr. Penfold testified that he \\nrecognized Mr. Shortliffe as the man whom Mr. Nelson had pointed out earlier. \\n[35] \\nI find Mr. Penfold’s testimony to be both credible and reliable. Although he knew Mr. \\nNelson as a regular at the bar, there was no evidence to suggest that they remain friends or are in \\ntouch. He was not involved in the incident between Mr. Nelson and Mr. Shortliffe. Mr. Penfold \\nanswered the questions about Mr. Nelson’s behaviour that night and in the past in a candid manner. \\nHe remembered details like the type of bag Mr. Nelson carried. Mr. Penfold corrected his \\ntestimony when presented contradictory evidence. For example, he first estimated that he cut Mr. \\nNelson off between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m., but when presented with evidence of the timing of the \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n911 call, he corrected himself to say that it was likely closer to 11:00 or 11:15 that he cut Mr. \\nNelson off.  \\nPierre Shortliffe \\n[36] \\nMr. Shortliffe testified that he and Ms. MacDowall went to the Station at approximately \\n9 p.m. on August 2, 2018. They were sitting at a table on the patio.  \\n[37] \\nAt some point, Mr. Shortliffe went into the restaurant to use the washroom. On his way \\nout, he ordered two beers from the bartender and carried them outside. Mr. Shortliffe testified that \\nat that point, a waitress said something like, “I hope this guy is not bothering you.” Mr. Shortliffe \\nrecalled that Ms. MacDowall told him that a guy at the bar physically prevented her from going to \\nthe washroom and told her not to bring her boyfriend to the bar. Ms. MacDowall pointed out the \\nindividual who spoke to her. Mr. Shortliffe testified that she pointed to one of four or five people \\nat the bar. The person was wearing a hat. \\n[38] \\nMr. Shortliffe testified that he had no interaction with Mr. Nelson. Mr. Shortliffe denied \\nmaking any comment to Mr. Nelson, whether racist or otherwise. \\n[39] \\nMr. Shortliffe testified at trial that after he and Ms. MacDowall decided to leave, he was \\nstanding on the sidewalk in front of the Station patio smoking a cigarette while waiting for her to \\nuse the washroom. Mr. Shortliffe testified that it was then that Mr. Nelson came out of the bar and \\nstabbed him. Mr. Shortliffe testified that Mr. Nelson had a knife in his hand and put it in the centre \\nof Mr. Shortliffe’s chest. Mr. Nelson said two words to him, which he does not recall. Mr. Nelson \\nthen took the knife out and stabbed him again. Mr. Shortliffe recalled trying to catch the blade as \\nit went through his chest again. He recalls trying to hold it while Mr. Nelson kept pushing harder \\nand harder. Mr. Shortliffe testified that Mr. Nelson’s face was very close to him, and his expression \\nwas very angry. Mr. Nelson then stabbed him again in the left shoulder area. Mr. Shortliffe testified \\nthat when he fell to his knees, Mr. Nelson stabbed him again on the left side of his back. Mr. \\nShortliffe testified that this took place “immediately in front of the Station.”  \\n[40] \\nMr. Shortliffe testified that after he fell to his knees, he looked up and saw the person \\nwalking away eastbound on Bloor Street. He got up and chased Mr. Nelson on Bloor Street a little \\npast the Pizza Pizza. Mr. Shortliffe testified that he was “outraged” that the person who stabbed \\nhim was disappearing into the darkness. Mr. Shortliffe testified that they got into a fight there on \\nthe street, where the physical altercation is captured on video. He testified that he noticed that the \\nfight had spilled into the street. After punching Mr. Nelson, he dragged him on the ground to \\nremove him from the path of vehicles turning onto Bloor Street. Mr. Shortliffe admitted that he is \\nthe individual seen walking away on the video recording.  \\n[41] \\nMr. Shortliffe testified that he then went back to the patio at the Station. Mr. Shortliffe \\ntestified that he felt “fine” and wanted to go. Ms. MacDowall came out of the bar and began to \\nattend to his wounds. \\n[42] \\nOn cross-examination, defence counsel put to Mr. Shortliffe that he had an alcohol \\naddiction, which he denied.  Mr. Shortliffe admitted that while recovering in the hospital, he spoke \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nto a psychotherapist about his drinking because he was distraught at the pain he had put his family \\nthrough. He testified that he realized that he needed to stay away from bars, because “bad things \\nhappen.” Mr. Shortliffe acknowledged that he drank a significant amount of beer multiple times a \\nweek.  \\n[43] \\nMr. Shortliffe was also asked whether he recalled telling the psychotherapist at the \\nhospital that he drank to overcome the trauma of an incident that took place during his childhood. \\nMr. Shortliffe did not recall having told the psychotherapist but admitted that while he was a child \\nin France, he had experienced a traumatic incident at the hands of a man who was of Algerian \\norigin. Mr. Shortliffe objected to the use of his discussion with the psychotherapist, which he had \\nunderstood to be confidential. This was an extremely sensitive and private subject matter that was \\nunderstandably difficult for Mr. Shortliffe. Defence counsel approached this area of questioning \\nwith great caution and asked no more questions than necessary. I do not wish to cause Mr. \\nShortliffe further distress. However, I refer to this evidence because it is relevant to the factual \\nfindings that I make further in these reasons.   \\nCredibility and Reliability \\n[44] \\nPrior to the trial, Mr. Shortliffe had provided a statement to the police in August 2018, an \\ninterview with the CBC shortly thereafter and testimony at the preliminary inquiry in March 2020. \\nIt was only at trial that Mr. Shortliffe testified, for the first time, that he had been stabbed before \\nthe physical fight. On the previous occasions, Mr. Shortliffe had said that the physical fight took \\nplace before the stabbing. \\n[45] \\nMr. Shortliffe admitted that his account of the incident between Mr. Nelson and himself \\nhas changed, between his initial police statement, the subsequent CBC interview, his testimony at \\nthe preliminary inquiry and his testimony at trial. However, he disputes that each version varies \\nsignificantly from the other.   \\n[46] \\nOn cross-examination, Mr. Shortliffe admitted that in his police statement, he described \\na brief physical altercation with a young, Middle Eastern man with an accent, who was wearing a \\nblack track suit and was sitting on a bench outside the bicycle shop, a few doors east of the Station. \\nThe young man called him over toward the bench and punched him for no reason. Mr. Shortliffe \\ndescribed punching the man a couple of times and finding the man odd because he was smiling. \\nMr. Shortliffe admitted that he told police that he did not remember the stabbing but was likely \\nstabbed by that man. When cross-examined about this account, Mr. Shortliffe stated that when he \\ngave the statement to police, he had just come out of a coma, was on pain medication, and was \\nconfused and trying to piece together what had happened. Mr. Shortliffe admitted that he did not \\nknow whether what he told the police happened or not.  \\n[47] \\nMr. Shortliffe was also cross-examined about the account that he gave a CBC reporter \\napproximately one week after his police statement. At that time, he told the reporter that when he \\nwas leaving the Station, a stranger approached him, yelled something, brandished a weapon and \\nthen stabbed him. \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[48] \\nMr. Shortliffe further admitted that at the preliminary inquiry, he testified that a Middle \\nEastern man in his 20s with a thick accent and full beard called him over toward a bench and then \\npunched him. Mr. Shortliffe then threw the person to the ground and punched him one or two \\ntimes. Mr. Shortliffe testified then that he was certain that he was not injured after the physical \\naltercation and that he was stabbed by a different individual when he returned to the Station patio.   \\n[49] \\nIt was at the preliminary inquiry that Mr. Shortliffe viewed the video recording for the \\nfirst time. At trial, Mr. Shortliffe testified that when he first saw the video, he did not recognize it, \\nand he did not remember that he got into a fight with Mr. Nelson. Mr. Shortliffe testified that he \\ncan no longer say whether the other person, the young Middle Eastern man in the track suit, existed \\nor not. At trial, Mr. Shortliffe speculated that there were two fights, one with Mr. Nelson and one \\nwith the other individual. \\n[50] \\nIt is clear from Mr. Shortliffe’s testimony that he continues to try to make sense of what \\nhappened that night. Mr. Shortliffe described trying to piece together what happened to him with \\neach new detail that he learns. Mr. Shortliffe explained that his memories were “unlocked” over \\ntime and that his memory “evolved” as he received additional information. \\n[51] \\nFor a number of reasons, I find Mr. Shortliffe’s evidence entirely unreliable. Not only has \\nMr. Shortliffe’s version of the incident changed significantly over time, on each occasion and \\ndespite the significant differences, Mr. Shortliffe expresses absolute certainty about his \\nrecollection of the incident. On cross-examination, Mr. Shortliffe admitted that had the trial been \\nheld at any of those previous occasions, immediately after his police statement, after the CBC \\ninterview, or after the preliminary inquiry, he would have testified to the account he gave at the \\ntime and he would have been certain that it was true.  \\n[52] \\nThe one consistent thread among Mr. Shortliffe’s various accounts is that he was stabbed \\non the sidewalk in front of the Station patio. However, it is not possible that the incident occurred \\nas Mr. Shortliffe describes it. Mr. Shortliffe’s evidence is completely inconsistent with the \\nevidence of the eyewitnesses. Chantal Forde, Amber Trollope and Stephanie Weese were all seated \\non the patio at Bryden’s pub next door to the Station. None of them saw an individual get stabbed \\nnear the patio area. None of them saw Mr. Shortliffe chase Mr. Nelson from the patio to the \\nintersection of Bloor Street West and Jane Street. None of them testified to seeing Mr. Shortliffe \\nbleeding while the altercation was going on. They all saw an altercation or incident between two \\nmen at the intersection by the Pizza Pizza. They all saw an individual, Mr. Shortliffe, return to the \\nStation patio with blood appearing in the chest area of his shirt.  \\n[53] \\nMoreover, had Mr. Nelson stabbed Mr. Shortliffe outside the Station patio, he would not \\nhave been able to then chase Mr. Nelson to the intersection of Bloor Street West and Jane Street, \\ntackle him and then punch him 14 times. Given the nature and location of the stab wounds, it is \\nunlikely that Mr. Shortliffe would have been physically able to perform those acts. He would have \\nbeen bleeding profusely. Ms. MacDowall, Ms. Trollope, Ms. Forde and Ms. Weese describe seeing \\nMr. Shortliffe when he returned to the Station patio. He was bleeding, pale, and in a state of shock. \\nHad the stabbing taken place before the physical altercation, it is likely that Mr. Shortliffe would \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nhave been bleeding, pale and in shock at that time. He would not have been in a condition that \\nwould enable him to fight Mr. Nelson as he did. \\n[54] \\nIt is also implausible that after being stabbed, Mr. Shortliffe, who was unarmed, would \\ngo after a person he knew to be armed. In addition, if the stabbing took place before the physical \\naltercation, it is likely that Mr. Nelson would have used the knife sooner and before allowing Mr. \\nShortliffe to punch him in the head repeatedly.  \\n[55] \\nIn my view, Mr. Shortliffe’s memory is also impaired because of his level of intoxication \\nthat night. He was found to have a blood alcohol content of 209 milligrams, which is more than \\ntwo and a half times over the legal limit of 80 milligrams. Mr. Shortliffe nonetheless testified that \\nhe was “fine” that night and planned to drive home. Mr. Shortliffe denied that he was intoxicated \\nand did not recall that Ms. MacDowall had taken his car keys.   \\n[56] \\nMore significantly, the stabbing was an extremely traumatic event for Mr. Shortliffe. It \\ntook place over five years ago. It is not surprising that Mr. Shortliffe’s memory of the incident has \\nchanged over time. While Mr. Shortliffe described his memories as being “unlocked” with each \\nnew fact, it is difficult to know the difference between the unlocking of a memory and the brain \\nfilling in a gap. \\n[57] \\nSince viewing the video for the first time at the preliminary inquiry, Mr. Shortliffe appears \\nto have grappled with his own violent acts as recorded on the video. On cross-examination, Mr. \\nShortliffe asked, “How do you explain that I come running up the sidewalk and jump on Paul \\nNelson, a person I’ve never met in my life before for no reason apparently unprovoked and suplex \\nhim on the sidewalk and throw 14 punches into his head. I’m clearly very upset with this person \\nabout something.” His account at trial, that the stabbing took place before he attacked Mr. Nelson, \\nwould provide an explanation for his anger.   \\n[58] \\nOn cross-examination, Mr. Shortliffe testified that Crown counsel and the officer-in-\\ncharge (OIC), Candy Graham, told him before the preliminary inquiry that there was a video \\nrecording of the fight and that if that was when he was stabbed, Mr. Nelson would claim self-\\ndefence. It was agreed between the Crown and defence, through an agreed statement of facts, that \\nneither Crown counsel nor the OIC ever advised Mr. Shortliffe what Mr. Nelson’s defence would \\nbe but only what possible defences could be anticipated. I mention this as a demonstration of the \\nextent to which Mr. Shortliffe was prepared to improvise his evidence. This also explains to some \\nextent Mr. Shortliffe’s more recent version of the incident, that the stabbing took place before the \\nphysical altercation, which would negate Mr. Nelson’s claim of self-defence.  \\n[59] \\nThe Crown conceded that Mr. Shortliffe was a “problematic witness” and that he was \\nprone to “confabulation.” The Crown submitted that it could not urge one version over another \\nbased on Mr. Shortliffe’s testimony alone. Nonetheless, the Crown argued in closing that the \\nversion Mr. Shortliffe testified to at trial accords with the evidence. As explained further in these \\nreasons, I cannot agree. \\n[60] \\nIn my view, Mr. Shortliffe did not intend to mislead the court or to give false testimony. \\nHis attempts to make sense of what happened to him that night are genuine. However, Mr. \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nShortliffe’s tendency to give answers when he in fact does not know the answer, his reluctance to \\nadmit that he does not know, and his professed certainty in his testimony cannot help but affect \\nmy assessment of his credibility. Mr. Shortliffe’s filling in the blanks to come to grips with what \\nhappened that night, while understandable, does not constitute evidence of the facts. \\n[61] \\nFor the foregoing reasons, unless corroborated by other evidence, Mr. Shortliffe’s \\ntestimony is too problematic to be accepted as evidence of what took place between him and Mr. \\nNelson on August 2, 2018. \\nThe Eyewitnesses \\n[62] \\nThe Crown called three eyewitnesses. None had any interest in the proceeding or any \\nmotive to fabricate evidence. Although there were some minor inconsistencies with the video \\nrecording, they were not material. Their testimony was largely consistent with each other. I find \\nall three witnesses both credible and reliable.  \\nChantal Forde \\n[63] \\nAt approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 2, 2018, Ms. Forde was on the patio of Bryden’s \\npub with her husband. At the time, Bryden’s pub was on the east side of the Station where Mr. \\nShortliffe and Ms. MacDowall were having drinks. Approximately 30 minutes after arriving, Ms. \\nForde observed two men fighting in the street, in the intersection. Ms. Forde testified that she saw \\nthe “slighter” man on top of the heavier man punching him several times. She did not see the \\nheavier man punch the other man. Ms. Forde turned to tell her husband to call 911 because she \\nwas concerned about the man who was being hit. However, when she turned back, the fight was \\nover. The heavier man got up, put his bag over his shoulder and began to walk east. The other man \\nwalked back toward the Station. As he got closer, she saw blood coming through his shirt on the \\nleft side.  \\nStephanie Weese \\n[64] \\nOn the night of August 2, 2018, Ms. Weese was on the patio of Bryden’s pub with her \\nfriend, Amber Trollope. Ms. Weese was facing the street and Ms. Trollope was facing the \\nrestaurant. At some point, Ms. Weese saw two men on the ground and assumed there had been an \\naccident. Ms. Weese did not see the altercation or stabbing. She saw the heavier man who was \\nwearing a plaid shirt and shorts get up and put his hat back on and put his bag over his body. He \\nwalked away slowly. Ms. Weese noticed that he had blood on his face. The slimmer male also got \\nup and started walking toward the patio. It was then that Ms. Weese noticed blood coming out \\nfrom his chest area onto his shirt.  \\n[65] \\nBefore the altercation, Ms. Weese had seen Mr. Shortliffe in the area in front of the Pizza \\nPizza. Ms. Weese testified that patrons of both bars were congregating in front of the Pizza Pizza \\nto smoke. \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nAmber Trollope \\n[66] \\nOn the night of August 2, 2018, Ms. Trollope was on the patio of Bryden’s pub with her \\nfriend, Stephanie Weese. Ms. Trollope’s attention was drawn to the altercation between two men \\nby something Ms. Weese said. Ms. Trollope saw the two men in the midst of falling. However, \\nshe did not recall seeing any punching. Ms. Trollope testified that after the two men got back up, \\nthe larger man walked away at a normal pace. The smaller man had blood on the left upper chest \\nportion of his shirt. Ms. Trollope saw the spot growing and realized that he had been injured. Ms. \\nTrollope testified that he looked dazed and shocked.   \\n[67] \\nMs. Trollope had noticed Mr. Shortliffe and Ms. MacDowall on the Station patio earlier \\nin the evening. She testified that they seemed to be having a good time. Ms. Trollope did not recall \\nnoticing Mr. Nelson at any point. She testified that she did not observe any conflict or disagreement \\non the patio or in front of the Pizza Pizza. \\nThe Police Witnesses \\n[68] \\nThe evidence of the police witnesses was largely uncontroversial. As noted in the \\nundisputed facts, Officer Kim Truong located and arrested Mr. Nelson and brought him to the \\nstation. Officer Truong took the photographs of Mr. Nelson showing his injuries and of his \\nclothing. Officer Truong took a sample of the blood that was located behind Mr. Nelson’s ear. She \\nlater provided this to Detective Constable Robert Jitta for testing. \\n[69] \\nOfficer Todd Hall discovered the pocketknife that Mr. Nelson discarded in a planter on \\nthe patio of a Timothy’s coffee shop. He testified to the type of knife it was and how it opens. \\n[70] \\nOfficer Jitta is the Forensic Identification Services officer who took photographs at the \\nscene of the stabbing. Officer Jitta also photographed the pocketknife where Officer Hall had \\nlocated it. He sent the knife to the Centre of Forensic Science for testing. \\nPaul Nelson \\n[71] \\nMr. Nelson was the sole witness for the defence. He testified that he and his spouse, \\nNatasha, were regulars at the Station and were known to employees of the bar. They went there \\napproximately two to three times per week. \\n[72] \\nIn August 2018, Mr. Nelson was employed at Humber Valley hospital preparing \\noperating rooms for surgery. He had an additional position with a medical devices company. \\n[73] \\nMr. Nelson testified that he carried a knife with him because he would use it to open \\npackaging that the medical supplies came in. Mr. Nelson explained that while there were box \\ncutters at work, they would frequently go missing and not be available when needed. He used the \\nknife approximately three to four times a day opening packages. When he was at work, he had the \\nknife clipped to his scrubs or in a pocket. When he was not at work he put it in his bag so that it \\nwould not get lost.  \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[74] \\nOn August 2, 2018, he worked until 3 p.m. and then went home. After having dinner with \\nNatasha, Mr. Nelson went to the Station alone. He sat at the bar beside Walter, a Station employee \\nwho was not working that night. \\n[75] \\nMr. Nelson testified that at some point, a male and a female whom he did not know made \\na comment to him about “my kind” drinking. He did not know what they meant by his “kind” but \\nhe believed the comment to be racist. Mr. Nelson testified that “it was just unfortunate, that it \\nsounded more of like an Islamic comment or something.” It is unclear what words were said that \\nMr. Nelson interpreted as racist or Islamophobic. Mr. Nelson testified that he was upset by the \\ncomment, which he found very offensive. He recalled saying something like, “if you don’t like the \\nway I look, you can fuck off.” At the time, nothing further took place between Mr. Nelson and the \\ntwo individuals. \\n[76] \\nMr. Nelson testified that Walter told him to calm down. Mr. Nelson was presented with \\nhis bill and told that he would not be served any more alcohol. Mr. Nelson testified, as Mr. Penfold \\nhad, that while he was paying the bill, they talked about the comment that was made and laughed \\nit off. Mr. Nelson had a total of about five pints of beer that night. \\n[77] \\nMr. Nelson did not recall making a comment to Ms. MacDowall or Mr. Shortliffe about \\ntheir not being welcome at his bar. \\n[78] \\nAfter paying his bill, Mr. Nelson greeted some of the other regular patrons and left the \\nStation. He was walking east toward the subway station when he felt a punch on the right side of \\nhis head. He was then thrown “violently” to the ground, landing on his elbow. Mr. Nelson testified \\nthat he remembered punches and then it stopped. Mr. Nelson testified that he felt excruciating pain \\nin the back of his head and on his left elbow where he landed. Mr. Nelson testified that he did not \\nrecall anyone saying anything to him and did not see anyone coming. Mr. Nelson denied that he \\nwas waiting for Mr. Shortliffe to leave the bar. \\n[79] \\nWhen asked what he remembered about the fight, Mr. Nelson testified that he could not \\nremember much, just being on the pavement and fearing for his life. He felt “disoriented, shocked \\nand scared.” Mr. Nelson does not recall taking the knife out of his bag or stabbing Mr. Shortliffe. \\nEven after being shown the video, Mr. Nelson testified that he did not recall that happening. When \\nhis attention was drawn to a pumping movement of his arm, Mr. Nelson testified that he did not \\nrecall doing that.  \\n[80] \\nAfter Mr. Shortliffe got off Mr. Nelson, he testified that he felt disoriented, with a burning \\nsensation in his elbow and pain in the back of his head. Mr. Nelson testified that his head felt like \\nhe had a concussion. Mr. Nelson testified that he did not recall what happened other than that a \\npolice car came, he was handcuffed and there was a paramedic crew.  Mr. Nelson testified that he \\ndoes not recall discarding the knife in a planter next to a Timothy’s coffee shop. He does not recall \\ncalling 911, which he did before his arrest. \\n[81] \\nIn the recording of the 911 call, Mr. Nelson tells the 911 operator that he was just \\n“attacked by an idiot at Jane and Bloor… outside of a bar called Bryden’s.” He said he was walking \\nthere to see if the person was still there. Mr. Nelson stated that he thought it was race-related \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nbecause the person talked about “my kind” not being at the bar. Mr. Nelson said that he “fought \\nback.” When the 911 operator asked if could describe the person, Mr. Nelson responded that he \\ndid not know what the person looked like. Mr. Nelson said that he had to go because he thought \\nhe was bleeding. When the 911 operator told him that there were a lot of police at Bloor and Jane, \\nMr. Nelson hung up. He did not go back to Bloor and Jane. At trial, Mr. Nelson admitted that it \\nwas his voice on the recording, but he did not recall having made the call. \\n[82] \\nContrary to the defence’s submission, I find that Mr. Nelson sounds coherent on the \\nrecording of the 911 call. While he expresses confusion about what just happened, he speaks \\nclearly and is not audibly agitated. At the same time, Mr. Nelson did not go home as planned and \\nwas found by police in an alleyway a short distance from the Station, which supports that he was \\ndisoriented. \\nCredibility and Reliability \\n[83] \\nIn my view, Mr. Nelson’s inability to recall substantial portions of the night of August 2, \\n2018, raises questions about the reliability of his evidence. His memory about the incident is poor. \\nAt the same time, he has admitted the facts that he does not remember, including stabbing Mr. \\nShortliffe, disposing of the knife, and making the 911 call. \\n[84] \\nThe defence submits that it would have been more beneficial to Mr. Nelson’s claim of \\nself-defence to testify to key aspects of the fight and when he stabbed Mr. Shortliffe. He could \\nhave testified as to why he stabbed Mr. Shortliffe. He could have explained how he managed to \\nretrieve and open his knife. Because of the gaps in his memory, he was unable to do so. The defence \\nsubmits that Mr. Nelson’s lack of memory is genuine and that this enhances his credibility; he does \\nnot have a memory of convenience. \\n[85] \\nConversely, the gaps in Mr. Nelson’s memory could be seen as detracting from his \\ncredibility. He has avoided specifically testifying to stabbing Mr. Shortliffe. He could not be \\neffectively cross-examined on what he was thinking at the time or his subsequent actions. He has \\nadmitted facts that would otherwise be incontrovertible, given the video, the DNA on the knife \\nand the 911 recording.  \\n[86] \\nIt is possible that Mr. Nelson has no recollection of what happened between the beating \\nand the police locating him. He had just been attacked and hit in the head multiple times. However, \\nhis lack of memory between being hit by Mr. Shortliffe and being arrested makes it more \\nchallenging to assess his credibility. He simply has no account of his own actions that can be \\nassessed against other evidence. Mr. Nelson was candid about the amount he drank that night and \\nabout being upset by the comment that was made to him. His testimony, as limited as it was, was \\nnot significantly undermined on cross-examination. \\n[87] \\nWhile I acknowledge that Mr. Nelson could have but did not testify about the stabbing in \\na manner favourable to his claim of self-defence, in the circumstances of this case, I do not view \\nthis as enhancing his credibility. Nonetheless, I find certain aspects of Mr. Nelson’s testimony, \\nsuch as how he felt, credible. In respect of what transpired, however, given the significant gaps in \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nMr. Nelson’s memory, I accept Mr. Nelson’s evidence only where it is corroborated by the video \\nrecording and other witnesses.  \\nFactual Findings \\n[88] \\nAfter careful consideration of the totality of the evidence, I find as follows. \\n[89] \\nAt some point during the evening of August 2, 2018, Mr. Shortliffe made a comment to \\nMr. Nelson about his “kind” drinking alcohol. Mr. Penfold testified that Mr. Nelson was upset by \\nthis comment and that he identified Mr. Shortliffe, who was sitting on the patio, as the person who \\nmade the comment to him. It is not clear what made Mr. Nelson believe the comment to be \\nIslamophobic because he does not remember the content of the comment. However, I find that Mr. \\nShortliffe made a comment with a racial element, and that it stemmed from Mr. Shortliffe’s \\nperception that Mr. Nelson was Middle Eastern. Mr. Shortliffe admitted that in his police statement \\nand his testimony at the preliminary inquiry that he had an altercation with a young, Middle Eastern \\nman with a beard. As the defence noted, Mr. Nelson is olive-skinned, dark-haired and had a full \\nbeard at the time. Mr. Nelson self-identifies as a member of the Cree First Nation. It is plausible \\nthat Mr. Shortliffe mistook him as being of Middle Eastern origin. As noted above, Mr. Shortliffe \\nadmitted that he experienced a traumatic incident during his childhood, which was perpetrated by \\nan Algerian man. I note this to observe that the comment that Mr. Nelson perceived as \\nIslamophobic was thus not entirely random or without context.  \\n[90] \\nI further find that although he is not of Middle Eastern origin, Mr. Nelson took great \\noffence to the comment. \\n[91] \\nAfter that comment was made, Mr. Nelson said something to Ms. MacDowall when she \\npassed the bar on her way to the washroom, which she then reported to Mr. Shortliffe. My finding \\nis based on Ms. MacDowall’s testimony, which I accept. Although Mr. Nelson testified that he \\ndoes not recall making any comment to Mr. Shortliffe or Ms. MacDowall, he admitted that after \\nthe comment was made, he said something like “if you don’t like the way I look, you can fuck \\noff.” This had to have taken place inside the bar, because Mr. Nelson was never seated on the \\npatio. In addition, Mr. Penfold testified that Mr. Nelson was cut off because of his behaviour as \\nopposed to his alcohol consumption that night. Moreover, unless there was some further \\ninteraction, the subsequent altercation between Mr. Nelson and Mr. Shortliffe simply makes no \\nsense. As a result, I find that Mr. Nelson said something to Ms. MacDowall about leaving or not \\nbeing welcome at his bar. \\n[92] \\nI accept Mr. Nelson’s testimony that he was leaving the bar when Mr. Shortliffe punched \\nhim in the head and took him down to the ground. On the video, Mr. Nelson is seen facing forward \\nas he walks east. Something causes him to look back. Mr. Shortliffe then comes from behind him \\nbefore taking Mr. Nelson down. The fight took place in front of the Pizza Pizza on the south side \\nof Bloor Street West near the intersection of Jane Street. The location of the fight matches Mr. \\nShortliffe’s recollection of an altercation near the Brown’s bicycle shop, which had a bench in \\nfront of it. The Pizza Pizza was just west of the bicycle shop.  \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[93] \\nMr. Nelson’s testimony about how Mr. Shortliffe attacked him is consistent with the \\nvideo, which shows Mr. Shortliffe expertly grabbed Mr. Nelson, spun him and forced him to the \\nground. The two men actually fell together. Mr. Shortliffe then quickly got on top of Mr. Nelson \\nand delivered 14 punches to Mr. Nelson’s head in rapid-fire fashion. At first, in the video, Mr. \\nNelson appeared to be using his bag to try to shield himself from the blows. He struggled \\nunderneath Mr. Shortliffe. On the video, after approximately eight to ten punches, Mr. Nelson can \\nbe seen moving his arm in a pumping motion. I find that this is when he stabbed Mr. Shortliffe. \\nMr. Shortliffe then got up and stomped on something. I infer from the evidence that he stomped \\non Mr. Nelson’s hand, which was holding the knife. He then dragged Mr. Nelson a few feet on the \\nstreet.  \\n[94] \\nMr. Shortliffe then walked away. Mr. Nelson also walked away after retrieving his hat \\nfrom the street. Ms. Forde and Ms. Trollope testified that Mr. Nelson walked normally in that he \\ndid not appear to be injured. Ms. Weese described Mr. Nelson as walking away slowly. In the \\nvideo, Mr. Nelson did not stagger or limp. He did not appear to be in a hurry. Given that Mr. \\nNelson had no recollection of getting up and leaving, he did not testify as to what he was thinking \\nat the time. \\n[95] \\nThe stabbing could not have taken place in front of the Station patio as Mr. Shortliffe \\ntestified. DC Robert Jitta from Forensic Identification Services marked a single trail of blood drops \\nfrom in front of the Pizza Pizza back to the patio of the Station bar. Had Mr. Shortliffe been stabbed \\nin front of the Station patio, there would have been two trails of blood: one from when he chased \\nafter Mr. Nelson to the intersection and another from when he returned to the Station patio.  \\n[96] \\nI reject the Crown’s theory of the case. Mr. Shortliffe did not recall Mr. Nelson saying \\nsomething to him to get his attention as he left the Station. Mr. Nelson was not waiting for Mr. \\nShortliffe with his knife out. If Mr. Nelson had the knife in his hand, Mr. Shortliffe could not have \\novercome Mr. Nelson so easily. In addition, Mr. Nelson would have used the knife much sooner. \\nIt is illogical that Mr. Nelson would have allowed Mr. Shortliffe to punch him in the head at least   \\neight times before resorting to using the knife.  \\n[97] \\nWhile Mr. Nelson had been cut off at the bar, he had 4-5 pints of beer and was not so \\nintoxicated that he would not have been able to get his knife out from his bag and open it while \\nbeing hit by Mr. Shortliffe. The knife, while not a switchblade, could be opened with one hand. \\nMr. Nelson was accustomed to using the knife, which he used multiple times per day. \\nHas the Crown demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Nelson intended to kill \\nMr. Shortliffe? \\n[98] \\nIn order to find Mr. Nelson guilty of attempted murder under s. 239(1) of the Criminal \\nCode, I must find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to kill \\nMr. Shortliffe. The mens rea for attempted murder is a specific intention to kill; recklessness or \\ncarelessness with respect to the consequences of one’s actions is not sufficient for a finding of guilt \\non a charge of attempted murder: R. v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225. \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[99] \\nIn this case, the Crown concedes that the intention to kill would have to be inferred from \\nthe facts because there is no evidence of an exchange of words. The Crown submits that the \\ncircumstances support an inference that Mr. Nelson intended to kill Mr. Shortliffe because he \\nstabbed Mr. Shortliffe four times with precision and force, near the heart and lungs. The Crown \\nsubmits that injury to those vital organs could have resulted in death, and that Mr. Nelson knew \\nthis. \\n[100] \\nAs noted above, however, the evidence does not support the version of the incident \\nadvanced by the Crown.    \\n[101] \\nIn this case, I find that the Crown has failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt \\nthat Mr. Nelson intended to kill Mr. Shortliffe. Mr. Nelson had been punched repeatedly in the \\nhead when he stabbed Mr. Shortliffe. Mr. Nelson was also visibly struggling under Mr. Shortliffe. \\nThe assault was ongoing. Mr. Nelson testified that he wanted to get away. Given the seriousness \\nof Mr. Shortliffe’s injuries, I find that Mr. Nelson stabbed him with considerable force. However, \\nin the circumstances, it would have been difficult for him to stab Mr. Shortliffe with precision, or \\nto aim at a particular organ. Because Mr. Shortliffe was above Mr. Nelson, who had the knife in \\nhis right hand, stabbing upward would necessarily hit Mr. Shortliffe on the left side of his chest \\narea. While Mr. Nelson may have been reckless or careless as to where he was stabbing Mr. \\nShortliffe and the physical consequences, that is not sufficient to demonstrate that he intended to \\nkill Mr. Shortliffe. \\n[102] \\nAccordingly, the Crown has failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt the offence \\nof attempted murder.   \\nHas the Crown demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Nelson committed \\naggravated assault against Mr. Shortliffe? \\nHas the Crown demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Nelson assaulted Mr. \\nShortliffe with a weapon? \\n[103] \\n As noted above, the defence concedes that the evidence establishes the offences of \\naggravated assault and assault with a weapon.  \\nHas the Crown demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Nelson did not act in self-\\ndefence? \\nThe Applicable Principles \\n[104] \\nSection 34 of the Criminal Code sets out the pre-conditions for self-defence: \\n34 (1) A person is not guilty of an offence if \\n(a)   they believe on reasonable grounds that force is being used \\nagainst them or another person or that a threat of force is being made \\nagainst them or another person; \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n(b)   the act that constitutes the offence is committed for the purpose \\nof defending or protecting themselves or the other person from that \\nuse or threat of force; and \\n(c)   the act committed is reasonable in the circumstances. \\n[105] \\nIn R. v. Khill, 2021 SCC 37, 409 C.C.C. (3d) 141, the Supreme Court of Canada \\nconfirmed the three elements of a successful self-defence claim: (1) the “catalyst”: the accused \\nperson must reasonably believe that force is being used against him or another person; (2) the \\n“motive”: the accused person’s subjective purpose for responding to the threat must be to protect \\nhimself or another; and (3) the “response”: the accused’s act must be reasonable in the \\ncircumstances: Khill, at para. 37.  \\n[106] \\nThe Crown takes the position that there is no air of reality to self-defence. The air of \\nreality test is not an onerous one to meet: R.v. Barrett, 2022 ONCA 355, 162 O.R. (3d) 425, at \\npara. 61. A defence has an air of reality if a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit \\nthe defendant based on the defence: R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, 162 C.C.C. (3d) 129, at para. 2. \\nIn other words, is there evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could be \\nleft with a reasonable doubt about whether Mr. Nelson acted in self-defence? In my view, the \\nanswer is yes. Based on the evidence, Mr. Shortliffe was repeatedly punching Mr. Nelson in the \\nhead, while holding him to the ground. The speed and force with which Mr. Shortliffe was hitting \\nMr. Nelson created a risk to his life and safety.  \\n[107] \\nThe Crown bears the burden of disproving self-defence beyond a reasonable doubt. To \\nsatisfy its burden, the Crown is required to disprove only one of the three elements in s. 34(1): \\nKhill, at para. 185. \\nDid Mr. Nelson have reasonable grounds to believe that force was being used or threatened \\nagainst him by Mr. Shortliffe? \\n[108] \\nWhile the Crown suggests that the physical altercation between Mr. Nelson and Mr. \\nShortliffe was consensual, the video recording shows Mr. Shortliffe unexpectedly taking hold of \\nMr. Nelson and swiftly taking him down to the ground. Aside from the brief interaction in the bar, \\nthere was no lead up immediately before the altercation: no exchange of words, verbal argument, \\npushing, or shoving. Mr. Shortliffe pinned Mr. Nelson down and then began to hit him with rapid, \\nrepeated punches. Mr. Shortliffe delivered 14 blows to Mr. Nelson’s head within 10 seconds. Mr. \\nNelson is seen moving and struggling but does not appear to be able to get out from under Mr. \\nShortliffe.  \\n[109] \\nMr. Nelson testified that when they fell to the ground, he felt a sharp pain in his elbow. \\nHe then experienced excruciating pain in his head and feared for his life. Two eyewitnesses, Ms. \\nForde and Ms. Trollope, were concerned for Mr. Nelson’s safety. They both testified that he was \\nbeing beaten by the other individual. Ms. Forde testified that she turned to tell her husband to call \\n911 but when she turned back, the fight was over. They both testified that they were surprised to \\nsee Mr. Nelson stand up and walk away. \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[110] \\nIn my view, Mr. Nelson had reasonable grounds to believe that force was being used \\nagainst him by Mr. Shortliffe. As a result, the Crown has not demonstrated this element beyond a \\nreasonable doubt. \\nDid Mr. Nelson stab Mr. Shortliffe for the purpose of protecting himself from the use or threat \\nof force by Mr. Shortliffe? \\n[111] \\nAs noted above, this element is subjective. Mr. Nelson does not remember taking out the \\nknife and stabbing Mr. Shortliffe. As a result, he could not testify that he stabbed Mr. Shortliffe to \\nprotect himself. However, this does not mean that the Crown, who bears the burden, has disproven \\nthis element. \\n[112] \\nFrom Mr. Nelson’s perspective, he was leaving the Station when he was suddenly \\npunched in the side of his head and then within seconds taken to the ground in expert fashion. It \\nwas a surprise attack with no lead up. What followed can only be described as a brutal beating. \\nThe video evidence is shocking in the relentlessness of the blows Mr. Shortliffe delivered to Mr. \\nNelson’s head. The video shows Mr. Nelson holding and manipulating his bag, at first likely in \\nattempt to shield his head and then to retrieve the knife. Mr. Nelson stabbed Mr. Shortliffe while \\nhe was pinned to the ground and after Mr. Shortliffe punched him in the head approximately eight \\nto ten times. Even then, despite being stabbed, Mr. Shortliffe continued to hit Mr. Nelson a further \\nfour to six times. \\n[113] \\nThe Crown’s theory, that Mr. Nelson was so upset at Mr. Shortliffe for the comment he \\nmade earlier that he attacked him out of anger, is not supported by the evidence. The Crown has \\nthus failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Nelson did not stab Mr. Shortliffe for the \\npurpose of protecting himself from the use or threat of force by Mr. Shortliffe. \\nWas Mr. Nelson’s use of force reasonable in the circumstances? \\n[114] \\nSection 34(2) of the Criminal Code sets out a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider in \\nassessing the reasonableness of the accused’s act: \\n \\nthe nature of the force or threat;  \\n \\nthe extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other \\nmeans available to respond to the potential use of force;  \\n \\nthe accused’s role in the incident;  \\n \\nwhether any of the people involved used or threatened to use a weapon;  \\n \\nthe size, age, gender and physical capabilities of those involved in the incident;  \\n \\nthe nature, duration and history of any relationship among the people involved in \\nthe incident, including any prior use or threat of force, and the nature of that force \\nor threat;  \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n(f.1) \\nany history of interaction or communication among the people involved in the \\nincident;  \\n \\nthe nature and proportionality of the accused’s response to the use or threat of force; \\nand  \\n \\nwhether the accused’s act was in response to a use or threat of force that he knew \\nwas lawful. \\n[115] \\nEach factor informs “the overall reasonableness of the accused’s actions in the \\ncircumstances”: Khill, at para. 42.  No one factor is dispositive; rather, the consideration of the \\nfactors is a “global, holistic exercise”: Khill, at para. 69.   \\n[116] \\nBased on my consideration of the relevant factors, as detailed below, I find that Mr. \\nNelson’s response in the circumstances was not unreasonable.  \\nThe nature of the force or threat \\n[117] \\nI have found that Mr. Nelson was being brutally beaten by Mr. Shortliffe. Mr. Shortliffe \\npunched Mr. Nelson in the head multiple times in a relentless and rapid manner. The head is a \\nvulnerable part of the body, injury to which could lead to serious consequences. The nature of the \\nforce or threat was unexpected and significant. \\nThe extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available \\nto respond to the potential use of force \\n[118] \\nI am mindful that in assessing this factor, it is necessary to consider the speed with which \\nthe situation unfolded, and that Mr. Nelson had little time to consider his options. People in \\nstressful and dangerous situations do not have time for subtle reflection: R. v. Cunha, 2016 ONCA \\n491, 337 C.C.C. (3d) 7, at para. 7.  \\n[119] \\nThe Crown submits that Mr. Nelson, who was approximately the same height but 50 \\npounds heavier than Mr. Shortliffe, could have thrown him off to get away. On the video, Mr. \\nNelson is seen struggling but does not appear able to get Mr. Shortliffe off him. The eyewitnesses \\ndescribed Mr. Shortliffe muscular and having the upper hand. It is relevant that from Mr. Nelson’s \\nperspective, the attack was unexpected, speedy and continuous. I accept Mr. Nelson’s testimony \\nthat he felt disoriented but that he wanted to get away. That would be an expected reaction to such \\nan attack. \\n[120] \\nThe use of force was imminent. De-escalation was not an option. Mr. Nelson was \\nshielding his head but unable to strike back. Mr. Shortliffe was overpowering him. In my view, \\nthe reasonably available options to Mr. Nelson were limited. While I have significant concerns \\nabout Mr. Nelson introducing a knife into a physical fight, he did not do so immediately. He \\nsustained at least eight blows before using the knife.  \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nThe person’s role in the incident \\n[121] \\nThe phrase “person’s role in the incident” is to be interpreted broadly, consistent with \\nParliament’s intent: Khill, at para. 74. “‘[T]he person’s role in the incident’ refers to the person’s \\nconduct — such as actions, omissions and exercises of judgment — during the course of the \\nincident, from beginning to end, that is relevant to whether the ultimate act was reasonable in the \\ncircumstances”: Khill, at para.74. The “phrase ‘role in the incident’ encompasses not only \\nprovocative or unlawful conduct but also hotheadedness, the reckless escalation of risk, and a \\nfailure to reasonably reassess the situation as it unfolds”: Khill, at para. 84.  \\n[122] \\nThe Crown takes the position that Mr. Nelson used excessive force because he “brought \\na knife to a fist fight.” The Crown submits that Mr. Nelson could have fought back without resort \\nto stabbing Mr. Shortliffe.  \\n[123] \\nMr. Nelson had the knife with him while out at his regular bar. Mr. Nelson testified that \\nhe always had his knife with him because he uses it at work to open boxes of surgical equipment. \\nOn August 2, 2018, Mr. Nelson went home after work before going to the Station. Mr. Nelson \\nbrought his bag with him to the Station. He explained that he kept the knife in his bag so that he \\nwould always have it at work.  \\n[124] \\nI have found that Mr. Shortliffe made a comment that Mr. Nelson perceived as racist and \\nthat this upset him significantly. I have also found that Mr. Nelson must have said something to \\nMs. MacDowall about not being welcome at his bar. While neither man recalls making a comment \\nto the other, the fight that ensued is otherwise inexplicable. As it is, both men’s reactions to the \\ncomment that the other made was disproportionate and unreasonable. This was undoubtedly \\nimpacted by the amount of alcohol they had both consumed.  \\n[125] \\nDespite being upset by the comment made by Mr. Shortliffe, however, Mr. Nelson \\naccepted that he would not be served more alcohol and paid his bill. He was leaving the bar when \\nhe was unexpectedly taken to the ground by Mr. Shortliffe. There was no opportunity to de-\\nescalate. Mr. Shortliffe did not say anything to Mr. Nelson to which he could have responded \\nverbally. \\n[126] \\nWhere a defendant had not prior interaction with the victim and was subjected to an \\nunprovoked assault, the absence of the defendant’s role in the confrontation may militate strongly \\nin favour of the defendant: Khill, at para. 101 (citations omitted). \\n[127] \\nI have rejected the Crown’s theory that Mr. Nelson was waiting for Mr. Shortliffe with \\nhis knife ready and that he said something to get Mr. Shortliffe’s attention. I further reject that the \\nphysical fight that followed was consensual. While he was belligerent earlier in the evening, when \\nhe was leaving the bar, Mr. Nelson was not looking for a fight. The video recording shows a very \\nunequal fight. In terms of Mr. Nelson’s role in the incident, I find that he did not initiate the \\nphysical altercation. He did, however, escalate the risk when he took his knife out and used it. \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nWhether any of the people involved used or threatened to use a weapon \\n[128] \\nMr. Shortliffe was not armed. Mr. Nelson was armed with a knife and used it to stab Mr. \\nShortliffe. \\nThe size, age, gender and physical capabilities of those involved in the incident \\n[129] \\nBoth men are approximately six feet tall. Mr. Nelson weighed 210 pounds at the time, \\nwhich is 50 pounds more than Mr. Shortliffe, who weighed 160 pounds.  \\n[130] \\nWhile the two men are only one year apart in age, all of the eyewitnesses perceived Mr. \\nNelson as approximately 10 years older than Mr. Shortliffe. All of the eyewitnesses described the \\ncontrast between the physical appearance of the two men in similar terms: Mr. Nelson was heavier \\nor “chubbier”, while Mr. Shortliffe was slim and “muscular.”  \\n[131] \\nThe manner in which Mr. Shortliffe was able to take Mr. Nelson to the ground before Mr. \\nNelson, despite his size, could resist suggests that Mr. Shortliffe has greater physical capabilities, \\nat least in terms of physical fighting. Mr. Shortliffe spun and brought Mr. Nelson down with ease, \\nor as defence counsel characterized it in a “UFC move.” However, Mr. Shortliffe was not cross-\\nexamined about any martial arts or other training and there is no evidence that he has such training.  \\nThe nature, duration and history of any relationship among the people involved in the incident \\n[132] \\nOther than the brief interaction at the Station, there is no evidence of any history of a \\nrelationship between Mr. Nelson and Mr. Shortliffe. The absence of a relationship could increase \\nthe perceived risk of a threat to a reasonable person, especially considering the unanticipated nature \\nof the physical violence.  \\nAny history of interaction or communication among the people involved in the incident \\n[133] \\nBased on Mr. Nelson’s testimony, he and Mr. Shortliffe had a brief interaction which \\nincluded a reference to whether individuals of Mr. Nelson’s “kind” could drink. Mr. Nelson \\nunderstood the comment to be Islamophobic and found it offensive. Mr. Nelson then said \\nsomething to Ms. MacDowall and tried to prevent her from going to the bathroom, which she \\nreported to Mr. Shortliffe. \\nThe nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force  \\n[134] \\nI have described both the physical fight and stabbing earlier in these reasons. As noted \\nabove, the Crown submits that Mr. Nelson’s use of force was excessive because he introduced a \\nknife to a consensual, physical altercation.  \\n[135] \\nAs stated above, the physical attack on Mr. Nelson was not a consensual fight. \\nNonetheless, Mr. Nelson escalated the level of risk of grievous injury when he took out his knife. \\nMr. Nelson stabbed Mr. Shortliffe with force four times. Mr. Shortliffe continued to punch Mr. \\nNelson while he was being stabbed. He did not recall how many times he hit Mr. Nelson. When it \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nwas put to him that he stopped hitting Mr. Nelson because he had been stabbed, he testified that \\nhe stopped because it was “enough.” Mr. Shortliffe also testified to feeling “fine” when he returned \\nto the Station patio. On a strict proportionality analysis, I would be inclined to find that Mr. \\nNelson’s response was disproportionate to the use of force by Mr. Shortliffe. However, because \\nMr. Shortliffe continued to hit Mr. Nelson and seemed unaware of his injuries, I cannot find that \\nMr. Nelson’s use of force was excessive. In the circumstances, it is not possible to find, for \\nexample, that Mr. Shortliffe would have stopped hitting Mr. Nelson if Mr. Nelson had simply \\nthreatened him with the knife or stabbed him once. \\nWhether the person’s act was in response to a use or threat of force that he knew was lawful \\n[136] \\nIn the circumstances, this factor does not apply. \\nOverall Assessment of Reasonableness \\n[137] \\nThe third element of self-defence is an overall consideration of the reasonableness of Mr. \\nNelson’s act in the circumstances.  The Supreme Court held in Khill, at para. 2, that “self-defence \\ndemands a broader societal perspective. Consequently, one of the important conditions limiting \\nthe availability of self-defence is that the act committed must be reasonable in the circumstances.” \\nAs further articulated by the Court in Khill, at para. 62, “the reasonableness inquiry under s. \\n34(1)(c) operates to ensure that the law of self-defence conforms to community norms of conduct.” \\n[138] \\n Section 34(2) states that in assessing reasonableness “the court shall consider the relevant \\ncircumstances of the person, the other parties and the act”. The “circumstances” are not simply \\nthose that existed between Mr. Nelson and Mr. Shortliffe but include the non-exhaustive list of \\nfactors in s. 34(2) and other relevant factors such as the location of the incident, the time of the \\nincident, and the other parties who were present: R. v. Owusu, 2022 ONCJ 667, at para. 72. \\n[139] \\nI have difficulty finding that Mr. Nelson’s conduct, of stabbing Mr. Shortliffe with force \\nresulting in life-threatening injuries during a physical fight, accords with community norms of \\nconduct. At the same time, the community would not expect Mr. Nelson not to respond to an \\nunprovoked attack or to continue to subject himself to a relentless physical beating. Moreover, Mr. \\nNelson had little opportunity to consider his options. He had to try to get away. Based on the \\nfactors considered above, and the totality of the circumstances, in my view, the Crown has failed \\nto demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Nelson’s conduct was unreasonable in the \\ncircumstances.  \\n[140] \\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \\nself-defence does not apply.  \\nConclusion \\n[141] \\nFor all the foregoing reasons, I find the defendant, Paul Nelson, not guilty of attempted \\nmurder, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.  \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\nNishikawa J.  \\nReleased: March 27, 2024 \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1815 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nCITATION: R. v.

Mr. Mulimbwa was walking towards them and \\nappeared to Cst McEachran to be in some sort of distress: shuffling slowly and having trouble \\nmaintaining his balance. Cst McEachran asked the appellant if he was okay, but he received no \\nresponse.1 As the Appellant walked past, he dropped his water bottle several times; he had \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023, p. 54. \\n2024 ONSC 1820 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\ntrouble picking it up, losing his balance as he attempted to do so. Cst McEachran thought he \\n“mirrored somebody who might be under the influence”.2 \\n[4] \\nCst. McEachran continued to observe Mr. Mulimbwa and followed him at a distance.  He \\nbecame further concerned when he saw Mr. Mulimbwa enter a car parked on the side of the road.  \\nAt that point, Cst. McEachran called 911 and requested police attend.3 \\n[5] \\nCst. Jonathan Plue arrived on scene.  He knocked on the driver’s side window of the car.  \\nMr. Mulimbwa appeared to be sleeping.  Mr. Mulimbwa did not respond so Cst. Plue opened the \\ndriver’s door.  There was a strong smell of cannabis.  Cst. Plue shook Mr. Mulimbwa’s shoulder, \\nand he woke up.  He was arrested for public intoxication at that time.4 \\n[6] \\nCst. Plue observed that Mr. Mulimbwa had poor balance while walking to his cruiser.  \\nMr. Mulimbwa was searched incident to arrest and the key to the car was found in his pocket.  \\nGiven the smell of cannabis and Mr. Mulimbwa’s “incredibly disoriented, confused state as well \\nas his poor balance” the officer read a standard field sobriety test and based on Mr. Mulimbwa’s \\nperformance of that test, he was arrested for care and control of a conveyance while impaired. 5  \\n[7] \\nA search of the car turned up cannabis and drug paraphernalia.  Mr. Mulimbwa was read \\nthe standard right to counsel, cautions and a drug recognition evaluation demand.6  He was \\ntransported to the station.  Ultimately, a urine sample was obtained. \\n[8] \\nThe results of the urine sample revealed that Mr. Mulimbwa had the metabolite for \\ncannabis and traces of cocaine in his system.7 \\n                                                 \\n \\n2 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023, p. 54-55. \\n3 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023, p. 59. \\n4 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023, pp. 11-12.  \\n5 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at pp. 14-16. \\n6 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023, p. 78. \\n7 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023 at pp. 32-33. \\n2024 ONSC 1820 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n[9] \\nAs noted earlier, Mr. Mulimbwa was self-represented at trial.  Before the trial started, the \\ntrial judge ascertained Mr. Mulimbwa’s age, education level and occupation and then explained \\nthe trial process to Mr. Mulimbwa.  He also ensured that Mr. Mulimbwa had a hard copy of the \\ndisclosure.  As the trial proceeded, the trial judge explained specific aspects of the trial process \\nsuch as cross-examination, the elements of the offence, the law relating to care and control8, the \\nrole of an expert witness9, the rule in Browne v. Dunn10, the presumption of innocence, and the \\naccused’s right to remain silent. 11 \\n[10] \\nIt became clear from Mr. Mulimbwa’s questions and interjections, primarily during the \\ntoxicologist’s evidence, that he was adamant he had not ingested any cocaine.  On the other \\nhand, he did not deny ingesting cannabis.12 \\n[11] \\nThe toxicologist outlined the effect that both cannabis and cocaine could have on a \\nperson who had ingested these substances as well as the effect on their driving ability.13  The trial \\njudge asked questions about whether and how a person could accidentally ingest a drug.  The \\ntoxicologist explained that passive inhalation in certain circumstances could result in accidental \\ningestion of a drug.14 \\n[12] \\nAt the end of the first day of trial, there were the following exchanges between the trial \\njudge and Mr. Mulimbwa: \\nCourt: So, Mr. Mulimbwa just a couple of questions, you don’t have to tell me what your \\ndefence is although I’m able to frankly gather part of it, right?  Like, I’ve heard you tell \\nus quite clearly that you had no intention to drive and that would be, that’s evidence \\nwhich would relate directly to guilt or innocence on this charge.  Part of the charge \\nrelates to whether or not your ability to drive a motor vehicle was in fact impaired at the \\n                                                 \\n \\n8 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023, p. 68, Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at pp. 4-5. \\n9 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023, p. 24-26. \\n10 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023 at p. 8. \\n11 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023 at p. 6-10, 12. \\n12 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023 at p. 35-36, 43. \\n13 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023 at pp. 35-38. \\n14 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023 at pp. 44-45. \\n2024 ONSC 1820 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\ntime, is that part of the case you’re contesting as well?  Is your defence simply, like, I just \\nwasn’t going to drive anywhere? \\nMr. Mulimbwa: I wasn’t going to drive anywhere, but I was impaired. \\nCourt: You was, you were or were not impaired? \\nMr. Mulimbwa: I was impaired. \\nCourt: You were impaired. Okay…15 \\n(…) \\nCourt: Sounds to me like you’re admitting that you were impaired in which case we can \\njust kind of focus on the main issue. \\nMr. Mulimbwa: Yeah, so….16 \\n(…) \\nCourt: So, you’re prepared to make the admission that you were in fact impaired. I think \\nthat admission is limited to cannabis so you’re not, the cocaine you seem to be disputing \\nthat part of it, but you’re not disputing that you were impaired by drug on the occasion.  \\nCorrect? \\nMr. Mulimbwa: Occasionally? \\nCourt: On, oh no, the day that we’re talking about. \\nMr. Mulimbwa: No. \\nCourt: Right, that morning you would agree that you were impaired by drugs that day? \\nMr. Mulimbwa: Yeah, I was impaired.17 \\n[13] \\nMr. Mulimbwa testified in his own defence.  Unfortunately, he was unable to recall much \\nof what happened that morning.18  He was adamant he had no intention of driving.19 He believed \\n                                                 \\n \\n15 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023, p. 79-80. \\n16 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023, p. 82. \\n17 Trial transcript, March 1, 2023, p. 84. \\n18 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at pp. 45-46. \\n19 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at p. 38. \\n2024 ONSC 1820 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nthe events had occurred at night and that he had come directly from his house to his car to \\nretrieve his cellphone charger so he would be able to set his alarm for the next morning.  He \\nstated that as soon as he got into his car, he fell asleep.  The car was parked across the street from \\nhis home.20 \\n[14] \\nIn cross-examination, he stated that he had parked across the street from his home \\nbecause the driveway was full. He also stated that it was his usual practice to move his car into \\nthe driveway as soon as a spot became available.21 \\n[15] \\nMr. Mulimbwa denied walking on the street where he was observed by Cst. McEachran \\nand stated he could not recall any interaction with the constable. He had no recollection of doing \\nanything other than coming from his house directly to the car.22 \\n[16] \\nMr. Mulimbwa did not dispute the fact he had consumed cannabis on that day.23  \\nHowever, he was adamant he had not consumed cocaine.24 \\nReasons for decision \\n[17] \\nThe trial judge found that Mr. Mulimbwa had conceded that he was impaired by \\ncannabis, but that his testimony was that he had not had any intention to drive when he got into \\nhis car.25 \\n[18] \\nThe trial judge also found that a search of Mr. Mulimbwa revealed that he had the key \\nfob to the car in his pocket.26 \\n                                                 \\n \\n20 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at pp. 31-32, 51. \\n21 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at p. 34. \\n22 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at p. 36 \\n23 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at p. 40 \\n24 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at pp. 41-43. \\n25 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at p. 58. \\n26 Trial transcript, March 2, 2023 at p. 60. \\n2024 ONSC 1820 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n[19] \\nHe identified that the first issue to be determined was whether the presumption in relation \\nto care and control had been rebutted by the evidence.  The trial judge reviewed Mr. Mulimbwa’s \\ntestimony, particularly as it contrasted with the evidence of the police officers.  The trial judge \\nnoted that Mr. Mulimbwa was an honest witness. \\n[20] \\nHowever, he indicated he accepted the evidence of the officers.  He noted the areas where \\nMr. Mulimbwa’s evidence diverged from that of the police officers, specifically, that the events \\noccurred in the morning and not at night as alleged by Mr. Mulimbwa and the fact Mr. \\nMulimbwa had no recollection of walking down the street, dropping a water bottle several times \\nor interacting with another driver attempting to back out onto the street.27 \\n[21] \\nThe trial judge then noted, \\nAnd so, it is against the backdrop of these reliability concerns with respect to your \\nevidence that I have to measure your memory that you were just going to get your \\ncharger for your phone, and you didn’t plan to drive anywhere.28 \\n[22] \\nHe goes on to conclude, \\n[The inconsistency relating to time of day], along with the fact that you were \\nwalking along a path that was inconsistent with your stated intention in court of \\njust getting a phone from across the street, does not permit me to accept your \\nevidence that that in fact was your purpose, that you were going to get your \\ncharger and you weren’t planning on driving.29 \\n(…) \\nAnd so, I look at your evidence in its totality and unfortunately, it leaves me with \\nevidence that is completely unreliable despite the fact that you were doing your \\nbest to give reliable evidence.

The duty of trial \\njudges to assist a self-represented accused will vary depending on the specific circumstances.  As \\nnoted in R. v. Chemama, \\nHow far the trial judge should go in assisting the accused is a matter of discretion, \\nvarying with each trial and depending upon the sophistication of the accused, the \\nseriousness of the offence, the nature of the defence, and many other factors \\nindividual to each case.35 \\n[31] \\nImportantly, the goal of the trial judge in these circumstances is to ensure a fair trial.  \\nNothing more.  As stated in R. v. Harrer, \\nAt base, a fair trial is a trial that appears fair, both from the perspective of the \\naccused and the perspective of the community.  A fair trial must not be confused \\nwith the most advantageous trial possible from the accused’s point of view.  Nor \\nmust it be conflated with the perfect trial; in the real world, perfection is seldom \\nattained.  A fair trial is one which satisfies the public interest in getting at the \\ntruth, while preserving basic procedural fairness to the accused.36 \\n[32] \\nIn R. v. Richards, the Ontario Court of Appeal outlined details of the duty owed by a trial \\njudge to a self-represented accused.  It indicated, \\nWhere an accused is self-represented, a trial judge has a duty to ensure that the \\naccused has a fair trial. To fulfill this duty, the trial judge must provide guidance \\nto the accused to the extent the circumstances of the case and accused may \\nrequire. Within reason, the trial judge must provide assistance to aid the accused \\nin the proper conduct of his defence and to guide him as the trial unfolds in such a \\nway that the defence is brought out with its full force and effect….  \\nThe duty owed by trial judges to self-represented litigants is circumscribed by a \\nstandard of reasonableness. The trial judge is not, and must not become, counsel \\n                                                 \\n \\n35 2016 ONCA 579 at para. 13. \\n36 [1995] 3 SCR 562 at para. 45 [case citations omitted]. \\n2024 ONSC 1820 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nfor the accused. The judge is not entitled, indeed prohibited, from providing the \\nassistance of the kind counsel would furnish when retained to do so…. A standard \\nof reasonableness accommodates a range of options to ensure the necessary \\ndegree of assistance and eschews a single exclusive response. The onus on the \\ntrial judge to assist the self-represented accused is a heavy one. This \\ncharacterization means that it is not enough that the verdict at the end of the trial \\nis or appears correct. What matters is whether the trial has been fair to the self-\\nrepresented accused…  \\nThe onus extends, at least can extend, to an obligation on the trial judge to raise \\nCharter issues on the judge's own motion where the accused is self-\\nrepresented…. This is not to say, however, that this specific obligation becomes \\nengaged on the mere scent or intimation of a possible Charter infringement…. \\nBut where there is admissible uncontradicted evidence of a relevant Charter \\nbreach, the trial judge has an obligation to raise the issue, invite submissions and \\nenter upon an inquiry into the infringement and its consequences….37 \\n[33] \\nUltimately, the test on appellate review is whether on a review of the complete trial \\nrecord, the trial judge’s conduct of the trial was reasonable and fair to all parties. \\n[34] \\nIn the present case, the parties agree that the evidence at trial indicated that the Appellant \\nwas impaired.  They also agree that the Appellant’s ingestion of cannabis was voluntary and that \\nof cocaine, involuntary. \\n[35] \\nWhere the parties differ is; \\n\\uf0b7 Was the admission by the Appellant that he was impaired by cannabis valid; \\n\\uf0b7 Should the trial judge have considered a mens rea defence based on the accidental \\ningestion of cocaine; \\n\\uf0b7 Should the trial judge have considered the impact that the accidental ingestion of cocaine \\nhad on the issue of care and control? \\n[36] \\nThere was no evidence at trial that the Appellant accidentally ingested cocaine.  \\nHowever, the evidence that the Appellant had cocaine in his system was incontrovertible and to \\n                                                 \\n \\n37 R. v. Richards, 2017 ONCA 424 at paras. 110-113 [case citations omitted]. \\n2024 ONSC 1820 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nthe extent that cocaine was considered in the trial, it was on the basis that the Appellant \\naccidentally ingested it. \\n[37] \\nOn appeal, both parties also assumed that the cocaine was accidentally ingested. \\n[38] \\nAs noted earlier in this decision, the evidence that the Appellant was impaired by a drug \\nwas overwhelming.  In my view, the admission elicited by the Appellant that he was impaired by \\ncannabis was entirely consistent with all the evidence and served to focus the trial on the live \\nissue – care and control.  While it might have been better had the trial judge not elicited the \\nadmission of impairment, the admission did not and could not have changed the focus of the \\ntrial. \\n[39] \\nDefence, in his oral argument, tried to compartmentalize the effects of cannabis and those \\nof cocaine and suggested that the impairment observed by the witnesses was solely due to \\ncocaine and not cannabis.  Additionally, Defence argued that if the impairment was due \\nexclusively to cocaine and the cocaine was accidentally ingested then, based on caselaw \\ninvolving accidental intoxication, the Appellant could have raised the defence that he did not \\nhave the necessary mens rea for the offence.38 \\n[40] \\nI cannot accept that proposition.  There was no evidence at trial that the impairment \\nobserved was solely due to cocaine and no evidence on this appeal that it is possible to isolate the \\neffects of cocaine from those of cannabis.  The only evidence at trial was that cocaine would \\nhave exacerbated the effect of the cannabis.   \\n                                                 \\n \\n38 R. v. McGrath, 2013 ONCJ 528. \\n2024 ONSC 1820 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n[41] \\nAdditionally, the Crown’s obligation with respect to mens rea is to prove that the accused \\nvoluntarily consumed a drug knowing it could impair his ability to drive.39 It does not extend \\nfurther.  As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Brown, \\nThe cases say that intoxication is “self-induced” where the accused voluntarily \\ningests a substance that they know or ought to know is an intoxicant, in \\ncircumstances where the risk of becoming intoxicated is or should be within their \\ncontemplation.40 \\n[42] \\nIn R. v. Scerbo, the accused testified that he had voluntarily ingested cannabis but not \\nalprazolam.  Both these substances were found in his urine.  The trial judge in that case accepted \\nthat the accused had involuntarily consumed alprazolam.  However, the trial judge found that this \\nfact did not deprive the accused of mens rea.41 \\n[43] \\nIn the present case, the evidence from the Appellant was that he had voluntarily ingested \\ncannabis.  Consequently, there was no reason for the trial judge to consider the mens rea issue.  \\n[44] \\nThe remaining issue is whether the trial judge should have considered the impact that the \\naccidental ingestion of the cocaine had on the issue of care and control.  The evidence of the \\ntoxicologist was that the combination of the two drugs would exacerbate impairment. \\n[45] \\nDefence asserted that cocaine in the ‘crash phase’ would have brought on sudden, \\nextreme fatigue making it much less likely that Mr. Mulimbwa would have driven the car. The \\ntrial judge did not consider this possibility in his assessment of the care and control issue. \\n                                                 \\n \\n39 R v King, [1962] SCR 746; R v MacCannell (1980), 54 CCC (2d) 188 (OCA); R v Murray (1985), 22 CCC (3d) \\n502 (OCA); R v McGrath, 2013 ONCJ 528 at para 8; R v Imrie, 2017 ONCJ 383 at para 342. \\n40 R v Brown, 2022 SCC 18 at para 82. \\n41 R v Scerbo, 2018 ONCJ 422 at paras 7-10. \\n2024 ONSC 1820 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\n[46] \\nThe Crown responded that the prosecution is not required to prove what drug caused the \\nimpairment,42 nor is it necessary that the drug be the sole cause of the impairment.  The drug \\nonly needs to be a contributing factor.43   \\n[47] \\nThe trial judge, correctly in my view, considered the whole of the evidence of impairment \\nin determining the care and control issue.  The fact that he did not allude specifically to the \\npresence of cocaine as a contributing factor – even a major contributing factor – does not alter \\nthe fact Mr. Mulimbwa was impaired by a drug and was in care and control of a conveyance.  \\nConclusion \\n[48] \\nIn the present case, the trial judge conducted himself properly and provided ample \\nexplanations, instructions, and assistance to Mr. Mulimbwa within the confines of his judicial \\nrole.  The mens rea defence asserted by counsel on appeal has no air of reality, the admission \\nelicited from the Appellant did not negatively impact the fairness of the trial and the trial judge \\nproperly considered the whole of the evidence in concluding that the Crown had proven the case \\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. \\n \\n \\n[49] \\nThe appeal is dismissed. \\n \\n \\nReleased: March 27, 2024 \\nParfett J. \\n                                                 \\n \\n42 R. v.

A notice was sent out by the \\nRegistrar informing all owners of the relevant firearms that their firearms were now prohibited. \\n[5] \\nA series of applications for review were brought by gun owners across the province of \\nOntario, including the one that is the subject of this appeal. \\n[6] \\nThe Attorney-General of Canada (AGC) disputed the jurisdiction of the OCJ to hear \\nthese applications. \\nProcedural History \\n[7] \\nIn the present case, an application for summary dismissal due to lack of jurisdiction was \\nheard on May 9, 2021, in the OCJ.  At that time, the judge declined to dismiss the application \\nnoting that, \\nThe onus is on the applicants to establish both that this Court has jurisdiction and \\nthat, if the Registrar did make a decision to revoke their certificates, which this \\nCourt can review under s. 74 that that decision was not justified.2 \\n[8] \\nPre-trial motions were heard by the Ontario Court of Justice on July 26, 2022.  The \\nAppellant was seeking disclosure and the AGC was again disputing the OCJ’s jurisdiction to \\nhear the application. \\n[9] \\nThe hearing judge identified the issues before her as follows: \\n                                                 \\n \\n2 J.P. v. AGC, unreported decision re Ottawa file 20-30250 released May 9, 2021 at para. 20 (OCJ). \\n2024 ONSC 1822 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n1. Did the Registrar revoke the firearm registration issued to the Applicant, thereby \\ntriggering the right of the Applicant to apply for a reference pursuant to s. 74 of the \\nFirearms Act? \\n2. If the answer is yes, did the Registrar properly exercise its discretion? In this case, no \\nindividualized assessment was done, therefore, this would require an analysis of the \\neffect of the amendments re-classifying firearms from the status of ‘restricted’ to \\n‘prohibited’ firearm.3 \\n[10] \\nHaving defined the issues in the above manner, the hearing judge did not grant the \\nAppellant’s disclosure request, excluded two of his affidavits and excised portions of his own \\naffidavit. \\n[11] \\nIn December 2022, the Appellant asked the court to adjourn the hearing dates pending the \\nrelease of the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in AGC v. M.C.4 as it was anticipated that the \\ncourt would deal with the issue of jurisdiction.  That request was granted.5 \\n[12] \\nOn June 30, 2023, the AGC brought a further motion for summary dismissal.  The \\nOntario Court of Appeal decision in AGC v. M.C had just been released dealing with the \\njurisdictional issue.6  The Appellant argued that his situation was factually distinguishable from \\nthe situation in the M.C. case and therefore, it did not apply. \\n[13] \\nThe hearing judge dismissed the Appellant’s application stating the following: \\nI think the Court of Appeal is …. indicating to the trial judge faced with the issue of \\njurisdiction that we do not have jurisdiction…. The Court of Appeal does not reiterate or \\nconfirm Justice Doody’s decision that this issue is one of [mixed] fact and law.  At para. \\n22, the Court is clear: \\nThe Respondents’ registration certificates became invalid by operation of law.  It \\nwas not as a result of any function performed by the Registrar. \\n                                                 \\n \\n3 J.P. v.

And further \\nquotes, “it was a statutory change that impacted an entire class of individuals, owners of \\ncertain types of firearms”.  I continue quoting: \\nSuch a decision is not caught by Section 74 of the Firearms Act.  Consequently, \\nin these circumstances there is nothing to confirm, cancel, review or consider \\nunder s. 74 of the Firearms Act….  In other words, there is no jurisdiction. \\n(…) \\nA change in the law nullified the respondents’ registration certificates.  The \\nRegistrar was merely the messenger.  The reference judge had no jurisdiction to \\nconduct a hearing under s. 74 of the Firearms Act, nor to make any other orders, \\nincluding the disclosure order. \\nSo in my view, I have no jurisdiction and that is the end of the matter.7 \\n[14] \\nThe Appellant now appeals from that decision and requests that the matter be remitted to \\nthe OCJ for a hearing.  The AGC has brought this motion for summary dismissal arguing that the \\nOntario Court of Appeal has ruled on the issue of jurisdiction and consequently, the Appellant’s \\nappeal has no chance of success. \\nAnalysis \\n[15] \\nThe test on an application for summary dismissal in a criminal matter is set out in R. v. \\nHaevischer.8  It states, \\n[A]n application in a criminal proceeding, including for stay of proceedings for \\nabuse of process, should only be summarily dismissed if the application is \\n‘manifestly frivolous’.  This threshold best preserves fair trials, protects the \\naccused’s right to full answer and defence, and ensures efficient court \\nproceedings.9 \\n                                                 \\n \\n7 Transcript of ruling of Dorval, J released June 30, 2023 at pp. 8-10, citing AGC v. M.C. et al, 2023 ONCA 448 at \\nparas. 22 & 24. \\n8 2023 SCC 11. \\n9 At para. 3. \\n2024 ONSC 1822 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n[16] \\nIn the context of a civil proceeding, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that a \\nsummary dismissal is appropriate if “‘it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be \\ntrue, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action’ or, alternatively phrased, if the \\nclaim has no reasonable prospect of success.”10 \\n[17] \\nThe parties in this present hearing do not agree whether this matter is criminal or civil in \\nnature.  The AGC argued that it was a civil matter, relying on the decision in Crukley, et al, v. \\nAttorney-General of Canada (Registrar of Firearms)11.  The Appellant maintained the same \\nposition as the Appellants in the Crukley matter did – that the Firearms Act is enacted as \\ncriminal law and therefore, that this appeal was fundamentally criminal in nature.   \\n[18] \\nIn the Haevischer decision, the Supreme Court notes that the purpose behind summary \\ndismissals and/or summary judgments in civil matters is essentially the same for summary \\ndismissal of criminal matters, that is to say, to promote efficiency and to weed out unmeritorious \\nclaims.12  However, this decision also cautions, that in criminal matters where an accused’s right \\nto full answer and defence is at issue, care must be taken not to prematurely dismiss a claim, \\nparticularly where that claim is novel or close to the line.13 \\n[19] \\nI did not rule on the issue of whether this matter was civil or criminal in nature because it \\nwas not required in this case.  Whether the civil standard relating to summary dismissal or the \\nmore restrictive criminal standard is used, the result would be the same. \\n[20] \\nThe Appellant argued, much as he had in the OCJ, that his case is different from those \\ndealt with in the M.C. case and therefore, that case has no application to his situation. \\n                                                 \\n \\n10 At para. 48. \\n11 Unreported decision re Brockville files 22-0153, 22-0155, 22-0152, 22-0154 released November 21, 2022 (OCJ) \\n12 Haevischer at paras. 48-49. \\n13 At para. 55. \\n2024 ONSC 1822 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\n[21] \\nHe argued more specifically that the letter he received was different from the ones in the \\nM.C. case in that it was written to him, and the firearms listed in that letter were different from \\nthose listed in the letters cited in the M.C. case.   \\n[22] \\nHe stated he was not taking the position that the Registrar’s letter was a revocation.  \\nInstead, he agrees that the letter was informational only.   \\n[23] \\nFinally, he argued that Justice Doody in his decision had indicated that the OCJ did have \\njurisdiction to hear the matter and that, consequently, Justice Dorval should not have summarily \\ndismissed the case without a hearing on the merits.  Furthermore, he stated that it was \\nprocedurally unfair not to hear the matter on a full evidentiary record. \\n[24] \\nI disagree with the Appellant on all points. \\n[25] \\nThe Appellant’s case is virtually identical to the situation in the M.C. case. The letter sent \\nout by the Registrar to owners of affected firearms was a form letter.  The fact that the name on \\nthe letter or the listed firearms differed from owner to owner does not change my conclusion that \\nthe substance of the letter was identical. \\n[26] \\nThe fact the Appellant concedes that his letter was not a revocation and was purely \\ninformational serves to reinforce the extent to which this case and the M.C. case are \\nfundamentally, the same. \\n[27] \\nAs noted earlier in this decision, Justice Doody did not rule that the OCJ had jurisdiction \\nto hear the s. 74 Firearms Act application.  Instead, he ruled that jurisdiction was a live issue in \\nthe case and would have to be decided before the applicants could proceed to the substance of \\nthe application. \\n[28] \\nFinally, there is no procedural unfairness engaged in this matter by not having a more \\nsubstantial evidentiary record.  No amount of further evidence is going to change the reality of \\nthe situation.  As noted in the M.C. decision, the letter sent to firearms owners was not a \\nrevocation and consequently, the OCJ does not have jurisdiction to hear the matter. \\n2024 ONSC 1822 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\n[29] \\nThis appeal has no chance of success.  A further hearing in the OCJ has no chance of \\nsuccess.  The process of summary dismissal was created for precisely this type of case – one that \\nhas no possibility of success regardless of how much time and effort is spent on the matter. \\n[30] \\nThis appeal is dismissed. \\n \\n \\nReleased: March 27, 2024 \\nParfett J. \\n2024 ONSC 1822 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\nCITATION: R. v.

In this application, Mehdi seeks broad relief against Soraya and \\nchallenges the validity of the 1999 Will. \\n[3] \\nEach party brought a motion: \\n(a) A motion by Soraya under Rule 75.06 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, \\nReg. 194, for a declaration that the Applicant has failed to meet the minimal \\nevidentiary threshold to call into question the validity of the 1999 Will, an order that \\nthis Application be dismissed or, alternatively, an order directing that this Application \\nbe heard as a summary trial (“Soraya’s Rule 75.06 Motion”). \\n(b) A motion by Mehdi for three remedies: an order granting leave for the issuance of a \\ncertificate of pending litigation for registration against title to real properties owned \\nby the Deceased or in which the Deceased held an interest (the “CPL Issue”); an order \\npreserving assets held by the Estate (the “Preservation Issue”); and an order removing \\nSoraya as estate trustee and appointing an estate trustee during litigation (the “ETDL \\nIssue”) (collectively, “Mehdi’s Motion”). \\n[4] \\nI directed that Soraya’s Rule 75.06 Motion be determined first and that Mehdi’s Motion \\nwould then be scheduled for hearing. On the basis of the reasons set out herein, I order that \\nSoraya’s Rule 75.06 Motion is dismissed. \\nI. \\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \\n[5] \\nOn June 18, 2021, Soraya filed an application in Newmarket, probate file 2021-01272 (the \\n“2021 Probate Application”), for a Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee without a Will of \\nthe estate of Sadollah Zarrinmehr (the “Estate”). Soraya submitted that no will had been located \\nfor the Deceased. Soraya, Mehdi and Maral were listed in the 2021 Probate Application as \\n“Persons Entitled to Share in the Estate”, which was stated to have a value of $1,214,425.00. By \\nConsent executed on June 18, 2021, Mehdi agreed to Soraya’s appointment as Estate Trustee, as \\ndid Maral. On November 16, 2021, a Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee without a Will \\n(“CAET Without a Will”) was issued to Soraya. \\n[6] \\nBy letter dated April 6, 2022, the lawyer for Mehdi wrote to Soraya’s probate lawyer, \\nAzadeh Nourbakhsh Lavictoire, and raised two inquiries: first, whether the Deceased may, in fact, \\nhave executed a will; and second, whether all steps had been completed to investigate and locate \\nany such will. Ms. Nourbakhsh Lavictoire responded with details of the searches had been made \\nto locate a will for the Deceased, without result. \\n[7] \\nThe parties then commenced competing applications. \\n[8] \\nOn November 16, 2022, Soraya issued, with the assistance of new counsel, Lisbeth \\nHollman and Earl S. Heiber, an application in Newmarket court file number CV-22-00003784-\\n0000 (the “2022 Soraya Application”) for orders revoking the CAET Without a Will and issuing \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n3 \\n \\n \\na Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee with a Will (“CAET With a Will”). Soraya set out \\nto propound the 1999 Will.  \\n[9] \\nIn her affidavit sworn October 28, 2022 in support of the 2022 Soraya Application, Soraya \\nswore as follows: “Subsequent to obtaining the Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee \\nwithout a Will, I located my husband’s original Law (sic) Will and Testament dated September \\n30, 1999.” Ms. Nourbakhsh Lavictoire swore, in an affidavit in support of the 2022 Soraya \\nApplication, that Mr. Heiber’s office notified her that after the issuance of the CAET Without a \\nWill, Soraya “had located the deceased’s original Law (sic) Will and Testament dated September \\n30, 1999.”  The 1999 Will was exhibited to the affidavits of Soraya and Ms. Nourbakhsh \\nLavictoire. The affidavits of subscribing witnesses to the 1999 Will were not signed \\ncontemporaneous with the execution of the 1999 Will, but were executed by the witnesses, Amir \\nHomayoun Hashemi and Assadollah Zarrinmehr some 23 years later, on August 3, 2022, through \\nthe offices of Mr. Heiber. \\n[10] \\nThe Notice of Application in the 2022 Soraya Application stated, erroneously, that the \\nDeceased “left behind no children”. \\n[11] \\nThere is no dispute that Soraya did not provide Mehdi with the 1999 Will and the Amended \\nNotice of Application in the 2022 Soraya Application until February 28, 2023. Ms. Hollman \\ndeposed that on this day, the litigation lawyer for Soraya told her that the Notice of Application \\nerroneously stated that the Deceased “left behind no children”, and that they discussed that the \\n2022 Soraya Application had to be served on Medhi and Maral. Soraya’s counsel then set out to \\namend the 2022 Soraya Application. \\n[12] \\nIn the meantime, on February 9, 2023, without knowledge that Soraya had located a will, \\nMehdi initiated this application against Soraya in court file number CV-23-00694490-00ES (“this \\nApplication”), seeking orders or directions that include the following: \\n(a) In paragraphs 1(a)-(c), orders requiring Soraya to account as estate trustee, and to \\ndisclose all assets belonging to the Estate. \\n(b) In paragraphs 1(e) and (f), an order removing Soraya as Estate Trustee and appointing \\nan estate trustee during litigation (“ETDL”) (the “Claim for an ETDL”). \\n(c) In paragraphs 1(g) and (h), orders requiring the production of legal, financial, and \\nother documents relating to the Deceased and the Estate (the “Claim for Production”). \\n(d) In paragraphs 1(d) and (k), a declaration of constructive trust or resulting trust \\nregarding four properties and shares owned by the Deceased, or in which the Deceased \\nis alleged to have had an interest (the “Claim in Resulting Trust”). \\n(e) In paragraph 1(j), an order granting leave for the issue of a Certificate of Pending \\nLitigation (“CPL”) against title to certain properties owned by the Deceased, or in \\nwhich the Deceased is alleged to have had an interest (the “Claim for a CPL”). \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n4 \\n \\n \\n(f) In paragraph 1(i): “If required, the Court’s opinion, advice, and direction as to the \\nvalidity and contents of a purported Will of the Deceased that has been lost or \\ndestroyed and an Order proving the validity and contents of the Deceased’s Will that \\nhas been lost or destroyed.” \\n[13] \\nAs the Applicant was not aware at the time of issuance of this Application that Soraya was \\npropounding the 1999 Will, this Application, in its original Notice of Application, did not \\nchallenge the 1999 Will. Mehdi could not challenge a will that was not known to him. After Mehdi \\nwas notified by Soraya of the 1999 Will on February 28, 2023, Mehdi amended his Notice of \\nApplication on March 24, 2023 to plead the following: \\n(a) Paragraph 1(i) was amended as follows: “If required, the Court’s opinion, advice, and \\ndirection as to the validity and contents including interpretation of any purported Will \\nof the Deceased, including any Will that has been lost or destroyed and an Order \\nproving the validity and contents of any of the Deceased’s Wills, including any Will \\nthat has been lost or destroyed”. \\n(b) Paragraph 1(h) was amended as follows: “An Order that Earl S. Heiber and Harry \\nGreenberg make such disclosure as the Court deems appropriate of his all their file \\nmaterials and recollections relating to the Deceased and attend for examinations”. \\n(c) The following grounds were added: \\n“On February 28, 2023, counsel for Soraya notified the Applicant that a \\npurported testamentary instrument of the Deceased had been located, \\ndated September 30, 1999, and that Soraya had issued an Amended Notice \\nof Application for Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee with a \\nWill on November 16, 2022. A copy of the purported testamentary \\ninstrument was sent to the Applicant’s counsel; however, the document is \\nmissing pages and contains inconsistencies in the paragraph numbering \\nwhich call into question the validity of the purported September 30, 1999 \\nWill. \\nIn light of the above, the Applicant has reason to believe that the \\ndocument being put forward by Soraya as the purported last Will of the \\nDeceased is not a genuine document and its content has been modified. \\nAdditionally, the terms of the purported September 30, 1999 Will, are \\ninconsistent regarding how the Estate is to be divided and therefore void \\ndue to ambiguity in the terms.” \\n[14] \\nOn March 3, 2023, three days after Soraya notified Mehdi of the 2022 Soraya Application, \\nbefore Soraya amended her 2022 Application to correct the omission of Mehdi and Maral as \\nchildren of the Deceased, and before Mehdi filed a Notice of Objection to Soraya’s 2022 \\nApplication, Justice Sutherland ordered that a Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee with a \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n5 \\n \\n \\nWill be issued to Soraya on the basis that the Applicant had filed an affidavit of execution of the \\n1999 Will and that “there are no other beneficiaries”. The 2023 Certificate of Appointment of an \\nEstate Trustee with a Will (the “2023 CAET With a Will”) was issued on the 2022 Soraya \\nApplication that incorrectly stated that Soraya was the only beneficiary of the Estate. \\n[15] \\nOn March 10, 2023, Mehdi filed a Notice of Objection in the 2022 Soraya Application. \\nThe Notice of Objection was rejected by the Court in Newmarket on the basis that it was filed late. \\nThe Court had already issued the 2023 CAET With a Will. \\nII. \\nCOURT ORDERS \\nA. Orders at Case Conferences \\n[16] \\nOn March 7, 2023, the parties attended a Scheduling Appointment in this Application. \\nJustice Gilmore directed that “the Applicant will file a Notice of Objection in the Newmarket \\nApplication [the 2022 Soraya Application] which will have the effect of staying that Application. \\nThe matter will then move forward on the within Application issued in Toronto.” Justice Gilmore \\ndirected that the parties discuss the timetabling of their Motions and return to a Case Conference \\non March 23, 2023. In the interim, Justice Gilmore ordered that “there shall be no dealings with \\nany of the [real properties in which the Deceased is alleged to have had an interest]” and that “the \\nissue of a further no dealings/preservation Order may be revisited on March 23, 2023”. \\n[17] \\nOn March 23, 2023, Justice Gilmore suggested that the parties prepare a draft Order for \\nthe dismissal of the 2022 Soraya Application. The parties did not do so but agreed to treat the 2022 \\nSoraya Application as stayed. Justice Gilmore granted an Order prohibiting dealings regarding five \\nof the six properties that are in dispute in this Application (referenced by their identification in a \\nChart filed by the parties) as follows (the “No Dealings Order”): \\n1. Properties 1 [29 Pleasant Avenue, Toronto, PIN 10139-0175(LT)] and \\n4 [10303 Yonge Street, Richmond Hill, PIN 03172-0116(LT)] will \\ncontinue to be subject to the no dealings Order until the motions are \\ndisposed of. \\n2. The Respondent will give 60-days’ notice of any intention to deal with \\nProperty 3 [921-7805 Bayview Avenue, Thornhill, PIN 293314-\\n0211(LT)]. \\n3. The parties agree that Property 2 [PH 10-275 Yorkland Road, Toronto, \\nPIN 76400-0443(LT)] is no longer subject to the no dealings Order. \\n4. Property 6 [3809-2015 Sheppard Avenue East, Toronto, PIN 76345-\\n0427(LT)] has been sold. The funds in the Estate account will remain \\nsubject to the no dealings order except as required for legal and \\naccounting fees with respect to the ongoing litigation related to \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n6 \\n \\n \\nProperty 1. Counsel for the Respondent to provide an accounting of \\nlegal and accounting fees. \\n5. Property 5 [1120-7905 Bayview Avenue, Thornhill, PIN 29328-\\n0252(LT)] has been sold. Any remaining proceeds are subject to the \\nno dealings Order. \\n[18] \\nOn October 23, 2023, Justice Dietrich ordered that the No Dealings Order be extended to \\nJanuary 23, 2024. \\nB. The Continuation of the No Dealings Order \\n[19] \\nAt the hearing on January 23, 2024, the parties consented to the continuation of the No \\nDealings Order until the conclusion of Soraya’s Motion and Mehdi’s Motion with modification to \\nSoraya’s authority to deal with Property 4 and Property 5, as follows (the “Restated No Dealings \\nOrder”): \\n1. Properties 1 [29 Pleasant Avenue, Toronto, PIN 10139-0175(LT)] and \\n4 [10303 Yonge Street, Richmond Hill, PIN 03172-0116(LT)] will \\ncontinue to be subject to the no dealings Order until the motions are \\ndisposed of. Regarding Property 4, if there are any shareholder \\ndistributions, the Respondent will hold 25% in the Estate account as an \\nEstate asset but may release the 25% owned by the Respondent. \\n… \\n5. Property 5 [1120-7905 Bayview Avenue, Thornhill, PIN 29328-\\n0252(LT)] has been sold. Any remaining proceeds are subject to the \\nno dealings Order except that the Respondent is permitted to use funds \\nfor daily expenses. \\n[20] \\nOn the consent of the parties, an Order shall issue for the implementation of the Restated \\nNo Dealings Order until the determination of Soraya’s Motion and Mehdi’s Motion. \\nIII. \\nTHIS MOTION \\nA. Principles Applicable to Soraya’s Motion \\n[21] \\nRule 75 governs contentious proceedings in estates. Rule 75.01 provides that an estate \\ntrustee or an “interested person” may bring an application to have a testamentary instrument proved \\n“in such manner as the court directs”, as follows: \\n75.01 An estate trustee or any person appearing to have a financial interest \\nin an estate may make an application under rule 75.06 to have a \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n7 \\n \\n \\ntestamentary instrument that is being put forward as the last will of the \\ndeceased proved in such manner as the court directs. \\n[22] \\nRule 75.06(1) provides an interested person with the right to apply or move for directions.  \\n[23] \\nIn Neuberger Estate v. York, 2016 ONCA 191, 129 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 77, the Court of \\nAppeal explained that to prove a will in solemn form, the person propounding the will must prove, \\nin open court upon notice to all interest persons, “that the will was duly executed, the testator had \\ntestamentary capacity and that the testator had knowledge and approval of the contents of the will.” \\nThe person propounding the will has “the legal burden of proof with respect to due execution, \\nknowledge and approval and testamentary capacity”, after which there is a rebuttable presumption \\nof validity: Neuberger, at para. 78, referring to Vout v. Hay, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 876, at paras. 26-27. \\n[24] \\nThe Court of Appeal considered in Neuberger whether an interested person has an \\n“automatic right” to have a will proved in solemn form. The Court of Appeal accepted, at para. 82, \\nthat “as a general principle, before probate issues an interested person has the right to request \\nformal proof of the testamentary instrument” … but the Court of Appeal did “not accept that this \\ngeneral principle means that the interested person is entitled, as of right, to require that the \\ntestamentary instrument be proved in solemn form.” Rather, the Court of Appeal explained, at \\npara. 88, that an interested person must meet some minimal evidentiary threshold before a court \\nwill require that a will be proven in solemn form: \\nIn my view, an interested person must meet some minimal evidentiary \\nthreshold before a court will accede to a request that a testamentary \\ninstrument be proved. In the absence of some minimal evidentiary \\nthreshold, estates would necessarily be exposed to needless expense and \\nlitigation. In the case of small estates, this could conceivably deplete the \\nestate. Furthermore, it would be unfair to require an estate trustee to defend \\na testamentary instrument simply because a disgruntled relative or other \\npotential beneficiary makes a request for proof in solemn form. \\n[25] \\nTo meet this burden, the party requesting that the testamentary instrument be proved, must \\npoint to some evidence that would call into question the validity of the testamentary instrument \\nbeing propounded, as explained at para. 89 of Neuberger, as follows: \\nBased on the above analysis, in my view, an applicant or moving party \\nunder rule 75.06 must adduce, or point to, some evidence which, if \\naccepted, would call into question the validity of the testamentary \\ninstrument that is being propounded. If the applicant or moving party fails \\nin that regard or if the propounder of the testamentary instrument \\nsuccessfully answers the challenge, then the application or motion should \\nbe dismissed. If, on the other hand, the applicant or moving party adduces \\nor points to evidence that calls into question the validity of the \\ntestamentary instrument which the propounder does not successfully \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n8 \\n \\n \\nanswer, the court would generally order that the testamentary instrument \\nbe proved. \\n[26] \\nThe “minimal evidentiary threshold” standard for applications for wills to be proved in \\nsolemn form was applied by Justice Myers in Seepa v. Seepa, 2017 ONSC 5368, by the Court of \\nAppeal in Johnson v. Johnson, 2022 ONCA 682, 81 E.T.R. (4th) 7 and then by Justice Myers in \\nthree decisions in 2023: Giann v. Giannopoulos, 2023 ONSC 5412; Carinci v. Carinci, 2023 \\nONSC 6094; and Dinally v. Dinally, 2023 ONSC 6178. In argument, the moving party relied on \\nGilbert v. Girouard, 2023 ONSC 4445, Dimakarakos v. Alimena, 2022 ONSC 4386 and Young v. \\nPrychitko, 2021 ONSC 3150. From a survey of this jurisprudence, the following principles emerge \\nregarding the application of the minimal evidentiary threshold: \\n(a)  The burden is on the Applicant to adduce some evidence which, if accepted, would \\ncall into question the validity of the will: Neuberger, at para. 89; Johnson, at paras. 8 \\nand 12; Giann, at para. 18. \\n(b) The evidence adduced by the Applicant does not need to be proved at the time of \\nestablishing the minimal evidentiary threshold. The evidence must support the claim \\nif accepted at a dispositive hearing, but “the preliminary vetting process is not to be \\nconfused with making findings of fact at trial”: Giann, at paras. 18 and 25. \\n(c) The evidentiary threshold is low, and proof of the case on the merits or meeting the \\nstandard of a genuine issue requiring a trial is not required: Johnson, at para. 17; \\nSeepa, at para. 35; Gilbert, at para. 29, citing Morrish v. Katona. 2021 ONSC 3805; \\nMartin v. Martin, 2018 ONSC 1840, at para. 35. \\n(d)  If the Applicant establishes evidence supporting the request for the will challenge, \\nthe responding party has an opportunity to answer the evidence and, if the responding \\nparty does so successfully, the will challenge is dismissed: Neuberger, at para. 89; \\nJohnson, at para. 8; Giann, at para. 17. \\n(e) Bald or conclusory assertions of wrongdoing alleged by the party challenging the will, \\nand bare allegations and mere suspicions are insufficient to satisfy the minimal \\nevidentiary threshold: Giann, at para. 108; Dimakarakos, at para. 19; Gilbert, at para. \\n27; Dinally, at para. 39. \\n[27] \\nThese principles inform my analysis of Soraya’s Rule 75.06 Motion. \\nB. Analysis \\n(a) Proof of the Validity of the Will \\n[28] \\nSoraya did not dispute, in my view correctly, that Mehdi is an interested person in his \\nfather’s estate. Mehdi is an “interested person” in the Estate because he is the Deceased’s son and \\nhas a financial interest in the Estate in the case of an intestacy: Neuberger, at para. 74. Mehdi \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n9 \\n \\n \\ncontends that there is the potential that he also has a financial interest in the Estate through a will \\nthat has not been located, notwithstanding that Soraya affirms the 1999 Will is valid. \\n[29] \\nThe parties also did not disagree on the principles that are summarized above applicable to \\nthe determination to Soraya’s Rule 75.06(1) Motion. The parties’ disagreement was in the \\napplication of these principles to this motion. \\n[30] \\nThe Respondent submitted that an order should issue dismissing this Application on the \\nbasis that Mehdi did not meet the minimal evidentiary threshold to call into question the validity \\nof the 1999 Will. I do not accept this submission. I will explain why. \\n[31] \\nThe Court’s jurisdiction in probate is inquisitorial: Neuberger, at para. 68. In carrying out \\nits inquiry into the validity of the will, the Court has a special responsibility to the testator who \\ncannot be present to be heard: Neuberger, at para. 118: “…the court has a responsibility to ensure \\nthat only wills that meet the hallmarks of validity are probated. It owes that duty to the testators \\nwhose death precludes them from protecting their own interests, to those with a legitimate interest \\nin the estate, and to the public at large.” \\n[32] \\nThe inquiry into the validity of the Will begins with the propounder of the Will, in this case \\nSoraya, discharging her burden to prove that the Will was duly signed, that the testator had capacity \\nwhen the will was executed and that the testator understood and approved the content of the will: \\nNeuberger, at para. 77, applying Vout, at p. 737. If the objector to the will establishes suspicious \\ncircumstances, the burden to prove the will reverts to the propounder to prove the testator’s \\nknowledge, approval and capacity in execution of the will, but the objector bears throughout the \\nburden of establishing any allegation of undue influence: Neuberger, at para. 78. \\n[33] \\nThis is where this case differs from those referred to earlier. The will challenges in \\nNeuberger, Seepa, Johnson, Giann, Carinci, Dinally, and Gilbert were not based on whether the \\ntestator had executed the will, or whether the will was properly witnessed and was genuine. The \\ndispute in those cases was whether the will should be proved in solemn form by reason of alleged \\nincapacity on the part of the testator, undue influence, or suspicious circumstances apart from \\nconsiderations pertaining to the form and execution of the will.  \\n[34] \\nHere, Mehdi does not allege that his father was incapable or under undue influence in 1999 \\nas the basis for requiring that the 1999 Will be proved by Soraya. Mehdi alleges that Soraya, as \\npropounder of the 1999 Will, has not discharged her burden of proving that the will was validly \\nexecuted and that the 1999 Will is the valid will of the Deceased. Mehdi alleges, further, that a \\nbasic reading of anomalies contained in the 1999 Will supported by the admissible evidence \\nsurrounding the execution of the Will is sufficient to establish suspicious circumstances to meet \\nthe minimal evidentiary threshold. Mehdi submitted that these suspicious circumstances were not \\nrebutted by Soraya, who tendered the affidavit of subscribing witnesses to the 1999 Will to \\nestablish the witnessing of the will but declined to cross-examine these witnesses and sought to \\nexclude their evidence on the circumstances surrounding their witnessing of the will. \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n10 \\n \\n \\n[35] \\nA plain reading of the 1999 Will shows that it is less than perfect in form and execution. \\nSome examples of anomalies in the 1999 Will are as follows: \\n(a) The 1999 Will is missing sub-paragraphs III(c)-(f). Rather the 1999 Will contains sub-\\nparagraphs III(a) and (b) and then sub-paragraphs III(g)-(j). \\n(b) The 1999 Will contains a second paragraph numbered III(g) and a second paragraph \\nnumbered III(h). \\n(c) The 1999 Will is missing sub-paragraphs IV(b), IV(c) and IV(d). Rather, the 1999 \\nWill contains sub-paragraph IV(a) and then sub-paragraph IV(e)-(f). \\n(d) The pages of the 1999 Will do not contain page numbers. Soraya submitted that the \\nnon-paginated 1999 Will consists of five pages in total, assembled in sequence by \\nfollowing the order of the parts of the 1999 Will. \\n(e) On the execution page of the 1999 Will, the testator is said to declare that he has “to \\nthis my last Will and Testament, written upon this and seven preceding pages of \\npaper, subscribed my name this 30th day of September, 1999” [emphasis added]. The \\n1999 Will does not contain seven preceding pages of paper. It contains four preceding \\npages. \\n[36] \\nThe Respondent minimized these anomalies as mere, innocuous typographical errors, that \\nare easily reconciled. The Respondent submitted that when the entirety of the 1999 Will is \\ninterpreted in a “commercially reasonable” manner, its contents are clear. Furthermore, the \\nRespondent proffers in evidence her own will, which has similar and, in some respects, identical \\ncontent to the 1999 Will and shares certain anomalies. Like the 1999 Will, Soraya’s will is \\nunpaginated and declares that the will contains seven pages when it has only four. As an additional \\nanomaly, Soraya’s will is undated. \\n[37] \\nI do not accept Soraya’s submission that Mehdi failed to establish that the 1999 Will \\nrequires no further inquiry to establish its validity, for the following reasons.  First, the numerous \\nanomalies in the 1999 Will call into question the integrity and validity of the Will. I am not \\npersuaded that Mehdi’s request to investigate the validity of the 1999 Will is answered by Soraya’s \\nsubmission that the 1999 Will is propped up by similarities in her will.  \\n[38] \\nSecond, Mehdi discharged his burden of showing, through the anomalies in the 1999 Will \\nand the evidence of the subscribing witnesses, sufficient evidence to meet the minimal evidentiary \\nthreshold for this Will to be proved. I will explain why. \\n[39] \\nThe subscribing witnesses to the 1999 Will are Amir Homayoun Hashemi, who is related \\nto the Deceased through marriage, and Assadollah Zarrinmehr (“Mr. Zarrinmehr”), who is the \\nbrother of the deceased and thereby Mehdi’s uncle. The 1999 Will is not supported by a \\ncontemporaneous affidavit of subscribing witness. Soraya tendered an affidavit of subscribing \\nwitness executed by Mr. Hashemi on August 3, 2022, by which Mr. Hashemi swore that the \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n11 \\n \\n \\nDeceased executed the 1999 Will in his presence and in the presence of Mr. Zarrinmehr on \\nSeptember 30, 1999 (the “August 2022 Hashemi Affidavit”). The August 2022 Hashemi Affidavit \\nwas tendered by Soraya in furtherance of her burden to establish the validity of execution of the \\n1999 Will. \\n[40] \\n In responding to Soraya’s Rule 75.06 Motion, Mehdi tendered an affidavit sworn by Mr. \\nHashemi on April 12, 2023 (the “April 2023 Hashemi Affidavit”) and an affidavit sworn by Mr. \\nZarrinmehr the same day (the “April 2023 Zarrinmehr Affidavit”). Mr. Hashemi and Mr. \\nZarrinmehr deposed that they witnessed the execution by the Deceased of a will on September 30, \\n1999, but they did not read the contents of the will at that time. They swore to their understanding \\nof the Deceased’s intention in making his will based on statements made by the Deceased at the \\nmoment of execution of the will. The evidence of these subscribing witnesses of the Deceased’s \\nintention in making his will is not reflected in the 1999 Will. \\n[41] \\nSoraya relied on the August 2022 Hashemi Affidavit to establish due execution by the \\nDeceased of the 1999 Will, but objected to the admissibility of the evidence in the April 2023 \\nHashemi Affidavit and the April 2023 Zarrinmehr Affidavit on the basis that extrinsic evidence of \\nthe testator’s intentions is inadmissible in will interpretation, relying on the principles set out in \\nRondel v. Robinson Estate, 2011 ONCA 493, 106 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 17, and John Kaptyn \\nEstate (Re), 2010 ONSC 4293, 102 O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 36. \\n[42] \\nI do not accept the Respondent’s submission that I should rely on Mr. Hashemi’s August \\n2022 Affidavit to find that the 1999 Will was validly witnessed by Mr. Hashemi and Mr. \\nZarrinmehr but that I should exclude these witnesses from being heard on the circumstances that \\nthey perceived at the time that they witnessed the execution of the will. Soraya’s objection to the \\nadmissibility of the evidence of Mr. Hashemi and Mr. Zarrinmehr was misplaced considering the \\npurpose for which the evidence was tendered. \\n[43] \\nThe evidence of Mr. Hashemi and Mr. Zarrinmehr was not tendered in aid of interpretation \\nor rectification of the 1999 Will. Their evidence was tendered in support of Mehdi’s submission \\nthat there are suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the 1999 Will, including that \\nthe four pages attached to the execution page witnessed by Mr. Hashemi and Mr. Zarrinmehr might \\nnot be the same as the “preceding seven pages” declared by the testator to constitute his will. Put \\nsimply, their evidence was tendered in support of Mehdi’s position that the 1999 Will is not \\ngenuine and that the Deceased might have executed another will.  \\n[44] \\nThis evidence does not have to be proved for the purpose of this Rule 75.06 motion, but \\nrather need only be evidence that supports the claim if proven at trial. The evidence of Mr. Hashemi \\nand Mr. Zarrinmehr of the surrounding circumstances in the Deceased’s execution of the 1999 \\nWill supports that Applicant’s claim of suspicious circumstances. In reference to principles of \\nadmissibility of evidence for will interpretation and rectification, evidence of surrounding \\ncircumstances at the time of the making of a will is admissible: Robinson Estate, at para. 27; \\nIhnatowych Estate v. Ihnatowych, 2024 ONCA 142, at para. 37; Trezzi v. Trezzi, 2019 ONCA 978, \\nat para. 13; Ross v. Canada Trust Company, 2021 ONCA 161, at paras. 37-38. \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n12 \\n \\n \\n[45] \\nLast, Mehdi’s suspicion regarding the Deceased’s execution of the 1999 Will is \\naccentuated by consideration of the Deceased’s qualifications. At the time of the execution of the \\n1999 Will, the Deceased was a professor who held a Master’s degree in law. He would go on later \\nto obtain a doctorate degree in law. The anomalies in the 1999 Will are patent. The Deceased’s \\nadvanced legal education, training and experience with written materials supports suspicion on \\nwhether the glaring anomalies in the 1999 Will would have gone unnoticed or noticed but \\ncountenanced by the Deceased at the time that the 1999 Will was executed. \\n[46] \\nI find, on the anomalous nature of the 1999 Will and on the evidence of the circumstances \\nof the execution of the Will, including that provided by the subscribing witnesses which I accept \\nfor the purposes of this motion, that Mehdi has satisfied the minimal evidentiary threshold \\nnecessary to require proof of the 1999 Will. I make this finding without reliance on the affidavit \\nevidence of Mehdi and of the other family members (Azardokht Zarrin Mehr, Behrdad Zarrin \\nMehr and Nasrollah Zarrin Mehr) on the Deceased’s testamentary intentions, as unnecessary to \\nmy determination of Soraya’s Rule 75.06 Motion. It is thereby unnecessary to rule on the \\nadmissibility of this affidavit evidence. \\n[47] \\n Since the moving party has established evidence supporting the will challenge, the burden \\nshifted to Soraya to answer the evidence. She did not. First, Soraya did not cross-examine Mr. \\nHashemi and Mr. Zarrinmehr on their affidavit evidence of April 12, 2023. Second, Soraya did not \\ntender any evidence from the lawyer who is alleged to have drafted the Will, Nathan Sritharan, \\neven though that lawyer is available to provide evidence. The Respondent did not show whether \\nthe lawyer’s file was available or of any steps taken to adduce this evidence. The Respondent did \\nnot explain how Mr. Sritharan came to provide the Will to Soraya, and whether there was any \\ninvestigation or explanation to support its validity considering the anomalies in the 1999 Will.  \\n[48] \\nLastly, I have considered the scope of the evidence sought by Mehdi in contesting the \\nvalidity of the 1999 Will. Mehdi seeks evidence from four sources. First, Mehdi seeks production \\nof the will drafting file and evidence from the will drafting lawyer, Nathan Sritharan. Second, \\nMehdi seeks production of the probate estate file of Ms. Nourbakhsh Lavictoire regarding the \\ninvestigations that resulted in the conclusion that the Deceased left no will, and the evidence \\nregarding the provenance of the 1999 Will. Third, Mehdi seeks the probate file of Mr. Heiber for \\nsimilar reasons.  \\n[49] \\nFourth, Mehdi seeks production from Mr. Harry Greenberg, a lawyer who retired in 2019. \\nMehdi has produced a Power of Attorney for Property and a Power of Attorney for Personal Care, \\nboth dated November 5, 2003, witnessed by people at the address of Mr. Greenberg’s former \\noffice. Similar documents were prepared for Soraya. These estate planning documents post-date \\nthe 1999 Will. Mr. Greenberg wrote in an email of February 9, 2021, that he acted for the Deceased \\nin about 20 real estate transactions between 2017 and the 20 years preceding, and that he reviewed \\nhis index of files and “can find no reference to any last wills and testaments …  related to Mr. \\nZarrinmehr.” Mr. Greenberg is not agreeable to release of his real estate files but wrote that he was \\nprepared to have Mehdi’s counsel “review any file in my presence at a location of my choice and \\nat a cost for my time and file retrieval.” \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n13 \\n \\n \\n[50] \\nMehdi is no longer seeking from Mr. Heiber and Mr. Greenberg the scope of production \\npleaded in paragraph 1(h) of his Notice of Application, as follows: “An Order that Earl S. Heiber \\nand Harry Greenberg make such disclosure as the Court deems appropriate of all their file \\nmaterials and recollections relating to the Deceased and attend for examinations” [emphasis \\nadded]. Instead, Mehdi seeks an order that Mr. Greenberg review his records to determine whether \\nthere is an estate planning file, or any evidence of advice on estate planning or will preparation \\nsubsumed in any non-estate planning file, and to so depose by affidavit. Mehdi stated that he is \\nprepared to pay the costs associated with these searches. \\n[51] \\nIn my view, these four areas of production do not contravene the caution that the court \\nshould be reluctant to put “an estate to the needless expense of a fishing expedition”, as stated in \\nJohnson, at para. 16 and Seepa, at para. 49. These areas of production are consistent with the \\nproportionate production of evidence regarding the validity of the 1999 Will and the exhaustion of \\nthe search of any other will, through the “use of a scalpel rather than a mallet” as encouraged by \\nthe Court in Seepa.  \\n(b) Conclusions \\n[52] \\nThe Court of Appeal instructed in Johnson, at para. 17, that a Rule 75.06 Motion to dismiss \\na will challenge for failure to meet minimal evidentiary threshold is “not a motion for summary \\njudgment requiring proof of the case on the merits or meeting the standard of a genuine issue \\nrequiring a trial.” Rather, adopting Justice Myers’s finding in Seepa, at para. 35, “[a]t this \\npreliminary stage, the issue is not whether the applicant has proven his or her case but whether he \\nor she ought to be given tools, such as documentary discovery, that are ordinarily available to a \\nlitigant before he or she is subjected to a requirement to put a best foot forward on the merits”. \\n[53] \\nSoraya’s Rule 75.06 Motion is dismissed on my finding that the Applicant has established \\nthe minimal evidentiary threshold to challenge the validity of the 1999 Will, considering that the \\nwill challenge is based on anomalies in the 1999 Will and suspicious circumstances that were not \\nrebutted by the moving party. \\n[54] \\nConsidering the dismissal of the Rule 75.06 Motion, the Applicant may now proceed to \\nseek production from the Deceased’s former lawyers and the probate lawyers. I am not prepared \\nto grant the production orders sought by the Applicant at this time, as the lawyers from whom \\nproduction is sought must be provided with notice and an opportunity to speak to the production \\nsought from them. The Applicant may schedule the hearing of this Motion, on notice. I direct that \\nthe lawyers for the parties arrange for the scheduling of a Case Conference to be held before me, \\nto address the scheduling of the following: (a) the Applicant’s motion for production on notice to \\nthe lawyers from whom production is sought; and (b) Mehdi’s Motion.   \\nIV. \\nDISPOSITION \\n[55] \\nI order as follows: \\n2024 ONSC 1754 (CanLII)\\n14 \\n \\n \\n(a) The Motion by the Respondent, Soraya Shokrai, for a declaration that the Applicant \\nhas failed to meet the minimal evidentiary threshold to call into question the validity \\nof the 1999 Will and an Order that this Application be dismissed, is dismissed. \\n(b) The lawyers for the parties shall arrange for a Case Conference to be held, under Rule \\n50.13, to attend before me to schedule the hearing of the following: \\n(i) \\nThe Applicant’s motion for production from lawyers Azadeh Nourbakhsh \\nLavictoire, Earl S.

The \\nApplicant may seek an order under Rules 75.04 and 75.05 to revoke the \\nCertificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee issued in court file number CV-\\n22-00003784-0000 and to cause the Certificate to be returned to the court \\n(the “Applicant’s Motion”). \\n(c) On the consent of the parties, the parties shall, until the determination of the \\nApplicant’s Motion or further order of the Court, preserve the following properties in \\ndispute in this Application in accordance with the following terms (the “Restated No \\nDealings Order”): \\n(i) \\nProperties 1 [29 Pleasant Avenue, Toronto, PIN 10139-0175(LT)] and 4 \\n[10303 Yonge Street, Richmond Hill, PIN 03172-0116(LT)] will continue \\nto be subject to the no dealings Order until the motions are disposed of. \\nRegarding Property 4, if there are any shareholder distributions, the \\nRespondent will hold 25% in the Estate account as an Estate asset but may \\nrelease the 25% owned by the Respondent. \\n(ii) \\nThe Respondent will give 60-days’ notice of any intention to deal with \\nProperty 3 [921-7805 Bayview Avenue, Thornhill, PIN 293314-0211(LT)]. \\n(iii) Property 2 [PH 10-275 Yorkland Road, Toronto, PIN 76400-0443(LT)] is \\nno longer subject to the no dealings Order. \\n(iv) Property 6 [3809-2015 Sheppard Avenue East, Toronto, PIN 76345-\\n0427(LT)] has been sold.

If the parties cannot \\nagree on the issue of costs of this Motion, any party seeking costs may, at the Case Conference to \\nbe scheduled, speak to a process for the determination of the issue of costs. In this event, the parties \\nshall include a term to this effect in their draft Order.   \\n[57] \\nThe Applicant may prepare and, after approval as to form and content by the Respondent, \\nfile on the CaseLines bundle for this hearing (004) a draft Order consistent with this disposition \\nand may then forward the draft Order by email to the Estates List Trial Coordinator, to be brought \\nto my attention.

The observations were made months after the \\narrest of the children’s father and their subsequent removal from the home of their mother, and \\nsome months after they began to live with S.O. and her family. \\nFacts \\n[2] \\n \\nThe father and mother are the accused in this case and are charged with physical \\nand sexual abuse of six of their eight children. \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n[3] \\n \\nP.B. is the mother of K., B., G., M., and B.E. \\n[4] \\n \\nM.O. is the father of C., H., L., G., M., and B.E. \\n[5] \\n \\nM. was born April 20, 2014. \\n[6] \\n \\nG. was born April 30, 2012. \\n[7] \\n \\nL. and H. are twins born August 27, 2007.  \\n[8] \\n \\nL. is not an alleged victim of either physical or sexual abuse. \\n[9] \\n \\nWith respect to M., G., and H., the Indictment alleges as follows: \\n1. With respect to M., both of the accused are charged with touching her for a sexual \\npurpose between January 1, 2018 and August 22, 2019. M.O. is charged with \\nassaulting her on August 22, 2019. \\n2. With respect to G., the accused are charged with touching her for a sexual purpose \\nbetween January 1, 2018 and August 22, 2019. They are charged with inviting her \\nfor a sexual purpose to touch a person between January 1, 2018 and August 22, \\n2019. \\n3. With respect to H., M.O. is charged with assaulting her between July 1, 2017 and \\nJuly 31, 2017.  \\n[10] \\n \\nM.O. was arrested August 22, 2019. \\n[11] \\n \\nThe children were removed from the care of their mother, P.B., on October 29, \\n2019. \\n[12] \\n \\nSince that time, the children have lived with other family members and their \\nfamilies. In particular, M. and G. have lived with their aunt C.O. and her family, and began living \\nwith their aunt S.O. and her husband and their four children commencing on May 1, 2020. Her \\nchildren are 22, 15, 13, and 11 years old. They continue to live with their aunt S.O. The evidence \\nof S.O. is that while the children lived with their own family, she would see them a few times a \\nyear: Easter, Christmas, Thanksgiving, when she babysat, and at special church functions, such as \\na confirmation. \\n[13] \\n \\nL. and H. have lived with aunt H.E. and with S.O. and their families.  \\n[14] \\n \\nM. and G. have already testified in this trial. \\nBrief Summaries of the Evidence Given by Three of the Child Complainants at Trial \\n[15] \\n \\nI summarize this evidence very briefly insofar as it is relevant to the voir dire. I \\nhave made no assessment of credibility or reliability or considered the challenges to the evidence \\narising from cross-examination or otherwise for the purposes of this voir dire. \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nM.’s Trial Evidence \\n[16] \\n \\nM. testified that her mother and father would hit her with a wooden spoon on her \\nbum. Both of them did it. It occurred more than once. She also testified that once when she was \\nriding her bicycle her father pushed her against the car in the driveway. \\n[17] \\n \\nM. gave no evidence about sexual misconduct involving herself or any of her \\nsiblings. \\nG.’s Trial Evidence \\n[18] \\n \\nG. testified about her sister being pushed by their father on the day of his arrest. \\n[19] \\n \\nShe testified that her father made her put her mouth on his penis. \\n[20] \\n \\nShe testified about being in the bathtub with her mother and father and a water \\nbottle being squirted. \\n[21] \\n \\nShe testified about her father and mother putting a fork into her vagina and bum. \\nThey were all naked in the bathtub.  \\n[22] \\n \\nOn one occasion, her father picked her up from school and put her to the ground \\nand stepped on her with both of his feet. \\n[23] \\n \\nShe described that her parents took pictures and videos of her touching various parts \\nof her body. They used a spoon on her toes. She was naked. They had clothes on. They used the \\nflashlight and a bendy chopstick in doing this. \\n[24] \\n \\nShe testified that on one occasion, her father pulled her off of the top bunk of a \\nbunkbed. \\n[25] \\n \\nShe also testified that if she had an accident, meaning wetting herself, they would \\npull down her pants and whack her with a wooden spoon. \\n[26] \\n \\nShe testified that she did not talk to any of her siblings about these sexual things. \\nB.’s Trial Evidence \\n[27] \\n \\nB. was born July 21, 2008. He is an older brother of M. and G. \\n[28] \\n \\nHe described the family household as violent. \\n[29] \\n \\nHe described what happened on the day of his father’s arrest. His father punched \\nhim from behind on the back of his head and also grabbed his sister and shoved her into the van. \\nHe also kicked his sister. \\n[30] \\n \\nHe described his father spilling water on his sister. \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\n[31] \\n \\nHe stated that his father hurt all of them every day although not necessarily the \\nsame people. \\n[32] \\n \\nHe described being grabbed by his shirt or his neck and put up against the wall. \\n[33] \\n \\nHe described his father kicking M. almost every day. \\n[34] \\n \\nHe saw his father punch her in her head. \\n[35] \\n \\nHis brother C. would get hit with shovels and rakes. \\n[36] \\n \\nHis father punched him a lot. \\n[37] \\n \\nHis father threw a tape measure at him, leaving a bruise on his chest. C. was also \\nhit in the head by a tape measure. \\n[38] \\n \\nHe described his father pouring water on him and on his sister and throwing buckets \\nat the other children. \\n[39] \\n \\nHe testified that his father threatened to kill all of the children and said he did not \\ncare if he went to jail. \\n[40] \\n \\nHe described that his father slammed the door on his sister H.’s head. \\n[41] \\n \\nHe testified that his brother C., sister K., and he got hurt the most. They were the \\ntargets. \\n[42] \\n \\nHe testified that the children stole food from the pantry. \\n[43] \\n \\nHe testified that he had no knowledge about any sexual misconduct occurring to \\nhim or to his siblings. \\n[44] \\n \\nHe testified that his mother was never physical with the children. \\nThe Issue on the Voir Dire \\n[45] \\n \\nThis evidentiary issue arose in the course of the examination in chief of Crown \\nwitness S.O. She is the sister of the accused M.O. He is six years younger than she is. Prior to the \\ncharges, she had an off and on relationship with him.  \\nS.O.’s Observations of the Children While They Were Living with Their Parents – Not In Issue \\n[46] \\n \\nS.O. testified that the children M. and G. were “very well behaved”, “always very \\nquiet”, “even when we were in a church setting”. She testified that they were “very, very well \\nbehaved”. She testified that they were “almost … hyper-aware, or hyper-sensitive.” She noted that \\nat meals the children would always eat more than her children did. “Other than that, things were \\n… okay”. \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n[47] \\n \\nAs stated, M. and G. came to live with her family of six on May 1, 2020, after \\nhaving lived with the families of two other aunts. L. and H. lived in her household from March to \\nSeptember 2020. \\nThe Observations in Issue: S.O.’s Observations After the Children Came to Live in her \\nHousehold \\n[48] \\n \\nS.O. testified that at first, she did not see anything unusual. She described it as a \\n“‘honeymoon’ period”. \\n[49] \\n \\nThe observations that she describes in her testimony and that are in issue were made \\nby her of M. commencing in the summer of 2020, and of G. commencing in the summer and fall \\nof 2020. \\nObservations of M. \\n[50] \\n \\nS.O. described the observations that she made of M. as including the following: she \\ndid not sleep well, would go through people’s things, had no established boundaries, would get up \\nin the middle of the night to go find food and would take things that did not belong to her. S.O. \\nsaid that M. was very aggressive, threw the cat down the stairs, pushed people downstairs, kicked \\nthe dog, and punched a child in the mouth. S.O. described observing M. to be hyperaware, \\nobsessive about not being dirty, and hypervigilant, and said that sucked her thumb when she came \\ninto S.O.’s care. She said that she saw M. demonstrate sexualized behaviour: pulling her pants \\ndown in front of others, touching other children, and touching people’s breasts. She also observed \\nM. lock the cat in the laundry hamper. M. was verbally explosive with harsh and hurtful words, \\nwould go “from 0 to 60” in a moment, and collected things such as sticks, stones and glass, and \\nhoarded these items in her school locker. She testified that at first M. could not get enough food. \\nShe testified that she observed M. straddling G., G. on top of M., M. masturbating herself roughly, \\nand kissing her younger brother B.E. with her tongue. She said she relegated M. and G. to separate \\nbedrooms as a result of observing the sexual behaviour. \\nObservations of G. \\n[51] \\n \\nS.O. observed that, similar to M., G. did not sleep well, would go through people’s \\nthings, showed no established boundaries, would get up in the middle of the night to go find food, \\nand would take things that did not belong to her. She also described that G. had trouble with her \\ntoileting, both urinating and defecating in her pants. She testified that G. had frequent “urinary \\ntract infections”, to the point she became resistant to medication. She testified that G. “was \\ndiagnosed with … neurogenic bladder dysfunction, that they said was caused from her prior \\ntrauma”. She stated that G. would have frequent accidents, resulting in “really strong smells”. She \\ntestified that G. required catheters “because her bladder was so irritated”. She would catheterize \\nG. every three hours, five times a day. She testified that G. required medications to help relieve \\nbladder spasms. She described G. as also hoarding food. G. would self-harm by picking at herself, \\nespecially when asked to take phone calls from her parents. She testified that G. gravitates towards \\nyounger children. She testified that G. steals things in stores, especially food. She testified that G. \\nstill cannot get enough food. \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nObservations of L. and H. \\n[52] \\n \\nL. and H. lived in S.O.’s household from March to September 2020. \\n[53] \\n \\nS.O. described these children wetting their beds, having poor hygiene, being \\nhungry, looking for food, and looking over their shoulders. She testified that L. watched \\ninappropriate things on her tablet and would have panic attacks in the shower. \\nM. and G.’s Statements to Police \\n[54] \\n \\nM. and G. gave statements to the police in 2019 and 2020 alleging physical abuse \\nby their parents, but made no allegations of sexual abuse. \\n[55] \\n \\nM. and G. disclosed the alleged sexual misconduct by their parents to S.O. at some \\npoint after the observations described above were made. The only date of disclosure specified in \\nS.O.’s evidence is that M. disclosed to her in June 2021. From an earlier application, it is known \\nthat G. gave her third statement to the police in January 2021, at which time she first made \\nallegations of sexual abuse. M. made a third statement to police in July 2021, in which she alleged \\nsexual abuse. That statement was ruled inadmissible in a 715.1 application. \\nPositions of the Parties \\nCrown Submissions \\n[56] \\n \\nThe Crown submissions followed those set out in her factum. \\n[57] \\n \\nWhen the issue first arose in these proceedings, the Crown stated that S.O. was \\ncalled to give evidence about the observations that she made of the children “in the immediate \\naftermath of the children being removed from the home”. \\n[58] \\n \\nShe submitted that she was not relying on the testimony of S.O. as to what caused \\nthe behaviour of the children, referring to, for example, S.O.’s comment that the bladder \\ndysfunction was caused by the prior trauma. \\n[59] \\n \\nShe submitted that the evidence of S.O.’s observations of the children’s behaviour \\nis admissible from a lay witness in that such evidence is not being tendered by way of expert \\nevidence. The Crown will not be calling any expert evidence with respect to S.O.’s observations. \\n[60] \\n \\nThe Crown relies on the decision in R. v. R.A.N., 2001 ABCA 68, 152 C.C.C. (3d) \\n464, which she says is directly on point with the present case. She notes in her submissions that \\nR.A.N. deals with “observations of [a complainant’s] behavioural changes” when in the presence \\nof the accused. She argued that that case is similar to the present case insofar as G. would self-\\nharm or pick at her skin, and this behaviour became much more prominent when she was asked to \\ntake phone calls with her parents. I note that this is the only observation S.O. linked to the parents. \\n[61] \\n \\nThe Crown also relies on the decision in R. v. R.O., 2015 ONCA 814, 333 C.C.C. \\n(3d) 367, because the Court of Appeal cites R.A.N. \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\n[62] \\n \\nThe Crown submits that the issue on this voir dire is admissibility and does not \\ninvolve weighing of the evidence. \\n[63] \\n \\nThe Crown submits that this evidence of observations made by S.O. is admissible \\nand can be used by the court to make common sense and human experience inferences when \\nassessing the testimony of the complainants as to credibility and reliability. The Crown lumps \\ntogether all of the observations that S.O. made of each of the children. \\n[64] \\n \\nThe Crown also submits that the evidence is admissible as part of the narrative to \\nprovide the requisite context needed to assess the credibility and reliability of the witnesses. \\nDefence Submissions \\n[65] \\n \\nThe defence strongly opposes the admissibility of this evidence. \\n[66] \\n \\nFirst, the hearsay component of some of S.O.’s testimony is obvious, as to the \\ndiagnoses, medical condition of G., the cause thereof, and the reasons for the medication \\nprescribed. \\n[67] \\n \\nThe defence submits that the various observations cannot be lumped together, but \\nneed to be viewed individually and separately in order to assess admissibility, and must be relevant \\nand related to the charges before the court. \\n[68] \\n \\nThe defence also strongly submits that the cases relied upon by the Crown are not \\ndirectly on point but are clearly distinguishable, insofar as the observations in issue on this voir \\ndire were made at least eight months after the children had been removed from the mother’s care, \\nat least ten months after the arrest of the father, and considerably after the time the abuse is alleged \\nto have occurred on the evidence of G. The point is that the observations were not made while the \\nchildren were in the presence of the accused. The point is that the behaviour of the children did \\nnot occur while they were in the presence of the accused and is not in any way linked to the \\naccused, except for the observation of G. picking at her skin being linked to the phone calls. \\n[69] \\n \\nThe defence submits that while the Crown is asking the court to draw inferences \\nbased on common sense and human experience, it does not articulate what those inferences are or \\nshould be. The defence submits that it is clear that the Crown is asking the court to rely on the \\nevidence of the observations to bolster the credibility of the witnesses as to what they say occurred. \\n[70] \\n \\nThe defence points to para. 7 of the Crown factum, where it states the following:  \\nThe Crown does not assert that the guardians are able to testify to a \\ncausative link between the behaviour, for example, that the \\nsexualized behaviours of the children are proof of the offence on \\ntheir own, merely that they observed these behaviours. It is then \\navailable for this Honourable Court to draw inferences from this \\nevidence that the behavioural changes are confirmatory of the \\nchildren’s accounts.  \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nThe defence points out that these observations were made after the children had been removed \\nfrom the family home with the involvement of the police and the Children’s Aid Society. At the \\nrelevant time, they were in the latest of a number of homes that they had been put in within a year. \\nThey have been housed with people whom they had not previously seen very often. The children \\nhave been split up as a family unit. This distinguishes the cases relied on by the Crown. \\n[71] \\n \\nIt is to be noted that, in its factum, the Crown refers to the evidence in R.A.N. as \\n“behavioural changes” in the complainant when in the presence of the accused. That is not the \\npresent fact scenario. \\n[72] \\n \\nThe defence notes that in the cases relied upon by the Crown, the evidence of the \\nobservations of the behaviour of the complainant was called to rebut the defence argument. \\n[73] \\n \\nThe defence also notes that during the course of their testimony at trial, M. and G. \\nwere not asked about the behaviours S.O. testified to. \\n[74] \\n \\nThe defence notes that the Court of Appeal noted in R.O., at para. 40, that “[t]he \\nCrown did not argue that the complainant’s behaviour confirmed the abuse.” In contrast, in the \\npresent case, the Crown will be asking this court to draw inferences from the observations \\nconfirming the abuse. \\n[75] \\n \\nThe defence strongly questions whether the observations in issue in this case can \\ngive rise to such inferences as sought by the Crown on the basis of common sense and human \\nexperience. \\n[76] \\n \\nThe defence suggests that many of the observations sought to be tendered as \\nadmissible could be indicative of poor parenting, and therefore evidence of bad character. The \\ncharacter of the accused has not been put into issue. \\n[77] \\n \\nWith respect to the Crown position that the evidence is admissible as part of the \\nnarrative, the defence has referred to Justice David M. Paciocco & Lee Stuesser, The Law of \\nEvidence, 7th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2015), at pp. 46-47. In reference to the Crown factum, at \\npara. 19, the defence points out that none of the purposes identified by the Crown for evidence of \\nnarrative are relevant to this case. \\n[78] \\n \\nThe defence points out that at para. 20 of the Crown factum, the Crown specifies \\nthat it intends to ask the court to use the observations in issue to assess witness credibility. The \\ndefence strongly asserts that the observations have no relevance in that regard as matters of \\ncommon sense and human experience. \\nReply \\n[79] \\n \\nThe Crown reply submissions include reference to para. 75 of R. v. Kruk, 2024 SCC \\n7, which provides as follows: \\nTrial judges are uniquely tasked with assessing the testimony they \\nhear and interpreting the range of possible inferences arising from \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nthe evidence. They must be able to rely not only on their judicial \\nexperience as fact-finders, but also on their common sense and the \\ngeneralized expectations it generates about human behaviour. Trial \\njudges will naturally rely on “ungrounded” assumptions about \\nhuman behaviour in their testimonial assessments and thereby draw \\non factors that lie outside the immediate record. The Judicial \\nfunction entitles them to do so without requiring extrinsic evidence \\nto support each and every one of their conclusions. \\nAnalysis \\nThe Hearsay Opinion/Expert Evidence \\n[80] \\n \\nThe following evidence of S.O. is expert evidence that was told to S.O. by a medical \\nprofessional and as such is clearly inadmissible hearsay: \\n1. G. had frequent urinary tract infections – so many that she became resistant to \\nmedication and they ended up having to use compounded medications; \\n2. G. was diagnosed with neurogenic bladder dysfunction that they said was caused \\nby her prior trauma; \\n3. G. needed catheters to empty her bladder because her bladder was so irritated; and \\n4. G. was on medications to help with bladder spasms. \\nThe R.A.N. and R.O. Cases are Substantively Distinguishable \\n[81] \\n \\nR.A.N. addressed observed behavioural changes in the complainant during the \\ntimeframe when the alleged abuse was occurring and whenever the appellant was around. The \\nbehavioural changes stopped when the accused moved away and had no contact with the \\ncomplainant: at para. 2. \\n[82] \\n \\nIn that case, there was a temporal nexus between the abuse occurring, the accused \\nbeing present, and the behavioural changes. \\n[83] \\n \\nThe Crown also referred me to three cases cited at para. 20 of R.A.N. \\n[84] \\n \\nThese cases also dealt with a close temporal nexus between the observed \\nbehavioural changes and the abuse. \\n[85] \\n \\nIn R. v. V. (G.R.) (1996), 76 B.C.A.C. 72 (B.C. C.A.), the behavioural changes \\noccurred during the period of the alleged abuse: paras 6, 10. The court pointed out, at para. 15, that \\nin contrast to the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Fair, which I cite below, “In the case \\nat bar the evidence was much more specific and was time - connected to the alleged assaults”. The \\ncourt noted, at para. 16, that that case was distinguishable from the other authorities cited and that \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nthe evidence was admissible “as part of the family dynamics in which the alleged offences \\noccurred”. \\n[86] \\n \\nIn R. v. Munroe (1994), 51 B.C.A.C. 174 (B.C. C.A.), the evidence in question was \\nof the mother’s observations that the complainant’s personality changed for the worse after the \\nnight in question. The court held that the complainant’s story was strengthened by the serious \\nreaction she suffered following the alleged incident, as observed by her mother. In that case, the \\nobservations were made apparently immediately after the incident and the complainant’s \\nnightmares were of a continuing nature thereafter. The observational evidence was directly linked \\nto the alleged incident. \\n[87] \\n \\nIn R. v. Falkenberg (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 307 (Alta. C.A.), the evidence was of a \\nfriend and a relative as to the appearance and behaviour of the complainant after the event. She \\nwas observed to be curled up, unresponsive, not communicating, in a world of her own. The court \\nstated that the witnesses meant to describe that the complainant’s apparent state of mind had been \\n“similar to that of people who have just had very bad news or a severe fright” (emphasis added): \\nat p. 309. Clearly, the observations were contemporaneous with the alleged sexual assault. \\n[88] \\n \\nIn R.O., it appears that behaviours were observed while the abuse was ongoing and \\nthe complainant lived with the accused. The Crown called the evidence to respond to the defence \\nposition arguing that the complainant’s problems were consistent with the timing of the abuse. \\nSignificantly, and in contrast to the present case, “[t]he Crown did not argue that the complainant’s \\nbehaviour confirmed the abuse. There was very little evidence led on this point. The Crown \\nquestioned the complainant about her bad behaviour, including skipping school and drinking, as \\nwell as the timeline of the alleged abuse”: at para. 40. The Crown put to the accused that the \\ncomplainant’s problems at school increased as the sexual abuse escalated. \\n[89] \\n \\nIn contrast to R.O., in the present case, the Crown is urging that this court rely on \\nS.O.’s observations to draw inferences supporting the child complainants’ allegations of abuse. I \\nobserve that there is, to this point, no evidence or allegations of sexual abuse in regard to M. As \\nsuch, it appears the Crown seeks to have the court draw inferences inconsistent with the evidence. \\n[90] \\n \\nThose cases dealt with observations of behavioural changes in the complainant \\nduring the timeframe of the abuse, in the presence of the accused, or shortly after the alleged event, \\nand in the one case were of a continuing nature. \\n[91] \\n \\nThat is not the situation in the present case. \\n[92] \\n \\nThe abuse alleged by G. occurred months earlier than S.O.’s observations. \\n[93] \\n \\nThe children in the present case were not questioned at trial about S.O.’s \\nobservations of their behaviours. \\n[94] \\n \\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal has addressed the situation most similar to the present \\ncase in R. v. Fair (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), cited in R.A.N., at para. 21. In my view, the \\ndecision in Fair is binding and determinative of the issue on this voir dire. In that case, the \\ncomplainant testified as to a series of sexual assaults by the accused in 1985, 1986, and 1987, \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\ncommencing when she was nine years of age. At the time, she was living with her mother and the \\naccused. \\n[95] \\n \\nThe observations of the complainant’s emotional state and the timing of those \\nobservations are set out at pp. 6-7 of the decision: \\nThe evidence of the complainant's emotional state during the period \\nof the alleged assaults came mainly from the testimony of the \\ncomplainant’s aunt and the complainant’s mother. The aunt testified \\nto four specific instances in which she recalled the complainant’s \\nemotional state had been abnormal. \\n(a) During a visit around Christmas 1986 to the appellant’s \\nhome, in which the complainant and her mother were living, \\nthe complainant appeared very nervous, withdrawn and \\ntimid, and would follow her around and “cling” to her. \\n(b) In May 1988 while the complainant visited her aunt in \\nLondon, Ontario she, her aunt, and her aunt’s fiancee drove \\nto a video store to rent a movie. The complainant got out of \\nthe car in a daze, walked to the end of the strip mall, and sat \\ndown on the curb and started to rock and cry. She was \\nspeaking in a very low tone of voice and became more and \\nmore upset to the point of becoming hysterical. This lasted \\nfor about 45 minutes. \\n(c) In November of 1989, the complainant called her aunt \\nfrom Hamilton to see if she could come to London for a visit. \\nShe appeared upset over the phone and wished to take the \\nbus leaving in 20 minutes. The aunt picked the complainant \\nup at the bus station, and the complainant seemed very quiet, \\ndistraught and withdrawn. \\n(d) Approximately a week and a half after the last visit, the \\naunt received a call from the complainant from the London \\nbus station. When the aunt picked her up from the station, \\nthe complainant was standing in the middle of the sidewalk \\nwith her head down and crying. She was very despondent \\nand would not talk for hours. During the visits to London, \\nthe complainant would work all through the night cleaning \\nand would rarely get to sleep before 4:00 or 5:00 in the \\nmorning. She would sleep late into the day, get up \\ndespondent and depressed, and the same cycle would begin \\nagain. \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nThe complainant’s mother also testified as to the complainant’s \\nemotional state during the relevant period. She testified that the \\ncomplainant, who used to be very outgoing, became withdrawn and \\nintroverted and had no self-esteem. She also testified that after she \\nand the complainant moved out of the appellant’s home, she noticed \\nthat the complainant’s sleeping habits had changed, and that she had \\nproblems sleeping so that she would sometimes sit awake until 3:00 \\nor 4:00 in the morning. \\nThe complainant’s father gave evidence as to the emotional state of \\nthe complainant both before and after the disclosure to Szaba of the \\nassaults. He testified that, during the complainant’s stay in \\nSaskatchewan in 1988 “she seemed to be showing signs of not \\ndealing with things well. She was despondent; she was depressed. \\nEmotionally she seemed as if she was having a good deal of \\ndifficulty but couldn’t come to terms with it”. He also testified that \\nafter the complainant had disclosed the assaults to the social worker \\nin December of 1990 the complainant became a totally different \\nperson, was depressed and was having difficulty dealing with the \\nsituation to the point of not being able to complete her last three \\nweeks of grade nine and dropping out of school the next year. \\n[96] \\n \\nIt is only the first observation made by the aunt and the first observations described \\nby the mother that are contemporaneous with the abuse. \\n[97] \\n \\nOn this point, the court stated the following, at pp. 21-23: \\nMy first observation about the four episodes of apparent emotional \\nupset is that there is nothing in the episodes to connect them with \\nthe sexual assaults.  \\n. . . \\nThe trial judge ruled that the complainant’s emotional state was \\nrelevant because it showed the effect on the complainant of the \\nsexual assault. The complainant did not so testify nor did anyone \\nelse. There is no nexus between the sexual assaults and the mood \\nchanges described in the evidence. How many of these mood \\nchanges are natural in the childhood of any young person and how \\nmany are attributable to a child trapped in a relationship between her \\nmother and a man she simply did not like, is left to the conjecture of \\nthe jury. I think they deserved more help. I think that it was \\nincumbent upon the Crown to lead an expert witness who would be \\nin a position to relate the emotional trauma, if such it was, to the \\nsexual assaults alleged. Left the way it was, it was of no probative \\nvalue and was highly prejudicial to the appellant. \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\nOnce again, there was no direction from the trial judge as to what \\nuse the jury could make of this evidence despite the closing \\nargument of the Crown in which he declaimed at length the \\nemotional condition of the complainant as seen through the eyes of \\nher family. He relied strongly on the evidence of the aunt.  \\n. . . \\nOn appeal, Crown counsel submitted that evidence of physical \\ninjury and hysteria have always been admissible in rape cases, and \\nthat emotional upset is in the same category. I think this ignores the \\nfact that the hysteria in the cases he referred to was always \\ncontemporaneous with the rape or other sexual assault. It was \\nintroduced as corroborative of the truth of the complainant’s claim \\nthat she was raped or sexually assaulted. For example, in the case \\nunder appeal, the fact of the bruising to the complainant’s eye was \\nadmissible because the complainant related it to the slap of the \\nappellant which overcame her resistance to the sexual assault. \\nAbsent such a nexus, the mere fact that a child had an unexplained \\nbruise would not be admissible. \\nIn R. v. B. (G.) (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 200 [77 C.R. (3d) 347] \\n(S.C.C.), Wilson J. stated that evidence of an expert as to the \\npsychological and physical conditions which frequently arise as the \\nresult of sexual abuse is admissible to provide assistance to the trier \\nof fact as to whether an assault has occurred (p. 220 [C.C.C., p. 369 \\nC.R.]). In my opinion such evidence is not only admissible, but in a \\ncase like the one under appeal, it is mandatory if the Crown intends \\nto rely upon lay descriptions of the complainant’s emotional \\ncondition as direct evidence that she was subject to a sexual assault. \\nWithout such evidence, there is nothing to connect the emotional \\ncondition described to the offence charged as opposed to some other \\nunhappiness experienced by the complainant. There is nothing to \\ndemonstrate that these four unrelated episodes and the ex post facto \\nrecollections of the parents of the child as to her general lassitude \\nand sleeplessness are even manifestations of a child with serious \\nemotional problems. Certainly, nobody at the time thought enough \\nof the symptoms to consider helping her. The complainant instituted \\nher own therapy through a counsellor at school in Saskatchewan. \\n[98] \\n \\nI have also considered R. v. S.(C.N.), 1990 CarswellBC 838 (B.C. C.A.), R. v. Z.L., \\n2000 BCCA 169, 144 C.C.C. (3d) 444, aff’d 2001 SCC 16, and R. v. A.R.D., 2017 ABCA 237, 55 \\nAlta. L.R. (6th) 213, aff’d 2018 SCC 6. \\n[99] \\n \\nOn this authority, S.O.’s evidence as to the behaviours of M., G., L., and H. as a \\nsource for the court to assess and confirm the credibility and reliability of the evidence of G. – and \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\nperhaps L. and H., depending on their testimony – as to the allegations of sexual abuse is \\ninadmissible in the absence of admissible expert evidence. \\n[100]  \\nIn reaching this decision, I have considered the principles set out in R. v. D.D., 2000 \\nSCC 43, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275, and R. v. Kiss, 2018 ONCA 184, as to delayed disclosure and how \\nvictims do and do not react to sexual abuse, and in R. v. D.P., 2017 ONCA 263, as to piecemeal \\ndisclosure. \\nNarrative \\n[101]  \\nWith respect to the Crown submission that the evidence is admissible as part of the \\nnarrative, the decision in Fair, at pp. 16, 20-21, is also instructive: \\nIt must be a part of the narrative in the sense that it advances the \\nstory from offence to prosecution or explains why so little was done \\nto terminate the abuse or bring the perpetrator to justice. \\nSpecifically, it appears to me to be part of the narrative of a \\ncomplainant’s testimony when she recounts the assaults, how they \\ncame to be terminated, and how the matter came to the attention of \\nthe police. \\n… \\nTo qualify as narrative, the witness must recount relevant and \\nessential facts which describe and explain his or her experience as a \\nvictim of the crime alleged so that the trier of fact will be in a \\nposition to understand what happened and how the matter came to \\nthe attention of the proper authorities. … The fact that the statements \\nwere made is admissible to assist the jury as to the sequence of \\nevents from the alleged offence to the prosecution so that they can \\nunderstand the conduct of the complainant and assess her \\ntruthfulness. However, the jury must be instructed that they are not \\nto look to the content of the statements as proof that a crime has been \\ncommitted. \\n[102]  \\nS.O.’s observations of the children’s behaviour do not meet this criteria. Nor do \\nthey meet the purposes of narrative evidence as set out in the factum of the Crown, at para. 19. \\n[103]  \\nFurthermore, the following cases are instructive. In R. v. Edwards, 2009 \\nCarswellOnt 5246 (S.C.), the court writes the following at paras. 22-24: \\nNarrative has been described by Paciaocco and Stuesser in The Law \\nof Evidence: 5th Edition … page 45, as “harmless background \\nmaterial” that, while frequently not meeting the admissibility \\nprerequisites of relevance and materiality, is often tolerated \\n“because it improves comprehension by presenting a total picture \\nand makes it easier for the witness to recount the evidence”. \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nAt times, however, narrative can contain highly prejudicial \\ninformation. As Paciaocco and Stuesser point out, where narrative \\nconstitutes prejudicial information, it should only be allowed \\n“where significant testimony can not be recounted meaningfully and \\nfairly without its disclosure.” \\nNarrative, in my view, is really akin to connective tissue. It binds \\ntogether other elements of significant and admissible testimony and \\nmakes that evidence more comprehensible. I do not agree that \\nnarrative, on its own, could ever really be described as a “live issue” \\nin a case. \\nIn that case, narrative evidence related to prior disreputable conduct was not necessary to recount \\n“the evidence relating directly to the charged incidents … meaningfully and fairly”: at para. 25. \\nIn R. v. Proulx, 2022 ONSC 1495, the court writes the following at para. 92: “Narrative evidence \\nis evidence which helps the judge or jury to understand how the charges came to be before the \\ncourt”. \\n[104]  \\nIn my view, the evidence at issue does not seem to fit into any of the permitted uses \\nof narrative evidence. The observation evidence of S.O. is not admissible on this basis either. \\nConclusion \\n[105]  \\nFor these reasons, the evidence of the observations of the children testified to by \\nS.O. are not admissible for the purposes sought by the Crown. \\n \\n \\n \\nTranmer J. \\n \\nReleased: March 27, 2024 \\n2024 ONSC 1777 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\nCITATION: R. v.

R.S.   \\nBEFORE: \\nS.F. Dunphy J. \\nCOUNSEL: Sujung Lee and Andrew Bigioni, for the Defendant Applicant  \\n \\nKelly Simpson, for the Crown Respondent \\nHEARD at Toronto: \\nMarch 21, 2024 \\n \\nREASONS FOR DECISION – Application for Adjournment \\nSubject to Publication Ban pursuant to s. 486.4 of the Criminal Code \\nPursuant to section 486.4 of the Criminal Code an order has been made in these proceedings directing that any \\ninformation that could identify the victim shall not be published in any document or broadcast or transmitted in any \\nway.  These Reasons for Decision have been anonymized to omit any reference to the name or other identifying \\ncharacteristics of the victim and may be published in any digest or compilation of decisions of the court. \\n \\n[1] \\nOn March 22, 2024, I dismissed a motion to adjourn this trial in order to permit a \\nthird-party records application under s. 278.3 of the Criminal Code.  In so doing, I \\nindicated my written reasons would follow.  These are those reasons.   \\n[2] \\nAn application for the adjournment of a trial in these circumstances requires the \\nassessment and balancing of a number of interests broadly captured by the phrase “the \\ninterests of justice”.  Among the interests to be considered are: \\na. the right to full answer and defence of course and any prejudice to that right \\nif the adjournment were not granted; \\nb. the stated reason for the adjournment and the likelihood of that purpose \\nbeing served by the adjournment requested;  \\nc. the impact on the proceedings and the public interest in a trial on the merits; \\nd. the interest of the public and of the accused in the completion of this and \\nother trials within a reasonable time; and \\n2024 ONSC 1806 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\ne. the likely duration of the delay.   \\n[3] \\nThere is no section 278.3 application before me at this point.  This is an application \\nfor an adjournment to pursue such an application.  There are numerous hurdles to be \\ncleared before such an application could be heard.  The procedure described in s. \\n278.3(5) must be complied with or, where applicable, orders must be sought and obtained \\nto alter or waive strict compliance with them.  Among other yet uncrossed hurdles is (i) \\nactually identifying with precision the records sought and (ii) obtaining the names of the \\nrecord-keepers.  These can be described relatively generically from the information \\navailable at present but the necessary information of names and addresses of potential \\nrecord holders, the dates of their involvement etc. have not been gathered at this point.  I \\ncannot presume that the complainant will cooperate at all in any further procedures \\ninvolving this case, still less in a request for personal information, the disclosure of which \\nwould likely lead to her recall as a witness given her state of emotional exhaustion after \\n2.5 days of cross-examination.  I indicated to the parties that I would entertain the \\nadjournment application at this juncture recognizing that there are hurdles such as these \\nto be crossed in proceeding with the intended application.  If granted, the adjournment \\nwould of course be subject to completing those additional tasks required to bring an \\napplication as stipulated in s. 278.3(5) and a timetable for doing so would have to be \\nprepared and adhered to.   \\n[4] \\nTo consider this application and the grounds for it, I am necessarily compelled to \\nexamine the complainant’s evidence.  She is the sole witness called by the Crown who \\nrested its case after her testimony.  The only evidence available for the intended \\napplication is the complainant’s evidence at trial and any evidence assembled prior to \\ntrial.  The defence candidly admitted that the state of the evidence prior to trial was wholly \\ninadequate to sustain a credible s. 278.3 application.  While it is clearly far too early in the \\ntrial to start to venture opinions on the credibility or reliability of the complainant’s \\nevidence, the fact remains that it is the only additional evidence relevant to the proposed \\napplication that has been added to the insufficient state of the record that existed before \\nthe trial.  If I am to assess whether the interests of justice can be invoked to suspend this \\ntrial in mid-stream, I must draw at least some factual conclusions from her evidence, \\nwhich evidence has been subjected to very detailed cross-examination with this very \\napplication in mind, and for the purposes of this application only.   \\n[5] \\nThe possibility of this application was of course in the air throughout the various \\njudicial pre-trials that preceded trial and during the cross-examination of the complainant \\nas well.  The defence concluded that the evidentiary record as it existed prior to the trial \\nwas insufficient to warrant a s. 278.3 application.  The possibility that additional evidence \\nmight surface at trial warranting a re-examination of the issue was addressed by all of the \\nparties during their various pre-trial appearances, but no agreement was reached beyond \\nleaving it to the trial judge to assess at the relevant time.  The defence completed its \\ncross-examination without prejudice to resuming it following a successful s. 278.3 \\napplication after which the Crown closed its case.   \\n2024 ONSC 1806 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[6] \\nWhat then was the state of the evidentiary record before the start of trial that was \\njudged to be inadequate to warrant proceeding with the application in the time frame \\ncontemplated by s. 278.3(5)?   \\n[7] \\nThe only relevant pre-trial evidence to which I have been directed is the statement \\nof the complainant to police given in February 2022 about events that she said occurred \\nalmost 40 years earlier between 1985 and 1987.  In the course of that statement, the \\ncomplainant outlined what she could remember of the details of certain instances of \\nabuse she allegedly suffered as a 10 – 12 year old girl at the hands of the accused who \\nwas then a friend of her parents.  She mentioned that she had been in hospital “for this” \\nand seen psychiatrists and psychologists “that I’m still seeing right now”.   The inference \\nthat “this” was in reference to the abuse she said she suffered at the hands of the \\ndefendant and outlined in her statement is unavoidable in the context.  She also indicated \\nthat she had told her husband before her wedding “that this happened” but “didn’t give \\nhim any details” and “would talk to [him] about it when I’m ready to”.  She also mentioned \\nhaving told an aunt about it when in hospital.   \\n[8] \\nThere was thus evidence that the subject-matter of her alleged abuse had been \\ndiscussed (i) with psychiatrists and psychologists; (ii) with her husband prior to their \\nwedding; and (ii) with an aunt.  The last of these was hearsay evidence – the complainant \\ndid not recall that she had spoken to the aunt about this subject but was reminded that \\nshe had by her father.   The names of the relevant professionals were not mentioned by \\nthe complainant but the fact that they would likely have some records of their interactions \\nwith the complainant requires no great degree of speculation.  There is no suggestion \\nthat the husband or the aunt made any records that could be the object of an application.   \\n[9] \\nThe defence therefore had evidence that the complainant had been discussing \\n“this” which in the context is the allegations of abuse referenced in her statement with \\nmental health professionals since the time of her hospitalization related to or arising from \\nthe same cause.  There was also evidence and that she had earlier mentioned the \\nexistence of abuse to her husband prior to her wedding but told him few details and didn’t \\nfeel ready at that time to reveal more. \\n[10] \\nThis was the state of the record that the defence judged inadequate to warrant \\ncommencing a s. 278.3 application more than 60 days in advance in order comply with s. \\n278.3(5) of the Criminal Code.  How has the situation changed since the complainant \\nprovided her evidence in chief and was cross-examined over 2.5 days?   \\n[11] \\nIn my view, the additional evidence obtained after such lengthy cross-examination \\nhas not moved the ball any further down the field than it was before the trial began.   The \\ncomplainant has filled in some time parameters:  the hospitalization referenced appears \\nto have been in or about 2007.  The discussion with her husband – as bare-bones as the \\nstatement suggests it was – occurred prior to their wedding in 2004.  There was some \\nreference to having discussed the subject of her abuse several years before that when \\n2024 ONSC 1806 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nseeking mental health counselling while in university and living out of town.  In the last \\nmoments of a grueling cross-examination that left her very near the point of mental \\nexhaustion she agreed that she may have “conflated” (a word with which she was not \\nfamiliar) her memory of the colour or type of track suit she said the accused wore on one \\noccasion with her memory of what he wore on another.  That minor confusion itself was \\npresent and frankly admitted to by her in her original police statement.   \\n[12] \\nIn my view, the additional information derived from her cross-examination \\nrepresents a difference in quantity of information relevant to the intended application but \\nnot a material difference in quality.  \\n[13] \\nThe complainant’s evidence viewed fairly and as a whole provided no basis \\nwhatever to support the thesis that her memory of these events has been recovered or \\ninfluenced by her various sessions with mental health professionals and indeed quite \\nforcefully rejected such suggestions.  There is no evidence that has emerged of any \\nmental condition relevant to her capacity to recall or credibility.  While the complainant \\nreferred to having “suppressed” her memory of certain events on several occasions, her \\nevidence in its full context explained what she meant by this phrase.  She consistently \\nmaintained that she always knew of the fact of her abuse and by whom.  The particular \\ninstances of abuse related by her were similarly always known by her.  None of this was \\nforgotten so much as she chose not to bring such memories to the surface as a coping \\nmechanism.  She “suppressed” these memories only in the sense of forcing herself not \\nto think of them due to the fact that the accused was a friend of her parents, later lived \\nacross the street from them and was an integral part of the social circle that her cultural \\nmilieu expected would be participating in family functions over the years.  She felt unable \\nto confront her parents about the abuse but distanced herself from her abuser as far as \\nshe was able in the circumstances.   \\n[14] \\nHer evidence fairly viewed was that therapy has assisted her in coping with these \\nmemories but not in recalling them.  Her evidence at trial provides no additional \\nevidentiary foundation that is specific to this case relevant to the intended application \\nbeyond the facts available before the trial began and was judged to be inadequate to \\nsustain the intended application. \\n[15] \\nThe complainants’ evidence confirms what common sense suggests.  Where the \\nsubject of her childhood abuse has surfaced in the course of therapy sessions with \\nmedical professionals, it has been the fact of the abuse rather than the particular details \\nof individual episodes of abuse which has been the primary subject of discussion.  There \\nis no evidentiary basis to infer that therapists would have examined the complainant on \\nthe details of the events in a fraction of the detail that the complainant has been subjected \\nto in more than 2.5 days of close examination.  The two types of examination – one \\nforensic and the other therapeutic – have entirely different objects.    \\n2024 ONSC 1806 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n[16] \\nIn my view, that conclusion based on my review of the whole of the evidence of \\nthe complainant essentially disposes of this application.   \\n[17] \\nNo additional evidence has emerged to support the thesis of recovered memory or \\ntainted memory – an observation that in no way precludes arguments being directed to \\nthat thesis or generally towards the frailty of memory of events at such a great distance \\nin time at the close of trial.  The only other grounds of potential likely relevance raised by \\nthe defence all fall squarely within the list of grounds listed in s. 278.3(4) that Parliament \\nhas determined are not sufficient on their own to justify production.  There is a high \\nexpectation of privacy attaching to such records and the evidentiary record establishes \\nnothing case-specific to establish the likely relevance of these records to an issue at trial.     \\n[18] \\nThis case has a number of parallels to the case of R. v. P.E., [2000] O.J. No. 574, \\n129 O.A.C. 369 (Ont. C.A.).  In that case, the appellant sought production of records made \\nby an unnamed therapist but at a named clinic.  There as here, the complainant had \\npreviously discussed the matter with her husband and other persons before seeking \\ntherapy and there was no evidence that counselling had influenced her recollection of the \\nevents.  The Court noted (at para. 16) that: \\nAll of the submissions made by the appellant fall within one or the other of these \\ncategories. In Mills at p. 380, the court held that an accused is not prevented from \\nrelying on these assertions \"where there is an evidentiary or informational \\nfoundation to suggest that they may be related to likely relevance\". There is no \\nsuch foundation. As we have pointed out, there was nothing to suggest that the \\ncomplainant had recovered these memories of abuse or that the counselling had \\ninfluenced her memory. The submissions made on the application at trial and on \\nthis appeal amount to nothing more than bare assertions. There is, in the words of \\nthe court in Mills at p. 380, \"no case-specific evidence or information to show that \\nthe record in issue is likely relevant to an issue at trial\". \\n[19] \\nI was asked by the defence to treat historical sexual assault allegations as a \\ncategory apart where the benchmark of likely relevance is different or where the \\ncomplainant’s interests are somehow entitled to less weight in the s. 278.3 process than \\nmight be the case with a non-historical complaint.     \\n[20] \\nThat assertion lacks logic and common sense.  An alleged record of a fresh \\nallegation and a record of an allegation of an older allegation both raise precisely the \\nsame issues of potential relevance and must be balanced in the same way.  Sexual \\nassault complaints seldom involve an eyewitness to the actual assault apart from the \\ncomplainant and the accused and the credibility of the complainant is always a central \\nissue in such cases.  The high expectation of privacy of a complainant that must be \\nbalanced in the s. 278.3 process is not lessened by the age of the allegation.  The clear \\nintent of Parliament as enacted in s. 278.3(4) is that the grounds for disregarding that \\n2024 ONSC 1806 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nexpectation of privacy must go beyond mere speculation on its own but requires \\nadditional, case-specific evidence. \\n[21] \\nThere is always the prospect that another account by the complainant of the events \\ngiving rise to the charge – no matter how detailed or sparse that account –may differ in \\nsome way great or small from the account relayed by the complainant to police or on the \\nwitness stand.  Applying so low a standard of “likely relevance” would strip s. 278.3(4) of \\nany meaning and frustrate the intent of Parliament.   \\n[22] \\nIn R. v. W.B., 2000 CanLII 5751 (ON CA), Doherty J.A. wrote (at para. 71): \\nIf the likely relevance bar is that low, it serves no purpose where the records relate \\nto counselling or treatment connected to allegations of sexual abuse. It is \\nimpossible to imagine that such records would not contain references to the \\nalleged abuse or matters that could affect the credibility of the complainants\\' \\nallegation of abuse. In my view, the mere fact that a complainant has spoken to a \\ncounsellor or doctor about the abuse or matters touching on the abuse does not \\nmake a record of those conversations likely relevant to a fact in issue or to a \\ncomplainant\\'s credibility.   \\n[23] \\nSee as well at para. 77 of W.B., where Doherty J.A. remarked that it “will not, \\nhowever, suffice to demonstrate no more than that the record contained a statement \\nreferable to a subject matter which would be relevant to the complainant\\'s credibility. The \\nmere fact that a witness has said something in the past about a subject matter on which \\nthe witness may properly be cross-examined at trial does not give that prior statement \\nany relevance.”  \\n[24] \\nThe Crown’s burden of proof in an historical allegation is not altered by the age of \\nthe allegation even if the practical impediments to proof to that standard are inexorably \\nmagnified by the passage of time.  The general observation that memories are frail and \\ndegrade with time is a truism and may well contribute to reasonable doubt which it is ever \\nthe Crown’s burden to dispel before a guilty verdict may issue.  This is so whether the \\nelapsed time is six months or forty years.  Nothing in the passage of time diminishes the \\nprivacy expectations of the complainant nor does it render less speculative an evidence-\\nfree fishing expedition into records without more given the directions contained in s. \\n278.3(4).  This is why the courts since Mills1 have required case specific evidence that \\ngoes beyond the mere existence of a potential fishing ground.   \\n[25] \\nAs noted, this is NOT an application under s. 278.3 but is an application for an \\nadjournment to pursue such an application.  The hurdles in front of such an application \\n                                            \\n \\n1 R. v. Mills, 1999 CanLII 637 (SCC), [1999] 3 SCR 668 \\n2024 ONSC 1806 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\nare relevant to this application for an adjournment but not dispositive of it.  Those hurdles \\ninclude the lack of information about the putative record holders and the lack of a clear \\npath to obtain such information from a complainant whose willingness or ability to \\nparticipate further in these proceedings are in considerable doubt.  They also include the \\nlack of any qualitatively new evidence to supplement the evidentiary record that defence \\ncounsel agreed was inadequate to support an application in the manner and time \\ncontemplated by s. 278.3(5).  They include the criteria listed in s. 278.3(4) which by \\nthemselves Parliament has determined are insufficient to ground such an application.   \\n[26] \\nWeighing those hurdles in the balance along with the other criterial required to be \\naddressed in determining where the interests of justice lie, it appears to me that the \\ninterests of justice would not be served by granting the requested adjournment.  The \\napplicant is in essentially the same unsatisfactory position as regards the evidence \\nsupporting the intended application as he was prior to trial.  An adjournment would likely \\nrequire several months to run to ground such threshold issues as the names of record \\nkeepers, the retention of counsel for the complainant and potentially the relevant record \\nkeepers.  The likelihood of success of the application and the likelihood of relevant \\ninformation emerging from it are both entirely speculative.  Meanwhile, the Jordan date \\nfor this trial would inevitably pass by.   \\n[27] \\nThere are systemic and public policy reasons to be cautious about this type of \\napplication as well.  Such concerns needn’t be governing in order to be entitled to some \\nweight in the balancing process, but I must be mindful of not giving a “pass” to \\nadministrative practices that impair the right of full answer and defence because of \\nresource limitations.   \\n[28] \\nThere is no general right of pre-trial discovery in criminal law.  Over time, \\nprocedures have evolved to required Crown disclosure of potentially relevant documents \\nin its possession or control (R. v. Stinchcombe, 1991 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1991] 3 SCR \\n326) and governing the production of documents from third parties not in the Crown’s \\npossession or control (R. v. O\\'Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 SCR 411).  In \\n2019 Parliament chose to restrict the access to a preliminary inquiry which closed a \\nsignificant discovery tool to the defence in sexual assault cases.  This case has thus \\nproceeded to trial without the benefit of a preliminary inquiry.   \\n[29] \\nIt is not the role of a trial judge hearing a mid-trial adjournment application to \\nattempt to replicate that which Parliament has constitutionally chosen to restrict simply \\nbecause the old way of doing things appeared to offer some advantages.  Parliament’s \\npolicy objective in limiting access to a preliminary inquiry was intended to extend a \\nmeasure of protection to victims of sexual violence from the ordeal of being subjected to \\nre-living their trauma through cross-examination on multiple occasions and that policy \\nobjective, while certainly not absolute, should not lightly be interfered with.  Further, the \\nhighly likely consequences of adjourning trials in these circumstances upon the efficient \\nconduct of trials within a reasonable time can easily be surmised and would substantially \\n2024 ONSC 1806 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\ndefeat that objective of Parliament.  Victims of sexual violence frequently seek treatment \\nin the form of therapy and counselling and Parliament has sought to protect and \\nencourage them in doing so,     \\n[30] \\nNone of these factors are absolute.  In R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33 (CanLII), [2019] \\n2 SCR 579 Moldaver J. discussed at some length the delicate balance that Parliament \\nand the courts have sought to achieve over the years between the right of an accused to \\nmake full answer and defence and the social interest in encouraging the reporting of \\nsexual assault offences, eliminating discriminatory or myth-based reasoning from the \\nprocess and fostering an environment that encourages treatment of victims.  These \\ninterests are clearly fundamental social values that need to be balanced and recognized \\nwithout one excluding the other.  \\n[31] \\nWeighing all of these factors in the balance, I have concluded that the interests of \\njustice do not favour interrupting this trial in these circumstances as requested and I \\ndismissed the application.   \\n \\n___________________________ \\nS.F.

The \\ndetermination of the dispute by way of an application under Rule 14.05(3)(d) is not \\nappropriate in this particular case.  The issue of whether the Respondent is required to pay \\nthe Applicant involves several distinct issues. The issue of whether the contract clause is \\nvalid is a separate legal issue from whether the contract clause is enforceable against a \\nparty and whether there are any defences. The relief sought by this Application blends \\nthose distinct issues against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and the issues should \\nbe determined at trial on a fulsome record. There are also material facts in dispute and \\ndiscoveries are required.   \\n2024 ONSC 1823 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\n \\nFacts \\n[4] \\nThe Applicant is a corporation incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) \\non February 20, 1984, with its head office in Kitchener, Ontario. The Applicant is Ontario’s \\nlargest Canadian-owned and Canadian-based publicly held brewery. The Applicant \\nmanufactures and packages alcoholic beverages for its own brands and those of other \\ncompanies. The Respondent is a British Columbia corporation sells and distributes \\nalcoholic beverages across Canada under the brand name “Nude”.  \\n[5] \\nIn 2018 and 2019, the Respondent had discussions with the Applicant to manufacture and \\npackage a line of alcoholic beverages. The Applicant submits that the Respondent \\nrepresented that its production volume had increased and that the Respondent would agree \\nto order a minimum annual volume. The parties negotiated and entered into the Contract \\nManufacturing Agreement dated as of January 1, 2020 (the “Agreement”) before the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic ensued.   \\n[6] \\nSection 4.2 of the Agreement provides a minimum 12-month volume,  \\n4.2 Minimum 12 Month Volume. Nude shall purchase not less than the minimum amount of seventy-five \\nthousand (75,000) hectoliters of the Products (\"Minimum 12 Month Volume\") for each calendar year of the \\nAgreement. Subject to sections 4.3 and 4.4, in the event Nude orders less than the Minimum 12 Month \\nVolume for any period of the term, Nude shall pay to Waterloo upon receipt of an invoice from Waterloo an \\namount equal to the difference between the Minimum 12 Month Volume less the actual twelve (12) month \\npurchased volume of Product multiplied by twenty ($20.00) per hectoliter.  \\n[7] \\nThe Applicant explains that the purpose of the Minimum Purchase Requirement was to \\nprotect the Applicant in circumstances where it had to reserve production capacity at its \\nfacilities for the exclusive purpose of manufacturing the products.  The Applicant submits \\nthat the parties agreed that the Respondent would pay the Applicant any difference between \\nthe minimum annual volume of 75,000 hectoliters and the actual volume it purchased in \\nthe relevant 12-month period multiplied by $20 per hectoliter, which the Applicant refers \\nto as “Take-or-Pay Fees”.  \\n[8] \\nThe term of the Agreement is for 3 years after which the Agreement would continue \\nindefinitely subject to termination on six months written notice. The effective start date of \\nthe Agreement is the date of first production, which occurred on February 25, 2020. \\n[9] \\nThe Applicant argues that from the very beginning of the Agreement, the Respondent \\nconsistently failed to order the minimum annual volume.  The Applicant submits that \\nduring the first three years of the Agreement, the Respondent ordered only nine percent of \\nthe total minimum volume, representing 20,578 hectoliters of the 225,000 hectoliters to \\nwhich it had committed. Accordingly, the Applicant argues that based on section 4.2, the \\nRespondent is required to pay the Applicant the sum of $4,088,440 in fees. The Respondent \\nrefuses to pay these fees. It also refuses to pay outstanding invoices issued by the Applicant \\nin the amount of $64,483.44 plus interest. \\n2024 ONSC 1823 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n[10] \\nThe Respondent argues that on March 18, 2020, the Applicant advised its customers that it \\nmay have to reduce customer order volumes due to anticipated labour and material \\nshortages associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Respondent further argues that on \\nJune 10, 2020, the Applicant advised that it could not accommodate an order from the \\nRespondent until late August and that they would let the Respondent know if anything \\nearlier became available.  The Respondent argues that it repeatedly inquired about \\nscheduling orders during May 2020 to August 21, 2020, but the Applicant responded that \\nit could not produce for the Respondent within the timeframes set out in the Agreement.  \\n[11] \\nOn November 19, and December 7, 2020, the Respondent reduced its 2021 production \\nforecast from 165,000 to 85,000 hectoliters and then to 80,000 hectoliters. The Applicant \\npleads that the reductions amount to approximately $5,000,000 of lost revenues. At the end \\nof May 2021, the Respondent cancelled its entire production for July 2021 and the parties \\nentered into discussions and negotiations about a possible amendment to the Agreement.   \\n[12] \\nThe Respondent did not provide a production forecast for 2022 and the last order issued by \\nthe Respondent was on August 4, 2021.  \\n[13] \\nThe Applicant alleges that the Respondent breached the Agreement because it wanted to \\npay less by placing orders with another brewery. The Applicant alleges that the Respondent \\nbreached its duty of good faith and honest performance to the detriment of the Applicant’s \\ninterests under the Agreement. \\n[14] \\nOn November 11, 2021, the Respondent wrote to the Applicant to advise it would not be \\nable to meet the minimum volumes. On January 25, 2022, the Applicant wrote to the \\nRespondent demanding payment of $4,088,440.00 plus interest pursuant to the Agreement. \\nThe amount of the demand represented the minimum 12-month volume payments for 2020, \\n2021, and 2022.  The Applicant also sought payment of issued invoices.  \\n[15] \\nThe Respondent informed the Applicant that the Agreement was terminated and provided \\nformal written notice of termination on June 28, 2023. The Applicant states that there was \\nno termination right in the first three years of the Agreement. \\n[16] \\nThe Respondent opposes the relief sought on the basis that determination by way of an \\napplication under Rule 14.05(3)(d) is not appropriate and says the Application ought to be \\nconverted to an action. The Respondent argues that the Applicant is asking the court not \\nfor a determination of its rights under the Agreement, but rather an evaluation of the parties’ \\nconduct and the enforceability of a penalty clause. \\nRule 14.05 (3)(d) \\n[17] \\nRule 14.05(3)(d) provides, in part, that a proceeding may be brought by application where \\nthe relief claimed is, the determination of rights that depend on the interpretation of a \\ncontract.  \\n[18] \\nIn Jackson v. Solar Income Fund Inc., 2016 ONCA 908, the Court of Appeal considered \\nRule 14.05(3)(d) at para 6, \\n2024 ONSC 1823 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nRule 14.05(3)(d), which the respondent relies on, authorizes proceeding by way of application where the \\nmatter involves “the determination of rights that depend on the interpretation of a … contract or other \\ninstrument”. This sub-rule is not applicable here. What is at issue is not the interpretation of the \\npromissory note, but the determination of whether the promissory note was modified by a subsequent \\nagreement such that, despite its clear wording, it is not enforceable on demand. This requires an \\nunderstanding of the broader factual matrix, which includes the other agreements that may or may \\nnot conflict with the promissory note. This cannot be determined simply by reading the promissory note in \\nisolation from the larger transaction of which it appears to be a part, or of understanding what the various \\nagreements together were expected to achieve. [Emphasis added.] \\n[19] \\nAs in Jackson v. Solar Income Fund Inc., the interpretation of the Agreement is not at issue \\nin this case but the determination of whether the Agreement was modified by a subsequent \\nagreement between the parties such that, despite its clear wording, the Agreement is not \\nenforceable on demand. This does require an understanding of the broader factual matrix \\nincluding the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\n[20] \\nThe Applicant argues that Jackson v. Solar Income Fund Inc. is distinguishable because \\nthe Agreement was not modified by subsequent agreements or transactions that are part of \\na larger factual matrix. I disagree. It is arguable that the parties faced unexpected events \\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic and those events led to subsequent agreements between \\nthe parties.  The determination of enforceability of section 4.2 of the Agreement does \\nrequire engaging with the broader factual matrix including the issues raised by the \\nRespondent and the defences available to the Respondent against the backdrop of the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic.   \\n[21] \\nThe Applicant argues that courts routinely enforce contractual obligations by way of \\napplications under Rule 14.05(3)(d). The Applicant cites Parc Downsview Park v. Penguin \\nProperties Inc., 2018 ONCA 666, which concerned an application to enforce an indemnity \\nunder a commercial lease. Penguin Properties Inc. submitted that it was unfair to decide \\nthe dispute by way of application because the nature of the dispute required full production \\nby way of affidavits of documents, examinations for discovery, followed by a trial. The \\nCourt of Appeal held at para 27 that there was no unfairness resulting from the application \\njudge determining the contractual dispute by way of application, instead of directing a trial.  \\nThe Applicant argues that the Court of Appeal stated at para 25 it was “difficult to \\nunderstand what further material evidence about the representations could emerge from a \\nconventional discovery process...”  \\n[22] \\nThe Court of Appeal in Parc Downsview Park v. Penguin Properties Inc. also held at para \\n20 that the “suitability of using an application, rather than an action, to decide a contractual \\ndispute depends upon the specific facts of the case, including the nature and extent of any \\nfactual dispute.”  As discussed below, the specific facts of this case, including the nature \\nand extent of the dispute during the COVID-19 pandemic, warrants an action to determine \\nthe dispute between the parties. Further material evidence could also emerge from \\ndiscovery.  \\nInterpretation of the Agreement \\n2024 ONSC 1823 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n[23] \\nThere is no dispute about the meaning of the Agreement. There is a dispute as to whether \\nsection 4.2 of the Agreement can be characterized as a penalty and therefore, not \\nenforceable against the Respondent.  \\n[24] \\nThe Applicant submits that the Agreement is clear and unambiguous. The Respondent does \\nnot deny the plain language meaning of section 4.2 of the Agreement and the Applicant \\ndoes not deny it failed to provide the Respondent with the reserved production capacity it \\nwas entitled to under the Agreement. The Respondent argues that the Applicant is seeking \\nnot how to interpret section 4.2 but whether it can be enforced.  The Respondent submits \\nthat where the parties disagree is whether the Applicant holds an enforceable right to \\nrecover against the Respondent for product volume shortfalls from 2020-2022. \\n[25] \\nThe Applicant submits that stipulated remedy clauses are enforceable absent penal \\nconsequences and unconscionability (Peachtree II Associates-Dalla L.P. v. 857486 \\nOntario Ltd., 2005 CanLII 23216 (ON CA)).  The Applicant argues that the analysis only \\napplies on breach or non-performance of the contract and does not apply to a conditional \\nevent that is governed by the contract (Bidell Equipment LP v. Caliber Midstream GP LLC, \\n2020 ABCA 478 at para 23).  The Applicant states section 4.2 deals with a conditional \\nevent - inability to meet the minimum - and therefore, the penalty analysis does not apply. \\nThe Applicant further argues that absent unconscionability or oppressive conduct, a court \\nwill give effect to stipulated remedy clauses.  The Applicant states that the provision must \\nbe examined at the time the contract was entered into, which was before the COVID-19 \\npandemic, and therefore the COVID-19 pandemic is irrelevant.  \\n[26] \\nThe Respondent argues that section 4.2 is a penalty clause and not enforceable. The \\nRespondent states that section 4.2 is not a genuine pre-estimate of damages and therefore, \\ncannot be a liquidated damages provision.  The Respondent makes persuasive arguments \\nabout the lack of evidence supporting facts underpinning the Applicant’s losses.  The \\nRespondent reasons that if the argument is successful that section 4.2 is a penalty clause \\nthen section 4.2 operates as an upper limit on the general damages that the Applicant can \\nclaim, rather than as a stipulated sum to be paid. The Applicant’s claim to damages must \\nbe proved and is subject to mitigation. The Respondent argues that there is no evidence of \\nthe Applicant’s actual, or even potential losses under the Agreement.   \\n[27] \\nIn my view, further evidence is required.  Further evidence would assist in determining \\nwhether the clause is penal or unconscionable, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  I \\ndisagree with the Applicant that the COVID-19 pandemic is not relevant in this case. \\nConverting the Application to an Action \\n[28] \\nRule 38.10 (1)(b) provides that on the hearing of an application, the presiding judge may \\norder that the whole application or any issue proceed to trial. \\n[29] \\nThe Court of Appeal held in Family and Children’s Services of Lanark, Leeds and \\nGrenville v. Co-operators General Insurance Company, 2021 ONCA 159 at para 48, “An \\napplication will however be converted to an action where there are material facts in dispute, \\n2024 ONSC 1823 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\ncomplex issues requiring expert evidence or the weighing of evidence, or other need for \\ndiscoveries or further pleadings: see Fort William Band v. Canada (Attorney General), \\n2005 CanLII 28533 (ON SC), 76 O.R. (3d) 228 (S.C.), at paras. 5 and 28-31.” \\n[30] \\nThere are material facts in dispute and there is a need for discoveries or further pleadings. \\nThe Respondent submits that in its Notice of Examination to Mr. Henry of the Applicant, \\nthe Respondent sought production of documents relevant to the greatest loss that could \\nconceivably be proved to have resulted from breach of the minimum volume requirement, \\nsuch as documents relating to other products produce by the Applicant during the relevant \\nperiod and documents related to the Applicant’s profits at the time. The Respondent argues \\nthat the Applicant referred to its financial statements filed on SEDAR but did not produce \\ncopies of any financial documents and the Applicant’s most recent annual report filed on \\nSEDAR is for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022.  \\n[31] \\nThe Respondent also sought any documents that relate to the Applicant\\'s manufacturing \\nline availability for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. The Applicant responded in its answers \\nto undertakings that it has provided all documents it has relating to line availability, which \\nconsists of emails from 2020 advising of disruptions to the line caused by the COVID-19 \\npandemic. It also referred to Mr. Henry\\'s answers to questions on this topic under cross-\\nexamination. The Respondent argues that the Applicant did not provide any internal \\ndocuments showing its manufacturing line capacity during the relevant period. Against that \\nassertion, its financial statement filed on SEDAR for its 2021 fiscal year indicates that it \\nwas still experiencing line capacity constraints as of April 7, 2021 when the statement was \\nprepared. Material facts are clearly in dispute. \\n[32] \\nThe Respondent further argues estoppel and frustration of the contract. In the summer of \\n2020, the Applicant advised the Respondent that it could not schedule its orders until the \\nend of that summer, with the intention that the Respondent would not place any orders \\nduring that period. The Respondent states that these facts raise the issue of whether the \\nApplicant is now estopped from denying the truth of that representation or relying on \\ncircumstances contrary to that representation: i.e., whether the Applicant can now rely on \\nthe Respondent allegedly failing to place minimum orders at a time when it was \\nrepresenting that such orders could not be filled.  \\n[33] \\nThe Applicant argues that the Respondent appears to be relying on estoppel by convention, \\nwhich prevents a contracting party from relying on a contract where, by its words or \\nconduct, it evinces an intention not to rely on the strict terms of the contract and leads the \\ncounterparty to believe the contract will not be relied on. The Applicant cites Grasshopper \\nSolar Corporation v. Independent Electricity System Operator, 2020 ONCA 499 at para \\n55 for the principle that estoppel by convention arises “when both parties to a contract act \\nbased on a shared assumption concerning circumstances relevant to their contract”.  The \\nApplicant submits that there was no shared understanding that the Agreement would not \\nbe enforced. I disagree. The evidence indicates that the parties engaged in multiple \\ndiscussions about the how much the Respondent could and would order and whether the \\nApplicant had capacity to satisfy the order.    \\n2024 ONSC 1823 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\n[34] \\nThe Respondent submits that the contract was frustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In \\nT-City Construction Inc. v. Arivuchelvan, 2020 ONSC 4502, the court noted that whether \\nand to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic had prevented the applicant from fulfilling its \\nobligations under the contract was a material fact that would likely be in dispute.  The \\nApplicant concedes that at most the Respondent could obtain an abatement on the section \\n4.2 fees for a 3-month period when the Applicant’s capacity had constraints. Whether and \\nfor how long a contract was frustrated is a fact-specific analysis.   \\n[35] \\nThe Respondent complains that there is no evidence in the record of the Applicant’s actual \\nproduction capacity or its pre-existing obligations to other customers or other evidence. \\nThe Respondent requested documents that would show the Applicant’s actual \\nmanufacturing line availability and profits for 2020, 2021, and 2022 but the Applicant \\nadvised that documents relating to line availability, consisting of emails had been provided. \\nThe Respondent complains that the emails discussing production line availability are \\nentirely correspondence with the Respondent and do not allow the Respondent to test the \\nApplicant’s evidence on whether what it said at the time was accurate.   The Respondent \\nargues that such evidence was not available to adduce without the benefit of discovery. The \\nRespondent further alleges that the Applicant saw an increase in revenue generated from \\nco-manufacturing contracts, a growth of co-manufacturing volume, and a net revenue \\nincrease. It is clear that the issues stemming from the Application are deeply factual and \\nrequire discoveries.    \\nDisposition \\n[36] \\nAccordingly, I order the whole Application be converted to an action and proceed to trial.  \\nI am not ruling on payment of outstanding invoices, even though it is not disputed, in an \\neffort to avoid an inconsistent finding or a fractured proceeding.    \\n[37] \\nI am not inclined to award costs to any party given the outcome.  Also, I have considered \\nthe Applicant’s submissions that the Respondent did not raise an objection to the matter \\nproceeding by way of an application until later in the process and that both parties had to \\nmake additional submissions on issues raised in the hearing.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nJUSTICE J.

She argues her then counsel, Stephen Moreau, and counsel for the Crown jointly forced \\nher, under duress, to sign the minutes and the full and final release, which the Crown denies.1 \\n[2] \\nThe parties agree the law I must apply to decide this motion is set out in Kawartha Capital \\nCorp. v. 1723766 Ontario Limited 2020 ONCA 763.

In addition, Fay Smith filed two motions dated January 03, 2023 and March \\n21, 2023.  The latter asks for relief that can only be claimed if the minutes are set aside and accordingly it was not \\nargued. \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n2 \\n \\n \\nthat she was subjected to pressure that left her with no choice but to submit, and second, that the \\npressure was illegitimate: Kawartha Capital, at para 11. \\n[3] \\nIn determining whether the pressure exerted was such as to leave a party with no choice, \\nthe Kawartha Capital court set out the following factors to consider, at para. 11: \\na) Did the party protest at the time the contract was entered into? \\nb) Was there an effective alternative course open to the party alleging coercion? \\nc) Did the party receive independent legal advice? \\nd) After entering into the contract, did the party take steps to avoid it? \\nBackground \\n[4] \\nThe action was brought in 2018 by Fay Smith and two of her children because of the tragic \\n2006 workplace death of her husband, Raymond Campeau.    \\n[5] \\nThe Crown did not deliver a statement of defence and it was noted in default in January \\n2020. Default judgment was granted on January 06, 2021. Although the plaintiffs were self-\\nrepresented when the claim was issued, they subsequently retained Mr. Moreau’s firm. He \\nprepared and argued their motion for default judgment. \\n[6] \\nIn February 2021 the Crown delivered a motion to set aside the default judgment. On \\nFebruary 19, 2021, a case conference was held before Thomas R.S.J. The Crown’s motion was set \\nfor hearing on June 28, 2021. \\n[7] \\nOn June 06, 2021, prior to conducting cross-examinations, the parties consented to an order \\nsetting aside the default judgment and agreed to attend a mediation in September 2021. As a \\ncondition of setting aside the default judgment, the Crown agreed to pay the plaintiffs’ full \\nindemnity costs up to January 06, 2021 (fixed at $105,726.26) as well as partial indemnity costs \\nfrom January 06, 2021, to May 31, 2021 (fixed at $43,744.74). The record reflects these costs were \\npaid by October 28, 2021. \\n[8] \\nThe mediation took place on September 20, 2021. Minutes of settlement were signed by \\nthe parties on September 21, 2021. A full and final release was signed on October 07, 2021 (though \\nonly witnessed later that month). The settlement funds were received by Stephen Moreau on \\nNovember 03, 2021, and the order dismissing the action without costs was issued and entered on \\nNovember 10, 2021. \\n[9] \\nFay Smith, though not her children, moved to set aside the minutes, release and order on \\nJanuary 03, 2023. \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPositions of the Parties \\n[10] \\nFay Smith submits her counsel and Crown counsel are jointly responsible for coercing her, \\nunder duress, into signing the minutes and the full and final release. She denies she received \\nindependent legal advice about the resolution. She argues the pressure that was placed upon her at \\nthe mediation and thereafter caused her to have ‘a major meltdown’. \\n[11] \\nEvidence of this duress, she submits, includes the following: \\na. She was told by her lawyer not to speak or to ask any questions during the \\nmediation; \\nb. The mediator, the Honourable Justice Dennis O’Connor, worked at a law firm \\nthat represents senior Ministry staff. Despite her belief this was a conflict of \\ninterest, her counsel and Crown counsel agreed to this mediator; \\nc. Her counsel normally sent her documents well in advance so that she could \\nconsider them carefully. For example, she was provided a month to consider \\nthe draft agreement to set aside the default judgment.  With respect to the \\nminutes of settlement, she felt she had no time to consider her position; \\nd. Although she had a week to provide her input for their mediation brief, she was \\nnot provided with the Crown’s brief in advance; \\ne. At the mediation, they pressured her to ‘throw out numbers’ and she did not \\nunderstand that doing so could lead to a binding agreement; \\nf. The mediation ended at 5 p.m. without an agreement in place; \\ng. At 6:10 p.m. the Crown sent draft minutes to her counsel, saying they needed \\nthem finalized that day; \\nh. At 6:30 p.m. her counsel emailed her the proposed agreement, and at 7:15 p.m. \\nhe emailed her the draft minutes. She briefly reviewed them but had concerns \\nabout a non-disparagement clause which she believed would impact the \\ncriminal investigation into her husband’s death; \\ni. At 8:54 p.m. she emailed her counsel reminding him she was travelling back to \\nSudbury and needed time to respond; \\nj. The next day her counsel emailed her saying he expected her to sign and that \\nthe Crown was pressuring him to respond to the draft minutes. She did not \\nimmediately respond to his email because she was preparing to return to \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n4 \\n \\n \\nSudbury from Toronto. She felt pressured by urgency that she believed was \\nmanufactured by the lawyers; \\nk. At 10:45 a.m. she spoke with a lawyer in her counsel’s firm and told her she \\nwas not comfortable with the non-disparagement clause and had other concerns \\nshe wished to discuss with Mr. Moreau, but she was travelling; \\nl. At 12:21 p.m. her lawyer emailed her saying that he believed she had a binding \\nsettlement and that if she did not sign the minutes he would be forced to remove \\nhimself from the case. He told her that her claim had zero chance of succeeding \\nand if she chose not to sign the minutes, she would be on her own; \\nm. Later that day Crown counsel sent an email saying they required the signed \\nminutes by end of day; \\nn. Around 5 p.m. her lawyer emailed her saying that if she did not sign by 6 p.m. \\nshe would have to deal with Crown counsel directly. Because of this ‘extreme \\nduress’ she signed the minutes when she returned home;  \\no. She was misled to believe there was a binding agreement after the mediation \\nand she had no choice but to sign the minutes; and \\np. She felt she had no other option but to sign the full and final release. \\n[12] \\nFay Smith further argues her counsel and Crown counsel forced her into signing the \\nminutes that contained a non-disparagement clause to prevent a criminal investigation, thus \\ncovering-up the Ministry’s alleged negligent acts and omissions that caused her husband’s death. \\n[13] \\nThe Crown submits there is a legally significant difference between a litigant feeling \\npressured and acting under duress. The former, though unpleasant, is to be expected in litigation.  \\nThe Crown argues that duress cannot be made out when the facts of this case are viewed through \\nthe lens of Kawartha Capital. \\n[14] \\n The Crown disputes that Fay Smith was left with no alternative but to sign the minutes.  \\nIn the alternative, the Crown submits that the pressure applied in the circumstances was not \\nillegitimate. Finally, the Crown argues that if illegitimate duress is made out, there is no evidence \\nthe Crown exerted any of that duress.  In other words, duress exerted by counsel for the plaintiff, \\nbut not by the Crown, cannot invalidate the minutes of settlement and full and final release. \\nAnalysis \\n[15] \\nFor the following reasons, I find Fay Smith has not established she signed the minutes \\nunder duress. A careful review of the record reveals a pattern of detailed, thoughtful independent \\nlegal advice. It also sets out a litigation strategy that, over a significant period, explored resolution \\nof the action while defending the Crown’s motion. \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n5 \\n \\n \\n[16] \\nAs would be expected, Stephen Moreau provided some advice that he knew would not find \\nfavour with his clients. There is no evidence he ever pressured or rushed the plaintiffs into making \\ndecisions or told them what to do; he always left the decisions to them. Nor is there any evidence \\nthat any of the plaintiffs ever expressed to their counsel that they felt pressured to decide. For \\nexample, when time was requested to make a decision, Mr. Moreau provided it. \\n[17] \\nI find the pressure described by Fay Smith is no different than the pressure any litigant \\nexperiences.  It does not rise close to what is required for economic duress. There is often self-\\ndoubt and parties wonder if they obtained the best result. They wonder if more can or could have \\nbeen done. \\n[18] \\nFurther, the evidence does not support Fay Smith’s contention that her counsel and counsel \\nfor the Crown colluded to cover up Ministry malfeasance and/or nonfeasance. In the end, I find \\nFay Smith made considered decisions based on the independent legal advice she received. It is \\nsignificant that it was not until January 2023 that she raised the allegation of duress, despite many \\nopportunities to do so after the mediation concluded. \\n[19] \\nA summary analysis of Mr. Moreau’s continuing efforts on behalf of the plaintiffs and in \\nadvising the plaintiffs demonstrates quite clearly that nothing less than professionalism was \\nexercised on their behalf. \\nJanuary 2021 to September 20, 2021 \\n[20] \\nIn an email dated January 14, 2021, the same day Mr. Moreau was contacted by counsel \\nfor the Crown, he alerted the plaintiffs to the Crown’s intention to move to set aside the default \\njudgment.  He raised the hope that their costs to obtain the default judgment would be paid by the \\nCrown if the default judgment was set aside. \\n[21] \\nTwo days later Mr. Moreau sent to the plaintiffs a detailed email responsive to questions \\nraised by one of the plaintiffs. The email also contained additional advice, including the possibility \\nthat while discussing their motion, there “may be openings to say, ‘look you may win this motion \\nbut the humane thing to do is to just settle the whole case quietly’”. \\n[22] \\nOn February 18, 2021, Stephen Moreau sent to the plaintiffs an email containing his initial \\nassessment and advice regarding the Crown’s motion record. He cogently set out why he believed \\ndefending the motion would be “very challenging”. He also set out some of the Crown’s defences \\nin the action itself, noting they were “very strong”. He further asked for instructions from them to \\npursue global settlement at the right time. He repeated this request the next day and received a \\npositive response from Jamie Campeau. \\n[23] \\nOn May 21, 2021, Stephen Moreau answered an email from Fay Smith regarding the \\nupcoming cross-examinations on the affidavits filed for the Crown’s motion. He told her that while \\nspeaking with Crown counsel he “took advantage of the opportunity to see what a settlement might \\nlook like…a settlement of everything where you and your children are paid some monies in \\nexchange for being 100% done with the lawsuit (emphasis in original)”. He closed the email saying \\nhe would update her with the Crown’s response. I note he did not, as before, ask for permission to \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n6 \\n \\n \\nexplore settlement of the action. From this I conclude permission had been granted prior to this \\nconversation with the Crown, which is borne out in later emails. \\n[24] \\nLess than a week later, the Crown made an offer to the plaintiffs through their counsel: \\nagree to set aside the default judgment (with full indemnity costs and partial indemnity costs) and \\nthe parties would attend mediation, likely paid entirely by the Crown. In an email to the plaintiffs, \\nStephen Moreau set out this offer as well as his opinion on the strength of the Crown’s motion, \\nsaying the plaintiffs “may not want to hear this, but it’s true. I strongly predict you will lose [the \\nCrown’s motion]”. \\n[25] \\nPut another way, the Crown would not agree to mediation of the action at an early stage \\nunless the default judgment was set aside on consent. Stephen Moreau explained why he believed \\nit was a “serious offer worth considering”, and he was “[h]appy to talk by phone [with Fay Smith \\nand/or her] children regarding this”. \\n[26] \\nAn hour or so later, Fay Smith responded to Stephen Moreau, indicating that the plaintiffs \\nwere not interested in mediation and that they wished to defend the Crown’s motion. Her position \\nwas that they would rather lose the motion than agree to set aside default judgment. \\n[27] \\nStephen Moreau responded and wrote he was “a bit surprised” and stated: \\nEverything I have done for you these past four months has been, as we \\ndiscussed, to get them to the point where we could try and settle the case. I \\nworked many hours…in order to get to the point of telling our opponents \\nthat a bunch of media are coming [to the motion] not because we wanted \\nmedia but because we wanted to scare them into a corner.  I fought the \\nredactions and sealing orders issue not because it helped you win the set \\naside motion but because I wanted Ontario to fear that the embarrassment \\nwould come out in the open, thus pushing them to talk settlement.  \\nAll of the above was done on explicit instruction to do it as part of a master \\nstrategy to get them to settlement talks.  And now that is has worked, you \\ntell me to stop and argue a motion I feel you have very little chance to win… \\nBut I return to the main point.  What we have managed to wrangle out of \\nthem is what I was asked by you to get and worked hard to get and now you \\nare saying you do not want it? This is what causes me serious confusion. \\nI would appreciate a call perhaps with you and Jamie and Kevin to ensure I \\nunderstand the instructions and why it is they have changed so dramatically. \\n[28] \\nJamie Campeau responded the next day by email. She apologized for “misinterpretation” \\non their part and asked five questions to help them “make a better more informed decision”.  \\nStephen Moreau responded that evening. He recommended a phone call but took the opportunity \\nto provide a detailed response to each of their questions in writing.   \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n7 \\n \\n \\n[29] \\nHe followed up that email with another one, over three pages in length, containing advice \\nabout the litigation. The latter email refers to a Zoom meeting with the plaintiffs the next day. By \\nemail the next morning, May 28, 2021, Fay Smith thanked him for this email and said “it was very \\nhelpful on how this works. I will have more questions for [sic] at 4 pm”, the time of the Zoom \\nmeeting. \\n[30] \\nI conclude Stephen Moreau received instructions to proceed with the Crown’s proposal \\nbecause on June 03, 2021, Crown counsel spoke with him and confirmed the Crown’s terms on \\nsetting aside the default judgment and proceeding to mediation. Stephen Moreau requested minor \\nmodifications to the Crown’s proposal, but more importantly, he declined the three mediators \\nrecommended by the Crown and instead suggested three retired judges. One of those judges, \\nformer Associate Chief Justice O’Connor, was chosen by the Crown. \\n[31] \\nThe Honourable Dennis O’Connor clearly set out the terms of the mediation in a letter \\ndated June 21, 2021. Among the terms were the following: \\na. Any party may withdraw from the mediation at any time; \\nb. The parties will ensure their representatives have full authority \\nto settle; and \\nc. The parties understand the mediation may result in a “settlement \\nagreement that contains legally binding obligations that are \\nenforceable in a court of law”. \\n[32] \\nThe plaintiffs had this letter a month before the mediation. This provided them with more \\nthan enough time to consider its terms.  The record also reveals the question of whether the \\nmediator was in a conflict of interest was considered and correctly dismissed as a non-issue. \\n[33] \\nOn June 24, 2021, Fay Smith wrote to Stephen Moreau with several questions, including \\nabout the motion records and the mediation. She confirmed she was working on the mediation \\nbrief.  Mr. Moreau responded to her questions the next day and cautioned her not to draft a brief \\nbecause they would not be able to rely on it for the mediation; rather, he would use her memos to \\ndraft the brief. \\n[34] \\nOn July 14, 2021, Thomas R.S.J., released his consent endorsement which, among other \\nthings, set aside the default judgment and fixed the plaintiffs’ full and partial indemnity costs. \\n[35] \\nOn August 23, 2021, Stephen Moreau wrote to Fay Smith about two letters dated 2007 that \\nshe had sent to him. These letters related to her claim against the WSIB. In his email, Mr. Moreau \\ngave her what he described as “bad news”. In short, his opinion based on the letters was that her \\nclaim against the WSIB was statute-barred. As a result, he noted the following: \\nPlease consider this information and the conclusion that you cannot win \\nyour case as a result.  If this now means “take what you can” in mediation, \\nit means just that.  This is unfortunate news but I must deliver the truth here \\n(emphasis in original). \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n8 \\n \\n \\n[36] \\nFay Smith acknowledged receipt of this email. \\n[37] \\nAbout a week prior to the mediation, Fay Smith wrote to Stephen Moreau with some minor \\nchanges for their extensive and detailed brief, but otherwise noted it was “excellent”. \\n[38] \\nThe next day, on September 14, 2021, Mr. Moreau wrote to the plaintiffs and asked to have \\na meeting with them to prepare for the mediation. He also set out some points for them to consider \\nin the interim. He cautioned them “in the strongest of language (emphasis in original)” not to speak \\nunless asked a direct question by the mediator. He explained that the mediator was the former \\nAssociate Chief Justice of Ontario and that he would rather hear from the lawyers. He further \\nexplained the mediator would give the lawyers time to speak with their clients privately about what \\nwas going on. This evidence does not support Fay Smith’s position that she was told she could not \\nsay anything at the mediation; rather it was advice on how best to conduct herself before the former \\nAssociate Chief Justice of Ontario. \\n[39] \\nMore importantly, Mr. Moreau reiterated their case had “major challenges” and he \\ncautioned them not to expect a particularly large offer. He further provided the following advice: \\nI can only advise on what the good and bad is, what you should consider, \\nwhat your chances are, what you can obtain if you fight on, and so on.  I \\ncannot tell you to take or reject an offer.  I may, if the offer is very poor, tell \\nyou that you should in my view reject it.  At the other end, if really good, I \\nmay say “you really should take this offer.”  Anywhere in the middle you \\nwill hear “it is up to you but here are the various considerations. \\n[40] \\nMr. Moreau followed-up a few days later with another email setting out his opinion with \\nrespect to a new issue raised in the Crown’s brief: the limitation period for claims by an Estate. In \\na second email later that day, he set out what he described as “very bad news”: based on his \\nresearch, the limitation period for the claim by the Estate is two years from the date of death (not \\nthe date of discovery of the claim). In addition, their Family Law Act claims were linked to that \\ntime period and expired at the same time. He concluded the email with the following advice: “I \\nsuspect the offer we get Monday will be quite low. I had hoped it would be low-to-middle, but \\nnow lower seems best we can hope for”. He repeated this caution in another email about an hour \\nlater. \\n[41] \\nOn this record, the plaintiffs were well prepared for, and knew what to expect at, the \\nmediation. They actively sought out and received advice from their lawyer in the almost eight \\nmonths leading up to the mediation. None of this evidence suggests Stephen Moreau rushed the \\nplaintiffs into making decisions. At one point it appeared the plaintiffs did not want to proceed \\nwith mediation, but after further discussions with counsel, they chose to attend mediation. This \\nwas a choice that on this evidence was theirs to make. They had an alternative course of action: \\nnot to attend the mediation. \\nThe mediation to January 03, 2023 \\n[42] \\nThe mediation took the full day on September 20, 2021. Fay Smith participated in Toronto \\nwith her counsel. Shortly after the mediation ended, Crown counsel sent to Stephen Moreau draft \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n9 \\n \\n \\nminutes of settlement, about two pages long, and suggested their client would like the minutes \\nexecuted that day. \\n[43] \\nMr. Moreau responded with a change that would limit the risk with WSIB, but otherwise \\nhe sent it to the plaintiffs and suggested he expected the change to appear in the next draft. The \\nchoice of words in his email is significant and is set out below: \\nAttached is a draft.  I have told them they forgot the wording I want to \\ndescribe the monies so as to limit the risk as we disclose this to the WSIB.  \\nI want their next draft with that fixed. \\n[44] \\nThis evidence supports the Crown’s position that an agreement was reached at the \\nmediation, subject to settling the wording of the minutes and the full and final release. Mr. \\nMoreau’s very brief email suggests he was waiting for this draft.  In other words, there is no \\nsurprise that draft minutes were provided. Further, there is no negotiation regarding the amount of \\nthe settlement. \\n[45] \\nA few hours later, Mr. Moreau sent to the plaintiffs a copy of his email to Crown counsel \\nin which he suggested wording that he believed would “help [him] with the WSIB”. Fay Smith \\nresponded to this email and pointed out that Jamie was driving home and needed her help to sign \\ndocuments. She pointed out that she wanted to talk to him about the non-disparagement clause the \\nnext day. He responded: “Tomorrow is fine”. Contrary to Fay Smith’s position, there was no \\npressure to sign the minutes the same day as the mediation. \\n[46] \\nThe next morning Fay Smith spoke with Stephen Moreau’s co-counsel. In an email at 12:22 \\np.m. that day, Mr. Moreau wrote to Fay Smith. He stated that they spoke that morning at 10:50 \\na.m., which Fay Smith denied in oral argument. He confirmed his advice, which he said \\n“forcefully” to her during that call as follows: \\na. Legally, I believe you have a settlement.  It may not be signed yet, but \\nthey have a near 100% chance of getting a court to enforce what is now \\na settled claim. \\nb. Professionally, I negotiated that settlement.  I bargained hard to get our \\nformer Associate Chief Justice to push Ontario into a very good \\nsettlement (when you consider your claim has basically 0% chance of \\nsucceeding). \\nc. I therefore will not go back to the other side and say “my client is not \\nsigning”.  I will look unprofessional and I am not prepared to do that. \\nd. I left it with you to think about your actions and next steps.  I will try \\nand keep counsel at bay for today but I am asking you to choose one of \\ntwo options: \\na) Sign the agreement you have already made; or \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n10 \\n \\n \\nb) Tell me you are refusing. \\ne. If you say “a”, I will have the document cleaned up for signature. \\nf. If you say “b”, I will professionally, in writing, and bccing you so you \\ncan have the full communication, advise opposing counsel that I no \\nlonger represent the Plaintiffs due to a breakdown in the solicitor-client \\nrelationship.  At that point, Faye, you can take whatever position you \\nwant to take.  You can tell Ontario that the deal is off and see what \\nhappens.  You can tell them that you do not like the “shut up” agreement \\n(or at least, what you say is a “shut up” agreement), and discover for \\nyourself what happens when you tell Ontario that [hint, having \\nnegotiated hundreds of these settlements before, Ontario will [illegible] \\na more strongly worded agreement because you, having told them that \\nyou do not like it, will have essentially told them that you intend to say \\nall kinds of things about them…now they will want something more \\nakin to a non-disclosure agreement which you will not sign, quite \\nrightly…point is  you need to understand the consequences of your \\nactions]. \\n[47] \\nHe closed the email with the following: \\nI am sorry that this very firm email comes after over 18 months of solid \\nwork and what I think has been a good partnership to see you through \\ndifficult times.  I have no choice but to write it so that the situation as it \\ncurrently stands is clearly and accurately placed out there. \\nI appreciate the compliments you paid to me on the phone.  I know you \\nknow we have done the very best job for you.  But now it is up to you to \\nmake a choice. \\n[48] \\nThroughout the afternoon Stephen Moreau emailed the plaintiffs and told them Crown \\ncounsel were following up on the minutes and he was keeping them at bay. He asked for \\ninstructions several times. \\n[49] \\nAround 5 p.m. counsel for the Crown provided Mr. Moreau with minutes signed by their \\nclient. They asked the plaintiffs to do the same by the end of the day. \\n[50] \\nAt this point Stephen Moreau wrote to the plaintiffs and set a deadline of 6 p.m. for them \\nto decide. Around 6:30 p.m. Jamie Campeau emailed Mr. Moreau and said that “unless Faye has \\na change of heart in the next 5 minutes, you should expect her to send a signed and scanned copy \\nof the Minutes of Settlement shorty…Once you have my mother’s signature you won’t encounter \\nany challenges from my brother or I signing”. \\n[51] \\nApproximately ten minutes later Fay Smith emailed the signed minutes to Stephen Moreau.  \\nShe asked him if he would “be filing” the dismissal order and the final release. She also asked a \\nquestion about the non-disparagement clause. Mr. Moreau asked her to clarify her question. A few \\n2024 ONSC 1796 (CanLII)\\n11 \\n \\n \\nhours later Mr. Moreau’s co-counsel provided an answer to the question which Fay Smith \\nconfirmed was responsive to her issue. She also confirmed that “both [she] and Stephen did a great \\njob in this case…”.  Notably, there is no mention of duress. \\n[52] \\nFay Smith’s argument that she signed the minutes under “extreme duress” is without merit.  \\nConsider the draft minutes were brief, two pages long, and the culmination of about eighteen \\nmonths of legal advice within the litigation. When she asked for time to consider, it was granted.  \\nA day after the mediation ended, Stephen Moreau gave the plaintiffs a choice: sign the minutes or \\nnot. That he indicated he could no longer act for them if they chose not to did not amount to undue \\nduress. As he explained, his professional ethical obligations prevented him from acting if they \\nchose the latter.   \\n[53] \\nI conclude the delay in signing the minutes was related to the potential impact of the non-\\ndisparagement clause. Fay Smith and Mr. Moreau exchanged several emails about the non-\\ndisparagement clause after the minutes were signed. In an email sent on September 22, 2021, Fay \\nSmith explained “[t]hat’s why I was having such a hard time with this agreement I believe that \\ncriminal negligence charges will be laid against all parties involved…”.  It is significant that she \\ndid not take this opportunity to mention she was tricked into throwing out numbers at the mediation \\nthat she did not expect could be accepted by the Crown. Rather, she sets out the real reason for her \\ndelay in signing: the possible impact of the non-disparagement clause on a criminal investigation \\ninto her husband’s death. \\n[54] \\nBy November 10, 2021, the settlement funds had been paid to the plaintiffs, the full and \\nfinal release had been executed and the action had been dismissed without costs. At no point while \\nthose steps were taken did Fay Smith signal that she had been forced, under duress, to sign the \\nminutes, despite many opportunities while communicating with her counsel. \\nConclusion \\n[55] \\nFor these reasons, Fay Smith’s motions are dismissed. \\n[56] \\nIf the parties cannot agree on costs, the Crown may file written submissions of no more \\nthan two pages, double-spaced, not including a bill of costs and any offers to settle, within fifteen \\ndays of this decision. Fay Smith may file responding submissions of no more than two pages, \\ndouble-spaced, within thirty days of the date of this decision. The Crown may file reply \\nsubmissions of no more than two pages, double-spaced, within forty days of this decision. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRegional Senior Justice Patrick J.

The Applicant father resided in Canada before and after the marriage. There is one \\nchild, B.S.A., born January 21, 2015. The Respondent mother and B.S.A. child joined the \\nApplicant in Canada December 29, 2015. The parties separated less than four years later, October \\n1, 2019.    \\n[2] \\nDespite being able to finalize and agree on many issues, the parties were unable to come \\nto an agreement regarding i) child support - retroactive and prospective; ii) s.7 expenses and each \\nparties contribution; iii) spousal support; iv) travel with the child; and v) the location for pick up \\nand drop off exchanges of their daughter.   \\n[3] \\nSince separation, B.S.A. has resided with the Respondent. The Applicant has parenting \\ntime one day each weekend and one 3-4 hour visit during the week. The agreement permits \\nadditional parenting time which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nParties Positions \\ni) \\nChild Support \\n[4] \\nCommencing late 2019, the Applicant paid monthly child support of $500 directly to the \\nRespondent. From September 2021 to March 2022, the Applicant paid $400 child support. This \\nwas increased to $450 effective April 1, 2022, and has remained the same since.  \\n[5] \\nThe Respondent seeks retroactive child support in the amount of $600 per month and \\nargued arrears of $7200 as of October 2023. The Respondent also asked the Court to impute \\nincome to the Applicant. The Respondent argued the Applicant made more income than he \\ndeclared. In the alternative, the Applicant is deliberately underemployed.  \\n[6] \\nThe Applicant argued his pay has always been deposited into his business account. He has \\nnot received any additional monies. He explained why his income decreased when working for \\nRTI and that his income should not be imputed to more than what he earned. Further, he is not \\nunderemployed, and his salary is commensurate with what others with his experience earn.   \\nii) \\nSection 7 Expenses \\n[7] \\nThe Respondent has been responsible for the child’s health care and expenses and seeks \\nreimbursement for glasses, medication, and vitamins not covered by benefits. Further, their child \\nattends martial arts, basketball, swimming, skating, and two language classes. The Respondent \\nargued the Applicant should contribute to these expenses. It is her position the s.7 expenses should \\nbe shared equally provided the Respondent is not enrolled in classes. During this period, she \\nrequested the s.7 expenses be proportioned 70/30.    \\n[8] \\nThe Applicant is willing to share s.7 expenses on condition he is consulted in advance, \\nshares in the decision, and approves or agrees with the activity. He is not prepared to share \\nexpenses for programs or activities he disagrees with. The Applicant father expressed concern \\nsome activities may be outside what he can afford and not reasonable. The Applicant also \\nexpressed concern that the Respondent provides all receipts for s.7 expenses once a year, making \\nit difficult for him to find the funds to reimburse the Respondent. He requested he be required to \\npay a set sum each month to be attributed to the s.7 expenses. Alternatively, the Respondent be \\nordered to provide him copies of the receipts monthly or within a set number of days after the \\nexpense was incurred.  \\niii) \\nSpousal Support \\n[9] \\nThe Respondent raised the issue of spousal support retroactive from the date of separation \\nuntil April 2022 when she graduated. If the Court finds she is entitled to spousal support, her \\nposition is it be ordered at the lower end of the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines (SSAG). The \\nRespondent argued she had no source of income after the separation and was entitled to spousal \\nsupport during the time she was enrolled in school. \\n[10] \\nThe Applicant disagreed the Respondent was entitled to spousal support. If the court found \\nshe was entitled, he understood his responsibilities and was prepared to pay according to the \\nSSAG. The Applicant argued the Respondent did not provide him with sufficient information \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nabout her true income or access to funds for the parties to agree spousal support was warranted. \\nFurther, she had access and was in receipt of other funds and was employed.   \\niv) \\nTravel with Child \\n[11] \\nEach party seeks leave to travel with their daughter without the need for permission from \\nthe other parent. The Respondent wants the freedom to travel anywhere including countries not \\npart of the Hague Convention. The Respondent would like to travel to Iran to visit family with \\ntheir daughter. She argued there is no risk for her to travel to other countries including those not \\nsignatories to the Hague Convention. She argued she has strong ties to Ontario including a secure \\njob and therefore, is not a risk to flee with the child. She argued it would be in B.S.A.’s best interest \\nto be able to see the world and travel. \\n[12] \\nThe Applicant argued both parties should have consent from the other to travel outside \\nCanada with B.S.A. and consent should not be withheld unreasonably. Further, neither party \\nshould be permitted to travel to counties not part of the Hague Convention. In the alternative, if \\nthe Court determines the Respondent may travel freely with the child without restrictions, so \\nshould he. He would like to travel with their daughter on vacations and trips and not be forbidden \\nfrom doing so by the Respondent. The Respondent mother is opposed to the Applicant father \\ntravelling with their child. She argued he does not exercise his current parenting time, has \\ncancelled, and has not proven that he can care for their daughter properly for an extended period \\nand has yet to have B.S.A. overnight. \\nv) \\nLocation of Pick Ups/Drop Offs \\n[13] \\nLastly, the parties disagreed about changing the pick-up/drop-off location of their daughter. \\nThe current arrangement had the Applicant attend at the Respondent’s apartment complex on the \\n16th floor. The Respondent would remain in her apartment unit and let their daughter meet the \\nApplicant by the elevator when he arrived.  \\n[14] \\nThe Applicant seeks to have the exchanges occur in a public area, either the building lobby \\nor a nearby restaurant or community centre. He wanted to ensure all future exchanges are captured \\nby security cameras or other persons. He expressed concern that allegations could be made that \\nput him in a difficult position to defend himself.  \\n[15] \\nThe Respondent refused to change the location expressing concern for her safety despite \\nthe fact there are no security cameras on this floor but there are cameras in the lobby area.  \\nIssues \\n[16] \\nThe following issues remain unresolved and must be determined: \\na. What is the father’s income for the purpose of calculating child support and his \\ncontribution to section 7 expenses?  \\nb. Should the court impute income to the father? \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nc. What is the amount of child support payable from October 1, 2019, to present, and \\nongoing? \\nd. What s.7 expenses has the mother paid since separation and what s.7 expenses does \\nshe anticipate going forward? \\ne. What is each parent’s proportionate share of the s.7 expenses?  \\nf. Is the mother entitled to spousal support payable from October 1, 2019, until her \\ngraduation in the spring of 2022?  \\ng. Whether the parties can travel without the consent of the other party during their \\nparenting time? \\nh. Where should the child be picked up and dropped off? \\nSummary of Evidence \\n[17] \\nBefore calculating child support and s.7 expenses, it is necessary to determine the \\nApplicant’s income. Much of the trial focussed on this issue. \\n[18] \\nUpon arrival in Canada, the parties lived in Montreal for a short period of time before \\nmoving to Toronto where they continue to reside. The Applicant father held several different \\npositions before obtaining full-time employment as a truck driver in July 2019. Throughout his \\nemployment until the present, his pay has been deposited directly into his CIBC business bank \\naccount. The Applicant was terminated in January 2023 after working for the same company for \\ntwo years. He did not find a new job until late April and earned $18,855.76 between then and \\nAugust of 2023. \\n[19] \\nThe Respondent attended university and graduated with her law degree in Afghanistan in \\n2012. Prior to the marriage she worked as a lawyer and practiced family and criminal law. Upon \\ncoming to Canada, the Respondent mother attended Adult Learning classes and graduated with \\nher Ontario Secondary School Diploma in June 2018. She subsequently enrolled at Centennial \\nCollege in the Software Engineering Technology Co-op program and graduated in 2022. She is \\ncurrently employed with the Ministry of the Solicitor General as a business applications \\nadministrator with an annual salary of $79,622.92. \\n[20] \\nThe parties’ relationship began to deteriorate in late 2018. The Applicant father left the \\nhome in early 2019 for several months before returning in hopes of a reconciliation. Unfortunately, \\nthe couple was unable to overcome their difficulties and officially separated October 1, 2019. Since \\nthat date, the Applicant has paid monthly child support except for two months, October 2019, and \\nFebruary 2022. \\n[21] \\nThe Applicant testified he worked as a truck driver for a numbered company, 2699047 \\nOntario Inc. He changed companies in December 2019 that same year and remained with RTI until \\nhis termination in January 2023. Initially, he drove the same route from Toronto to Montreal. In \\nAugust 2021, the company reduced the number of trips to Montreal and eventually assigned that \\nroute to one driver. The Applicant’s salary decreased based on the company’s decision. The \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\nApplicant produced almost all his driver log books to support his evidence that he was no longer \\ndriving long routes, and to confirm days he worked, where he went, and his hours. The terms of \\nthe Applicant’s contract changed with the short haul routes. He was paid a weekly salary that was \\nnot variable or dependent on the number of hours he drove. The Applicant explained, it did not \\nmatter if he worked 30 hours or 45 hours, he still made the same amount.  \\n[22] \\nThroughout his employment as a truck driver, his pay was deposited into a business account \\nwith CIBC in the name of Azimi Transport Inc. Those records were filed with the Court for the \\nperiod beginning May 1, 2019, to August 31, 2023. It is clear from these records, the Applicant \\nreceived payments from a numbered company, 2699047 Ontario Inc., in varying amounts from \\nJuly 15, 2019, to December 16, 2019. From December 17, 2019, to December 28, 2022, the \\nApplicant received payments from Dhruv Transport Inc. In May 2023, the Applicant began \\nreceiving mobile deposit payments into that account, consistent with his evidence of his new \\nemployment with Atlantic Courier & Cartage Ltd. \\n[23] \\nThe Respondent claimed the Applicant earned more money than what was reflected in his \\naccounts, and he must have other bank accounts that he failed to disclose. In response, the \\nApplicant produced a letter from CIBC confirming he only has two accounts, one personal and \\none business.  \\n[24] \\nThe Respondent challenged the Applicant with respect to two loans he received from \\nfriends. The loans were provided in the form of cheques. The Respondent questioned the Applicant \\nif the cheques were ever deposited and if so when and into which account. The second cheque was \\ndated March 12, 2023, for $4000.00. The Applicant advised he located where the funds were \\ndeposited, however, the Respondent withdrew her challenge of this cheque and chose to focus on \\nthe first cheque. It was dated October 17, 2022, in the amount of $3500.00. The Applicant was \\ninitially unsure which account the cheque was deposited to and believed it was his personal account \\nin January, three months after the cheque was received, due to a deposit for the same amount. \\nOvernight, he determined the funds had been deposited into his CIBC line of credit and produced \\na screenshot confirming the cheque was deposited on October 24, 2022, a few days later.  \\n[25] \\nThe Respondent next questioned the Applicant where the $3500.00 came from that was \\ndeposited into his personal account on January 23, 2023. These funds were transferred from the \\nApplicant’s line of credit on the same date as evident from the screenshot that confirmed the \\nOctober 24, 2022, deposit. \\n[26] \\nThe Respondent sought to discredit the Applicant by suggesting he improperly had her \\ncreate employment letters in the past. Therefore, the Court should not rely on the employment \\nletters the Applicant produced regarding any income and employment. She argued it is easy to \\nproduce a letter and its accuracy and truthfulness should be questioned. The Applicant testified he \\ndid not recognize the handwriting on the draft letter of employment, nor had he worked for the \\ncompany on the top of the letter, and he had never seen the letter before. The Respondent did not \\ncall any other evidence from the company or testify to efforts she made to contact the signatory at \\nthe phone numbers on the letters. \\n[27] \\nThe Respondent suggested the Applicant collected the Canada Emergency Response \\nBenefit (“CERB”) in 2020 despite being employed. She argued he was not entitled to receive \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nCERB and did so fraudulently. The Applicant’s bank account statements reflect the CERB \\ndeposit(s), but no evidence was presented to demonstrate he was not entitled. The Respondent \\nacknowledged that she collected CERB in 2020 when she was unable to secure employment.   \\n[28] \\nThe Respondent argued the Applicant’s income should be imputed at a minimum annual \\nsalary of $70,000. She suggested to the Applicant that he often received cash payments from his \\nemployer. The Applicant disagreed and repeated any monies he earned were deposited directly \\nfrom the company into his bank account. The Respondent questioned the Applicant about the \\nsudden decrease in his income in August 2021. It was her position he continued to receive the \\nsame or similar monies but received it in cash to show a reduced income. This was not established \\nthrough any evidence before the Court.  \\n[29] \\nIf the Court does not find the Applicant was earning additional income, the Respondent \\nargued the Applicant was deliberately underemployed and there are other positions in the industry \\nwhere higher salaries are paid. The Respondent challenged the timing of the decrease in his salary \\nand suggested it was a month after she filed her answer and sought spousal support. The Applicant \\nrepeated his explanation regarding the company’s decision to assign one driver to the Montreal-\\nToronto route and how it impacted his pay.  \\n[30] \\nThe Applicant agreed some truck drivers have a higher income but drive longer trips. Every \\ntrucking company is different, and rates of pay may be affected by hours, mileage, loads, heavy \\nlifting, offloading, and onloading. The allegation of the Respondent that some drivers make \\n$70,000/year is possible if the driver travels longer routes and/or to the United States.  \\n[31] \\nThe Applicant was terminated from his position with RTI in late December 2022/January \\n2023. He was unemployed for four months and began his new employment the end of April 2023. \\nHe currently earns approximately $23/hour and the range of salary driving in Toronto is $17/hr to \\n$23/hr. \\n[32] \\nLastly, the Respondent suggested the Applicant owned shares in a car-wash company. She \\nagreed that other than overhearing a conversation where the Applicant seemed to give directions \\nto the other party, she had no evidence to prove this allegation.  \\nChild Support \\n[33] \\nThere is no dispute that the Applicant is required to pay table child support. The quantum \\nis determinative by the Applicant’s income. \\n[34] \\nThe Applicant has paid child support since separation but missed October 2019 and \\nFebruary 2023. The Applicant paid $500/month from November 2019 to September 2021. The \\nApplicant reduced his child support payments to $400 from that date to March 2022. Commencing \\nApril 2022, $450 child support has been paid each month with the exception noted above. \\nSection 7 Expenses \\n[35] \\nThe Applicant testified he was not opposed to some of the extra-curricular activities B.S.A. \\nwas enrolled in but he was concerned about his ability to pay. He explained the Respondent had \\nenrolled B.S.A. in language classes and he did not understand why they had not explored other \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\noptions or classes that were less money. The Applicant advised he knew someone who could teach \\nB.S.A. at a much lesser cost. The Applicant expressed the need for the Respondent to consider his \\nincome and financial ability to pay. \\n[36] \\nThe Applicant also testified that if he disagrees with an activity, whether it is beneficial to \\nB.S.A. or not, he will not pay or contribute to that expense.  \\n[37] \\nThe Applicant was questioned whether he contributed to any section 7 expenses to date. \\nHe explained he is prepared to contribute but wants to know what the true expense is and whether \\nthe Respondent received any subsidies or other coverage before apportioning the expense.  \\n[38] \\nLastly, the Applicant explained the difficulties created when the Respondent provides him \\nwith copies of all receipts only once a year. He testified it would be easier for him to budget \\nproperly if the Respondent provide the receipts monthly, or he pay a monthly stipend towards the \\ns.7 expenses. Further, he would like to know details of the expenses in advance and have some \\ninput into what educational programs the child is registered. The Applicant testified s.7 expenses \\nshould be apportioned after considering the parties’ incomes and the child support payable. \\n[39] \\nThe Respondent testified she would like the s.7 expenses to be shared on a 50/50 basis \\nirrespective of income. Further, if she returns to school, that the shared expenses be proportioned \\n70/30 in her favour.  \\n[40] \\nThe Respondent, Ms. Mumtaz, expressed her intention to continue to register B.S.A. for \\nactivities and classes that are good for her health and encourage her interaction with other children. \\nShe will ensure the Applicant is informed of all activities and will provide him with a schedule of \\nthe child’s weekly activities. She explained registrations open early in the morning online and fill \\nup quickly. She does not have time to contact the Applicant and wait for his response or the spot \\nwill be filled.   \\n[41] \\nThe Respondent filed receipts for s.7 expenses she is seeking shared coverage for 2023. \\nThese receipts are for prescription glasses, eye exams, dental care, and skating lessons. \\n[42] \\nThe Respondent advised B.S.A. is not currently enrolled in aftercare because she was \\nbullied and unhappy. The Respondent picks her up and cares for her afterschool but still must \\nwork. The fact B.S.A. is not in aftercare is a benefit to the Applicant permitting him to save funds. \\nShe testified if B.S.A. was in aftercare, the Applicant would be responsible for 50% of the cost. It \\nis her position that because she is saving the Applicant from contributing to aftercare, she will \\nenroll B.S.A. in whatever programs she wants and will not seek his permission or input. Her \\njustification is the cost of these extracurricular activities are far less than aftercare and the \\nApplicant should be grateful he is saved from that s.7 expense. \\n[43] \\nThe Respondent testified B.S.A. attends martial arts classes twice a week, basketball, \\nswimming, and skating. Many of the classes were subsidized and the only activity that incurred a \\ncost in 2023 was $50 for the fall skating session. B.SA. is also enrolled in educational classes \\nprovided online. She attends 4 x 30-minute sessions a week. The Respondent pays for these classes \\ndirectly thru paypal or etransfer. \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\nSpousal Support \\n[44] \\nThe Respondent seeks spousal support from the date of separation to April 2022 when she \\ncompleted her studies. She testified regarding her financial circumstances and attendance at school \\nthroughout this period. Documents were filed to support her enrollment at Centennial College, \\ngrants and bursaries received, pay stubs, banking records, and notices of assessment.  \\n[45] \\nThroughout her studies, the Respondent received student grants from the Ontario Student \\nAssistance Program, bursaries, and government rebates. Further, she was in receipt of all tax \\nbenefits including the child tax credit. \\n[46] \\nThe Applicant questioned the Respondent on deposits to her account in 2019 of \\napproximately $37,000. He asked why these funds were not declared on her taxes. The Respondent \\nexplained those funds were non-taxable and therefore were not included as income for tax \\npurposes.  \\n[47] \\nIn addition to the funds above, the Respondent agreed she received $8400 from the \\nApplicant in 2019. She did not claim this as spousal support but to cover the rent while the parties \\nlived apart. In total, the Applicant received $45,678.79 that year - none of which was taxed. \\nTravel \\n[48] \\nThe Applicant testified both parties should be permitted to travel with B.S.A. providing a \\nminimum of twenty (20) days notice is given in advance. Neither party should withhold their \\nconsent unreasonably. The Applicant testified that neither party should be permitted to travel to \\ncountries not part of the Hague Convention.  \\n[49] \\nHe felt it was unfair the Respondent was permitted to travel outside Canada with B.S.A. \\nand he is not permitted to take her on a trip. He testified he is not a criminal and should be allowed \\nto travel with her. He believes when the Respondent travels with B.S.A. for a lengthy period, it \\ncreates a wider space between him and B.S.A. \\n[50] \\nThe Applicant discussed the Respondent’s earlier motions requesting permission to travel. \\nThe first one was denied because the Respondent wanted to travel with B.S.A. to Turkey and Iran. \\nTurkey had just suffered a catastrophic earthquake and Iran is not a party to the Hague Convention. \\nFurther, the issue regarding decision making and parenting had not been decided. Also, the \\nApplicant was given little to no notice of the motion and was out of the country at the time the \\nmotion was filed, and the trial was upcoming. \\n[51] \\nThe Applicant explained he did not consent to her second request to travel in July in \\nadvance of her filing a motion as it went into his spam folder, and he did not see it until two days \\nbefore the motion was scheduled. Rather than contact her, he waited for court. \\n[52] \\nThe Applicant believes he should be entitled to the same rights as the Respondent regarding \\ntravel with B.S.A. \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\n[53] \\nThe Respondent questioned the Applicant regarding time spent with B.S.A. He agreed that \\nB.S.A. has never spent a night apart from the Respondent, however, he argued he should be \\npermitted overnights with her.  \\n[54] \\nThe Applicant was asked about occasions when he cancelled parenting time with B.S.A., \\nfailed to request make-up time after she travelled with the Respondent in 2023, did not request \\nadditional time during the week when he was unemployed, and did not offer to provide after school \\nsupervision of B.S.A. when not working. The Respondent sought to demonstrate the Applicant has \\nnot developed a strong enough relationship to travel with B.S.A. for overnight periods at this time. \\n[55] \\nThe Respondent testified she has primary residence and decision-making responsibility \\nregarding the health, education, and the well-being of the child and therefore should be permitted \\nto travel outside Canada without the permission of the Applicant. Further, there should be no \\nrestrictions on where she can travel with B.S.A. including countries that are not signatories to the \\nHague convention.  \\n[56] \\nThe Respondent testified about the benefits to B.S.A. if she is permitted to travel and see \\nother countries. The Respondent banked her vacation time to permit an extended trip last summer \\nthat allowed B.S.A. to immerse herself in the culture and speak French while they were in Paris \\nlast summer. The Respondent also wants to take B.S.A. to Iran to see her family. \\n[57] \\nThe Respondent explained B.S.A.’s disappointment when the Court dismissed her motion \\nto permit her to travel to Turkey and Iran with B.S.A. She acknowledged telling the child it was \\nher father’s fault they were not permitted to travel. This resulted in B.S.A. refusing to see the \\nApplicant and created resentment towards him.  \\n[58] \\nThe Respondent is prepared to inform the Applicant in advance of any travel arrangements \\nincluding providing him with a complete itinerary with addresses. She expressed frustration with \\nthe Applicant when she travelled with B.S.A. last summer. She explained when the Applicant \\ntravels, he does not contact or seek to speak with B.S.A. However, when they were away, the \\nApplicant insisted on calling without notice and without preapproved or agreed upon times and \\ndemanded to speak with B.S.A. On some occasions, it was not convenient or possible. At no time \\nhas the Applicant sought make-up time for occasions when he missed parenting time due to his \\ntravel or when B.S.A. travelled with the Respondent. \\nPick Ups/Drop Offs \\n[59] \\nThe Applicant testified about the current pickup/drop-off arrangements. He is required to \\nattend the 16th floor of the Respondent’s apartment building. Her apartment is approximately 25 \\nmeters form the elevator. The Applicant attends on the floor and the child exits the apartment and \\ngoes to her father and calls verbally to her mother to confirm she is safe. The Respondent remains \\nin the apartment with the door locked. \\n[60] \\nThe Respondent claims their daughter gets stressed and upset when her parents are in the \\nsame room or vicinity. B.S.A. has expressed concerns and becomes apprehensive when both \\nparents are scheduled or agree to attend the same events. The Respondent testified she would be \\nopen to exchanges of parenting time taking place at a public restaurant or common place. The \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nRespondent is not agreeable for drop offs and pick ups occurring in the lobby due to the presence \\nof the Afghan community in her building. \\n[61] \\nBoth parties expressed a willingness to find a mutually agreeable public place for \\nexchanges, either a McDonalds or community center.  \\nOther Witnesses \\n[62] \\nDavoud Tawakol testified he has known the Applicant since 2009 when the Applicant \\narrived in Canada. He described his observations of the Applicant’s relationship with B.S.A. He \\nhas seen the two laughing with each other and seem very close when together. The witness did not \\nwork with the Applicant and was not in a position to comment on his income. He testified that the \\nApplicant used to drive long distance and attend in the US but that was more than four years ago.  \\n[63] \\nAhmad Jami testified that he met the Applicant through family and mutual friends in 2019 \\nor 2020 and believed it was after the parties separated as he has never met the Respondent. During \\ntheir friendship, they usually meet three to four times a week to exercise, play sports, or cook \\ntogether. He understood the Applicant to work in the Toronto area but was aware the Applicant \\nhad gone to Montreal on occasion.  \\n[64] \\nAhmad Nawid Haqyar testified he has known the Applicant for a few years. During this \\ntime, they would often get together approximately 3 – 4 times a week. Often, they would meet \\nafter Mr. Haqyar gets off work around 6 p.m. but on occasion they have met earlier. The two would \\ngo for walks or play volleyball together.  \\n[65] \\nThe Applicant asked all three witnesses if they had ever seen him receive cash payments \\nfor his work. All three denied any knowledge of the Applicant being paid in cash. None of the \\nwitnesses are truck drivers, nor do they work for the same employer or with the Applicant. On the \\nissues I must decide, there evidence has little bearing.   \\nAnalysis \\nChild Support \\n[66] \\nThe Applicant has an obligation to disclose all relevant evidence to enable the Respondent \\nand the Court to have an accurate and complete picture of his income for support purposes. \\n[67] \\nHaving reviewed the evidence before me, including the Applicant’s financial documents, \\nlogbooks, and testimony, I am satisfied that deposits and withdrawals into and from the \\nApplicant’s accounts accord with his evidence. Like the Respondent, the Applicant moved funds \\nback and forth between accounts and more recently to his line of credit. The funds transferred in \\nor out of accounts was easily reconciled when compared to other bank statements and/or credit \\nlines. The Respondent testified he received no additional monies during his employment except \\nthe funds reflected in his banking statements and there is no evidence to the contrary. \\n[68] \\nThe Respondent requested that the Applicant’s income should be imputed to $70,000 per \\nannum. The issue of imputation of income was not included in the Respondent’s pleadings. She \\nwas directed to bring a motion to amend her pleadings if she wished to pursue this claim. There \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\nwas no evidence before the Court to indicate her pleadings were amended and I have declined to \\nconsider this claim.  \\n[69] \\nIn the event I erred in not considering this issue, I summarized the evidence on this point, \\nand am still not satisfied that income should be imputed to the Applicant. The onus is on the \\nRespondent to establish the grounds for this request.1 I cannot arbitrarily select an amount to \\nimpute income. There must be a basis for attributing $70,000 or any other amount to the Applicant \\ngrounded in the evidence. No evidence was proffered to establish the Applicant made this amount \\nin any years. Nor was it proven that he received cash payments or had other income. Further, there \\nwas an insufficient evidentiary basis to find that the Applicant was underemployed or intentionally \\nunemployed. I am satisfied on the Applicant’s evidence regarding his employment history. \\n[70] \\nTo determine table child support, I must first make a finding of the Applicant father’s \\nincome in each of the years of 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. I reviewed all bank statements, \\nfinancial statements, and materials introduced at trial. I totalled the deposits into the Applicant’s \\nbusiness and/or personal accounts from the following employers, 2699047 Ontario Inc., Dhruv \\nTransport Inc., and the more recent mobile deposits in 2023. In addition, I included CERB \\npayments the Applicant received in 2020. I did not include as income monies that were transferred \\nbetween accounts to cover shortfalls, bill payments, or monies that originated from the Applicant’s \\ncredit line or funds that were loaned to the Applicant from his two friends. This process was \\ncompleted for each of the above years. I acknowledge 2019 and 2023 are not an accurate \\ncalculation as I do not have full banking records for 2019, nor was evidence before the court of \\nother potential income received in each of those two years.2 \\n[71] \\nIn 2019, I totalled the monies deposited in the Applicant’s business account between May \\nand December ($41,267.70), reviewed his business and personal notice of assessments for 2019 to \\n2022, and estimated an annual income of $55,000 to determine table child support.3 I have \\nconcluded table child support for October to December 2019, is $507.4 \\n[72] \\nThe Applicant’s income for 2020 was $63,402.66 which included receipt of the CERB for \\na four-month period between April to July ($8000). Table child support for 2020 is $588.85. \\n[73] \\nThe Applicant’s income for 2021 was $54397.32. He explained his income decreased due \\nto changes in job assignments. One driver was assigned the Toronto to Montreal route, and he was \\nnot that driver. Instead, he was tasked with driving locally and received a weekly salary \\nirrespective of the number of hours he drove. The Applicant relied on his bank statements and \\nworklogs to confirm his route, hours, and days worked. Table child support for 2021 is $501.66. \\n                                            \\n1 Homsi v. Zaya, 2009 Carswell Ont 2068 (C.A.), add’l reasons 2009 Carswell Ont 3112 (C.A.); Drygala v. Pauli, \\n2002 Carswell Ont 3228 (C.A.), add’l reasons 2003 Carswell Ont 7 (C.A.); McNeil v Dunne, 2019 ONSC 2528. \\n2 The Applicant’s notice of assessments for his business and personal tax returns were filed with the court but the \\nincome tax returns were not. Therefore, to determine income that did not include business expense write-offs, I \\nsimply added all employment pay deposited to his accounts. \\n3 The Applicant’s corporate tax notice of assessment reflected an annual income of $38,312.09. His bank records \\nreflect deposits of $41,267.70. The Applicant’s full income tax returns were not evidence before the court, and I was \\nunable to determine what amounts were deducted as expenses and therefore estimated compared to other years.  \\n4 The table amount of child support payable in 2019 may be subject to adjustment dependent on the Applicant’s total \\nincome for that year. This information was not before me at trial and may affect the arrears calculated. \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\n[74] \\nThe Applicant received a slight increase in his weekly salary in 2022, however, his annual \\nincome was lower than 2021 due to the change in his job assignments in August 2021. His annual \\nincome for 2022 was $44,296. From the banking statements, the Applicant only worked one week \\nin December. It appears the Applicant did not receive vacation pay and was only paid for the weeks \\nhe was in attendance. Table child support for 2022 is $409.61.  \\n[75] \\nThe Applicant lost his job in January 2023 and was unemployed until April 2023. His bank \\nstatements reveal he earned $18,855.76 between May to August and an additional $1443.00 in \\nApril. I am unable to determine his final income for 2023 but if his income for the balance of the \\nyear is consistent with the four months of bank statements filed with the Court, it would be \\napproximately $40,000. Table child support on this amount is $359 and is subject to change \\ndependent on the Applicant’s income for the balance of the year and any other income including \\nEmployment Insurance collected for the period he was unemployed.  \\n[76] \\nTo simplify calculations of any arrears owing, I rounded up the monthly table amounts as \\nfollows: 2019 - $507; 2020 - $589; 2021 - $502; 2022 - $410; and 2023 – $359.  \\n[77] \\nBased on the above calculations, the Applicant should have paid a total of $23,841. Based \\non the Respondent’s calculations, the Applicant has paid a total of $21,450 inclusive to the end of \\nSeptember 2023. Assuming the Applicant continued to pay $450 for the period between October \\nto December 2023 the total amount is $22,8005 leaving arrears of $1041.  \\n[78] \\nThe Applicant missed paying child support for the months of October 2019 and February \\n2023. The Applicant did pay the Respondent $1400 in October 2019. I found the Respondent was \\nnot entitled to spousal support and therefore have applied $500 from this amount towards the \\narrears. Therefore, arrears owing is $541.6 \\n[79] \\nThe above amount may be subject to adjustment upon the Applicant providing the \\nRespondent with his full business bank account statements, income tax returns, and notices of \\nassessment for 2023. The amount owing may be more dependent on the Applicant’s annual income \\nfor 2023.  \\nSection 7 Expenses \\n[80] \\nSection 7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines governs “special or extraordinary” \\nexpenses. It permits a court to order an additional amount payable above table child support. A \\ncourt must consider the necessity of the expense in relation to the child’s best interests and the \\nreasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the spouses. Special or extraordinary \\nexpenses are:  \\na. Child care expenses incurred as a result of employment, illness, disability, or \\neducation or training for employment of the spouse who has the majority of \\nparenting time; \\n                                            \\n5 This amount does not include the missing payment for February 2023. \\n6 As indicated above, any arrears are subject to the Applicant’s income for 2023. \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\nb. That portion of the medical and dental insurance premiums attributable to the child; \\nc. Health related expenses, including orthodontic treatment, professional counselling \\nprovided by a psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist, or any other person, \\nphysiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and prescription drugs, \\nhearing aids, glasses and contact lenses; \\nd. Extraordinary expenses for primary or secondary school education or for any other \\neducational programs that meet the child’s particular needs; \\ne. Expenses for post-secondary education; and  \\nf. Extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities. \\n[81] \\nSection 7 requires a Court to determine the necessity and reasonableness of a claimed \\nexpense. It must consider if the expense is necessary in relation to the child’s best interests and \\nreasonable in relation to the means of the spouses. For paragraphs d and f above, the expense must \\nbe “extraordinary” not the activity.  \\n[82] \\nSection 7(2) provides that these expenses are shared by the parents in proportion to their \\nrespective incomes. \\n[83] \\nThe Respondent seeks reimbursement from the Applicant for medical and dental expenses \\nthat exceed or are not covered by her health benefits. The Respondent submitted receipts for three \\npairs of eyeglasses, eye examinations, and dental care received in 2023. The Respondent testified \\nB.S.A. is now added to her benefits and is entitled to coverage for dental and healthcare. However, \\nthere was no evidence when she was added. To determine the Applicant’s share in these expenses, \\nthe Respondent must provide proof of her insurance coverage and the effective date. If B.S.A. was \\nadded to her mother’s benefits before these expenses were incurred, the Respondent must also \\nprovide a copy of the explanation of benefits to confirm what the insurer paid. Any balance \\nremaining can then be divided proportionate to the parties’ incomes. I am unable to determine what \\nif anything is owed without fulsome information of the Applicant’s income for 2023 and whether \\nthe Respondent received any reimbursement from her benefit provider. The parties must exchange \\nthis information to determine what the Applicant may owe.  \\n[84] \\nThe Respondent enrolled B.S.A. in numerous extracurricular activities. Many of these \\nprograms were available at little or no cost to the Respondent, except skating and any necessary \\nequipment. Section 7 is designed not to include everyday extracurricular activities as those are \\nexpected to be covered by table child support. Courts have held swimming lessons, soccer, \\nbasketball, and martial arts, are not extraordinary expenses.7 If, however, B.S.A. was to compete \\nin one or more of these sports and demonstrated a talent to become a professional, she may require \\nadditional training and instruction which could be an extraordinary expense.  \\n[85] \\nThe law does not support the Applicant’s position that he will only contribute to expenses \\nhe has approved or knows about in advance. Whether he approves or disagrees with a section 7 \\n                                            \\n7 Zigiris v Foustanellas, 2016 ONSC 7528, McAdam Estate v McAdam [2006] O.J. 694, Boisvert v Boisvert, [2007] \\nO.J. No. 2555. \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\nexpense is not the test. However, the programs B.S.A. has been registered for to date, do not fall \\nunder the rubric of “extraordinary expenses”. \\n[86] \\nSection 7 includes post-secondary education as a special or extraordinary expense. In \\npreparation for this expenditure, the Respondent opened a Registered Education Savings Plan \\n(“RESP”) for B.S.A. She requested the Applicant father be ordered to contribute $1200 a year to \\nthis plan. The Respondent testified she contributes $50/month. Given the disparity of the incomes \\nof the parties, I decline to make an order for the Applicant father to contribute to the RESP. \\nHowever, this is a section 7 expense, and the Applicant will be required to contribute to these \\nexpenses at the appropriate time. \\n[87] \\nThe Respondent explained that B.S.A. will likely require braces in the future. This is also \\nan expense contemplated by section 7 and the Applicant will be required to contribute to these \\nexpenses proportionate to the parties’ incomes after any benefits or coverage by dental plans. \\n[88] \\nThe Court understands the concerns expressed by the Applicant regarding receiving all \\nreceipts once per year. Therefore, the Respondent shall provide copies of any receipts for section \\n7 expenses to the Applicant within thirty (30) days of the expense, together with proof of any \\nsubsidies, coverage, and/or explanation of benefits. \\nSpousal Support \\n[89] \\nThe Divorce Act sets out the objectives of spousal support and recognizes the economic \\nadvantages and disadvantages arising from a marriage and its breakdown, and the need to promote \\nfinancial self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable amount of time. \\n[90] \\nThe purpose behind needs-based support is for families to support themselves. If a spouse \\ncannot work or does not have enough income or assets to support themselves, a court will order \\nspousal support. Need is not limited to the ability to pay for necessities of life but also looks to the \\nstandard of living during the relationship. \\n[91] \\nIt is clear from the evidence the Respondent mother has been successful in obtaining \\nfinancial self-sufficiency. She had been attending school prior to the marriage breakdown and \\ncontinued her education after separation. The Respondent is not seeking spousal support moving \\nforward but argued she was entitled to spousal support from the day of separation until she \\ngraduated from her program.  \\n[92] \\nA claim for spousal support was not made until July 16, 2021, almost two years after the \\nparties separated. This date would be important to determine whether retroactive spousal support \\nis payable. Retroactive spousal support refers to the period between the date of separation and \\nwhen the claim was made. It is not support that may be owing after the Application is made. \\n[93] \\nBoth parties testified and produced documents to demonstrate or confirm their respective \\nincomes and financial circumstances. I have no reason to doubt the sincerity and truthfulness of \\neither party regarding their incomes. Determining each party’s income or access to funds was \\neasily done through an examination of their financial documents. \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\n[94] \\nThe Respondent provided calculations of what she believed she was entitled to for 2019, \\n2020, and 2021, based on an imputed income of $70,000 to the Applicant. She calculated her \\nincome as $0, 17,607, and 30,706, for the respective years. The Respondent did not include any \\nmonies she received from OSAP, bursaries, or scholarships. Although these funds are not taxable, \\nit is still considered income for purposes of determining support. \\n[95] \\nOn the date of separation, the Respondent was attending Centennial College in the second \\nyear of a three-year program. She had applied for and received education grants and bursaries. \\nThese funds were not considered taxable income and therefore do not appear at line 150 of her \\nnotice of assessments. She testified she had been responsible for the household expenses since \\n2018 and the Applicant did not contribute except for six months in 2019 where he gave her \\n$1400/month for a total of $8400. \\n[96] \\nThe Respondent submitted if the Court found she was entitled to spousal support it should \\nbe imposed at the low end. The Respondent relied on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines \\nfor the appropriate amount. I am unable to rely on the calculations submitted by the Respondent. \\nI have found the Applicant’s income to be less than what the Respondent relied upon and the \\nRespondent’s income to be much higher. \\n[97] \\nHaving examined the Respondent’s bank account statements, a total of $45,678.79 was \\ndeposited to her chequing account in 2019. This amount does not include transfers from her savings \\naccount. The Respondent received $19,386 in OSAP grants. A further $4711 was deposited thru \\nATM machines into her chequing account that I was unable to source where the monies originated. \\nIn addition, $8400 was received from the Applicant for rent, and $1400 from interbranch deposits \\nbetween January to March. These funds alone total more than $32,000 none of which was taxed. \\nThe $32,000 does not include monthly child tax credits of $658.24 or other credits the Respondent \\nreceived. These additional deposits totalled $10,581.29. I did not include the child support \\npayments of $1000 for the months of November and December in these calculations. \\n[98] \\nFor the years 2020 to 2022, relying on the Respondent’s taxable income on her notice of \\nassessments and other non-taxable sources of income, she is not entitled to spousal support.  \\nTravel with Child \\n[99] \\nThe parties agreed on March 31, 2023, the Respondent has primary residence and decision-\\nmaking responsibility regarding the health, education, and the well-being of the child, following \\nthe recommendations of medical, professionals, school staff, and considering the best interests of \\nthe child. She shall advise the father before making any decision on major issues pertaining to the \\nchild’s health or education or well-being and shall consider his opinions on such issues.  \\n[100] The agreement permits the father to increase his time with B.S.A. and should eventually \\ninclude or lead to overnight parenting time. This has not happened yet. The father expressed his \\ndesire to have more time with B.S.A. throughout the trial and asked the Court to order more \\nparenting time. \\n[101] Unfortunately, contrary to the Applicant’s testimony and requests, he has taken very little \\naction to support his words. Justice Myers commented “the father is a truck driver. He has not been \\nable to arrange his work with sufficient flexibility to exercise his mid-week time regularly, if at \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\nall.” It is unclear if Justice Myers was aware the Applicant travelled in January and was \\nunemployed upon his return until the end of April. There was no evidence before me of what steps \\nthe Applicant took to spend more time with B.S.A. during that time. This was an opportunity for \\nhim to pick her up from school, assist with homework, cook meals, and provide aftercare while \\nthe Respondent finished work. Further, there was no evidence presented about any efforts the \\nApplicant has made to exercise the additional parenting time he was entitled to due to the \\nRespondent’s travel with the child last summer. \\n[102] Before the Applicant can travel with his daughter, he needs to forge a stronger relationship \\nwith her. The child has never spent a single night away from the Respondent and therefore, it is \\nnot in the best interests of the child to suddenly be removed from her mother and spend an extended \\ntime travelling with her father prior to building a foundation and base ahead of any travel with the \\nApplicant. This includes exercising parenting time consistently and insisting on any make-up time. \\nAs time progresses, the Applicant should be entitled to overnight parenting time with B.S.A. in \\nanticipation of travel together. The Applicant needs to demonstrate how he will care for a child \\nwho is in is care for 24 hours a day for several days and possibly weeks without the presence of \\nthe Respondent.  \\n[103] Therefore, the Applicant may only travel with the child outside Ontario with the written \\nconsent of the Respondent who holds the primary residence and the decision-making rights of the \\nchild.  \\n[104] The Respondent mother would like to travel with the child without restrictions or consent \\nof the Applicant father, including countries not signatories to the Hague Convention on Child \\nAbduction. The Applicant is opposed.  \\n[105] The Respondent mother brought two separate motions to travel in advance of the trial date. \\nThe first was not granted, the second was. Justice Myers heard both motions and distinguished the \\ncircumstances before him on each of the motions. I echo Justice Myers’ comments in the July 20, \\n2023, endorsement, “Travel is generally in the best interests of children. It gives them education, \\nfun, excitement, and memories that last a lifetime”. \\n[106] I have determined the Respondent may obtain and retain government documents and \\npassports for the child. The Respondent shall provide the Applicant with a photocopy of any \\ngovernment document(s) obtained for the child. \\n[107] Providing B.S.A. is under the age of sixteen, neither party shall travel with her to countries \\nthat are not signatories to the Hague Convention without written consent from the other party. \\nWhere consent is provided, the party travelling shall provide full details of the travel which shall \\ninclude destinations, contact phone numbers, and addresses for the duration of the trip at least \\nfourteen (14) days in advance. \\n[108] The Respondent does not require the consent of the Applicant to travel with the child to \\ncountries that are signatories to the Hague Convention. If B.S.A. is under the age of sixteen, the \\nRespondent shall provide the Applicant with a minimum of thirty (30) days advance notice of any \\ntravel outside of Canada. She is not required to provide the Applicant with a full itinerary as set \\nout above for travel to non-signatory countries. \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1801 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\nLocation of Pick Ups/Drop Offs \\n[109] This last issue seemed to resolve itself during the testimony of the parties at trial. The \\nRespondent testified she was prepared to meet the Applicant at a public venue such as a local \\ncommunity centre for the purpose of exchanging parenting time of B.S.A. \\n[110] This was a very reasonable position for everyone. As such, I will not interfere or impose a \\nlocation for the exchanges of parenting time for B.S.A. but will order that it not take place on the \\n16th floor of the Respondent’s apartment complex unless agreed to in advance in writing by both \\nparties.  \\nCosts: \\n[111] Costs are not ordered. Both parties are self-represented and each had a degree of success \\nat trial.  \\nConclusion \\n[112] As a result of my findings of fact and application of the law set out below, I make the \\nfollowing orders: \\nChild Support \\na. Ms. Mumtaz’s request to impute income to Mr. Shir Ahmad is dismissed. \\nb. Mr. Shir Ahmad is ordered to pay child support arrears of $541 within six months \\nof this Order. \\nc. Mr. Shir Ahmad shall pay to Ms. Mumtaz $359 each month commencing April 1, \\n2024, for Table Child Support for B.S.A. born January 21, 2015. \\nd. Mr. Shir Ahmad shall provide a copy of his personal and corporate income tax \\nreturns and Notices of Assessment each year on an ongoing basis by June 30 of the \\nfollowing year until child support is no longer payable. i.e. Mr. Shir Ahmad shall \\nprovide copies of this 2023 personal and corporate income tax returns and Notices \\nof Assessment by June 30, 2024.

The relationship began while Mr. Hamelin was serving a \\nlong term supervision order in a community correctional centre in Kingston pursuant to a residency \\ncondition, under the supervision of his parole supervisor, Serge Hebert. The offences occurred \\nwithin 9 months following the expiration of the long term supervision order, and continued from \\nNovember 2019 into March 2020. \\nAgreed Statement of Fact \\n[4] \\n \\nAn agreed statement of fact was filed to support the guilty pleas and convictions. \\n[5] \\n \\nMr. Hamelin and HN began dating in 2018 while he was subject to a residency \\ncondition under his long term supervision order. He eventually resided with her and her two \\nchildren, ages 11 and 7 years. \\n[6] \\n \\nHN terminated the relationship on October 27, 2019. He continued to stay at her \\nresidence until November 1, 2019. On October 31, 2019, Mr. Hamelin began communicating with \\nHN by text and other electronic devices repeatedly, knowing that she did not want to have any \\ncommunication whatsoever with him. She discovered that he had damaged her laptop beyond \\nrepair. Over the next 2 weeks, he sent her hundreds of emails and called her repeatedly. He \\ncommunicated with her employer, a local public school board, alleging that she was downloading \\nchild pornography and engaging in sex acts with several men. Her employer contacted the \\nKingston police to report having received a series of concerning emails alleging grave misconduct \\non the part of HN rendering her unfit to work with children. She was suspended from her work, \\nwhile the school investigated the allegations. He sent a similar email to the dance troupe where \\nshe was a dance coordinator and instructor. Despite being cautioned by the police, Mr. Hamelin \\npersisted in communicating or in attempting to communicate with HN. She received messages \\nfrom him on almost a daily basis throughout December 2019. On December 24, 2019, there was a \\nbreak-in at her home and her MacBook was stolen. He messaged her about that. \\n[7] \\n \\nWhen Mr. Hamelin was arrested, on December 27, 2019, he was found in \\npossession of her MacBook laptop. He has been held in custody without bail since his arrest. \\nAlthough prohibited by court order from communicating with HN, he continued to do so although \\nhe was in jail. Between February 20, 2020 and March 6, 2020, he left 16 voicemail messages for \\nher. The content is disturbing, vile, disgusting and highly disrespectful. \\n[8] \\n \\nHe told Dr. Gray that his intention was to cause HN to feel hurt in the same way \\nthat she had caused him to feel hurt. \\nOrder for Assessment \\n[9] \\n \\nFollowing the convictions before me, upon Crown application, on April 13, 2023, \\nfor the reasons given, I ordered an assessment pursuant to section 752.1 under the dangerous \\noffender legislation. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\n[10] \\n \\nDr. Gray performed the assessment and his report, dated May 9, 2023 is filed in \\nExhibit 1. \\nConsent of the Attorney General \\n[11] \\n \\nThe Crown has filed the consent of the Attorney General to these proceedings. \\nThe Issues \\n[12] \\n \\nThe Crown seeks to have Mr. Hamelin found to be a dangerous offender under \\nsection 753(1) and, if so, sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, under section 753(4)(a). \\n[13] \\n \\nSubsection 4.1 states that the court shall impose a sentence of detention in a \\npenitentiary for an indeterminate period unless it is satisfied by the evidence adduced during the \\nhearing of the application that there is a reasonable expectation that a lesser measure under \\nparagraphs (4)(b) or (c) will adequately protect the public against the commission by the offender \\nof a serious personal injury offence. \\n[14] \\n \\nMr. Hamelin submits that because of the evidence of treatment and programming \\nthat he requires having not been offered to him yet but available, particularly within a federal \\npenitentiary, the strict close supervision available if subject to a LTSO and the strict limiting \\nconditions that he can be subjected to by the Parole Board of Canada, firstly, that the Crown has \\nnot proven beyond a reasonable doubt a criterion for designation as a dangerous offender, namely, \\n“a likelihood of inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, through failure in the \\nfuture to restrain his or his behaviour”, and secondly, alternatively, if he is found to be a dangerous \\noffender, he should be sentenced to a jail term which is the equivalent of in excess of a 10 year \\npenitentiary sentence, less presentence custody credit, followed by a long term supervision order \\nof 7 to 10 years.  \\nThe Evidence on the Application \\n[15] \\n \\nThe evidence on the Application consisted of materials filed by the Crown which \\nincluded the consent of the Attorney General, a transcript of the proceedings before me including \\nthe Agreed Statement of Fact, Mr. Hamelin’s criminal record, the victim impact statements of his \\ntwo most recent victims, transcripts of proceedings with respect to his previous convictions and \\nsentencings, previous psychological and psychiatric assessments, previous correctional plans, CSC \\nassessments for decision and Parole Board decisions. \\n[16] \\n \\nThe Crown called viva voce evidence of Dr. Gray, forensic psychiatrist, Stephen \\nEros, CSC program manager and facilitator, Jennifer Howie, CSC parole officer, supervisor and \\nActing Regional Director, and Karen Thomson, Regional Manager of Conditional Release \\nPrograms for the Parole Board of Canada. \\nVictim Impact Statement of HN (filed on consent) \\n[17] \\n \\nHN described the horrendous and psychologically damaging emotional impact that \\nMr. Hamelin’s crimes had on her and her family. He caused her to experience incessant stress, \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nanxiety, worry, abuse and humiliation in all aspects of her life. She described his repulsive and \\nabusive communications as emotional torture which escalated throughout the months following \\nher termination of the relationship with him. She felt that he was extremely manipulative and \\nabsolutely relentless in his goal to tear her down, ruin her reputation and blame her for his \\nunfortunate life situation. The communications to her employer and dance troupe left her ashamed \\nand disgraced and resulted in her being placed on administrative leave from her teaching position \\nand being barred from attending at the school or communicating with any of her colleagues or \\nstudents while she was investigated by the school board. There were abusive social media posts \\nincluding on Facebook and the school’s Twitter account as well as posters displayed in the \\nneighbourhood around the school making grotesque false accusations about her. These posts \\ncontinue to be seen on Google. He terrorized her and her family during the Christmas season of \\n2019. They could not be at home together or wake up on Christmas morning as a family. \\n[18] \\n \\nShe had to pay for a large cell phone bill, in the order of $6000, which he had \\nincurred, and she had to replace the computer which he had destroyed in the sum of approximately \\n$1350. \\n[19] \\n \\nHis behaviour continued for over four months, including while he was in jail and \\nsubject to a non-communication order. \\n[20] \\n \\nClearly and quite reasonably and expectedly, he caused her, and his actions were \\nlikely to cause her, to experience severe psychological injury that has and will no doubt continue \\nto haunt her. \\nThe Offender \\n[21] \\n \\nThe various courts who have sentenced Mr. Hamelin, the professionals who have \\nattempted to treat Mr. Hamelin previously and the CSC and parole board decisions have reviewed \\nhis personal circumstances. \\n[22] \\n \\nThe PSR dated August 16, 2011, reported that he denied anger management issues. \\n[23] \\n \\nHe minimized the threat he posed to others.  He portrayed himself as the victim.  \\nHe had no insight into his abusive behaviour and he did not accept responsibility.   \\n[24] \\n \\nHis mother and aunt blocked his calls.  As his father said, he uses people to the \\npoint that they burnout.  His parents stated that his offending would happen again.  It did, AB and \\nHN. \\n[25] \\n \\nThe PSR reported that Mr. Hamelin was not interested in attending counselling. \\n[26] \\n \\nJustice Meijers referred to Mr. Hamelin’s personal circumstances in his decision of \\nNovember 2014, which imposed a long term supervision order. (R. v. Hamelin, [2014] O.J. No. \\n6663 (OCJ)). \\n[27] \\n \\nMost recently, Justice Clark in his decision of July 18, 2018, found in Ex.6, stated \\nin part, \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n“Given the chronology, it is patently clear that Mr. Hamelin has not participated \\nin or really even started any rehabilitative programming in the community, as set \\nout in the various terms of the Long-Term Supervision Order. \\nHis criminal record starts in 2002.  I will not articulate the various entries as they \\nare the subject of the materials provided to the Court.  It demonstrates, however, a \\npattern of domestic criminal harassment with different intimate partners, primarily \\nthe mother of his children. \\nDr. Pearce opines that Mr. Hamelin is a medium to high risk to re-offend, \\nalthough in the lower risk to do so violently. \\n. . . \\nThe aggravating factors as set out by the Crown have been considered by this \\nCourt.  Essentially, the most problematic of them is that Mr. Hamelin appears \\nunrepentant, or at least presently unwilling to want to change his life for the \\nbetter.  He sees the terms of the Long-Term Supervision Order as being of no \\nbenefit to him rather than it providing a structure which, if followed, could be a \\nplan or recipe for his future success in the community.  Efforts have been made to \\naccommodate his complaints, such as arranging for him to attend at a different \\nresidence other than the Keele Centre. \\n. . . \\nMr. Hamelin has made some efforts to pursue counselling, not so much treatment, \\nand other rehabilitative efforts while at the Metro South Detention Centre.  He \\nmeets regularly with Ms. Astri, the chaplain.  He meets periodically with a \\ngentleman named Nolan, a social worker at the same facility.  He also meets \\nperiodically with a mental health and justice worker from St. Margaret’s Housing \\nand Community Support Services, and he has been placed in touch with Brain \\nInjury Services in Barrie, Ontario, to continue to receive information and perhaps \\nconnect with them once released from custody. \\nMr. Hamelin enjoys continued pro-social support from his family.  His parents \\nreside in Midland.  His father, John Hamelin, is quite concerned for his son’s \\nwelfare and mental health issues.  Mr. Hamelin Sr. has attended court regularly \\nand, through counsel, has indicated that he and his family members will continue \\nto support their son once released. \\n. . . \\nThe Court is aware, and it has been documented, that Mr. Hamelin rather \\nunfortunately sustained a brain injury, a serious head trauma from a motor vehicle \\naccident at the age of 17.  This has caused him to be impulsive from time to time.  \\n. . . \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nMr. Hamelin is not without skills.  His work history has included sales of \\nrecreational vehicles, small engine work in the Wasaga Beach area, and he has \\nworked over the years as an artist.  He has continued to take art therapy with Mr. \\nChris Liu while at the Metro South Detention Centre.  Mr. Liu is also a registered \\npsychotherapist.  Art is very important to Mr. Hamelin.  More will be said about \\nthat momentarily. \\n. . . \\n… Most significant is Mr. Hamelin’s loss of hearing, believed to be connected, \\nmedically, to his brain injury.  This has also incidentally affected his memory, \\nresulting in compromised cognitive abilities, exacerbated by a personality \\ndisorder, and acute stressors have precipitated some suicidal ideation.  In more lay \\nterms, Mr. Hamelin often presents as being highly impulsive with poor coping \\nskills.  There is reference to a diagnosis of dysthymia, which is referrable, in law \\nterms, as chronic depression. \\n. . . \\n… After Mr. Hamelin’s apprehension on March 28, 2017, he was transferred to \\nJoyceville Institution, as his Supervision Order is Federally administered.  \\nUnfortunately, he was severely assaulted, physically and sexually, by other \\ninmates, resulting in serious trauma.  He subsequently suffered a seizure for the \\nfirst time and was taken to a hospital in the Kingston area for testing.  If sentenced \\nto a further period of custody, it will be served in a Federal institution, which his \\ncounsel has submitted would be a frightening prospect for him given his previous \\nexperience. \\nAmong his plan or plans, he is hoping, in due course, to be able to move to Elliot \\nLake with his mother, and certainly to resume employment in the sale of \\nrecreational vehicles, and to continue his artwork. \\n. . . \\nThere is no doubt that Mr. Hamelin still poses as a risk.  There has been a history \\nof non-compliance.  He has remained, for much of the time, rather intransigent, \\nmeaning rigid and inflexible in his attitude toward supervision and counselling.  \\nTherefore, management of these risks will continue to be problematic. \\n. . . \\nMr. Hamelin has spoken again to the Court today very well.  The Court has noted \\na change in his attitude.  The Court is left with a degree of confidence that Mr. \\nHamelin can now accept that the plan for him can, indeed, be a recipe for his \\nsuccessor.” \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\n[28] \\n \\nDr. Gray also reviewed Mr. Hamelin’s personal circumstances in great detail in his \\ncourt ordered assessment report and in his trial testimony. \\nCriminal Record \\n[29] \\n \\nHis criminal record is documented in Exhibit 1, Tab 4, Ex.2 and Ex.6. \\n[30] \\n \\nDr. Gray notes that Mr. Hamelin’s crimes do not involve substance abuse, sexual \\nmisconduct or physical violence. \\n[31] \\n \\nHis criminal offending commenced in 2002 and involves criminal harassment of \\ndomestic female partners after those partners had terminated their relationship with him. His \\ncriminal record consists of 5 prior convictions for criminal harassment against former domestic \\npartners. His criminal record also consists of 14 convictions for failure to comply with court orders \\nand 3 convictions for breaches of his Long-Term Supervision Order. \\n[32] \\n \\nHis offending against AB, his previous victim, extended over years. \\n[33] \\n \\nIn her submissions, Crown counsel points out that on 6 occasions, Mr. Hamelin has \\nbeen charged while subject to probation orders, on bail or subject to Family Court orders. \\n[34] \\n \\nCrown counsel also submits that his criminal record indicates that he has been \\ncharged within days or weeks of release from custody. \\n[35] \\n \\nHe has been convicted for offences committed while in jail and subject to non-\\ncommunication orders. \\n[36] \\n \\nDr. Gray reported and testified that the index offences against HN are an escalation \\nof his criminal conduct insofar as he intended to hurt his victim rather than inspire reconciliation \\nwith the former partner as was the case in prior crimes. \\n[37] \\n \\nThe circumstances of his prior convictions which began in 2002 are set out in the \\ntranscripts of conviction and sentence filed by the Crown, Exhibit 2. \\n[38] \\n \\nThe courts in those cases identify Mr. Hamelin’s failure to abide court orders and \\nindeed committing crimes while subject to court orders. It is identified that he is unwilling to take \\nresponsibility for his criminal conduct. Anger management issues are identified but as Dr. Gray \\nnotes Mr. Hamelin does not accept that he requires treatment for anger management. Mr. Hamelin \\nportrays himself as the victim. He minimizes his responsibility. He has demonstrated his complete \\ninability or unwillingness to restrain himself from criminal conduct involving repeated and \\nincessant unwanted and unlawful communication with domestic partners who have terminated \\ntheir relationship with him. His criminal offending includes communication with former partners \\nwhile in custody and under treatment. \\n[39] \\n \\nOn November 28, 2014, following guilty pleas and a finding of guilt and conviction \\nof criminal harassment and 2 charges of fail to comply with probation order involving \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\ncommunication with a prior domestic partner, AB, Mr. Hamelin was sentenced to a brief period of \\nincarceration in addition to presentence custody and to a 4 year long term supervision order. \\n[40] \\n \\nIt is of note that at that sentencing hearing, Mr. Hamelin resiled from his guilty \\npleas and maintained that he was not guilty, despite a joint submission by Crown and his defence \\ncounsel.  He told the court that he rejected the joint sentence proposal and the terms being imposed \\nupon him. \\nThe 3 Breaches of Long-Term Supervision Order \\nBreach #1 \\n[41] \\n \\nAfter he was sentenced by Justice Meijers on November 28, 2014, and had served \\nthe brief provincial jail term imposed, he commenced to serve the LTSO on February 25 or 26, \\n2015 at the Keele Centre. Despite a core special condition of his LTSO to report attempts to initiate \\nintimate sexual or nonsexual friendships with females, he did not do so at any time until he was \\nbreached for failing to do so on April 22, 2015. \\n[42] \\n \\nOn February 4, 2016, he was convicted in the Ontario Court of Justice for that \\nbreach. \\n[43] \\n \\nOn March 1, 2016, in respect of that conviction, and having served presentence \\ncustody of 306 days, namely 10 months and one day, he was sentenced to 29 days more, for an \\neffective sentence of 11 months. In the sentence decision of Justice Nakatsuru, it was noted that \\nthis was a breach of a core special condition. Although no one was harmed, the offence involved \\nrepeated attempts to contact a number of females. It was a designed effort. The judge noted that \\nMr. Hamelin had a long history of failing to comply with court orders. It was noted that this was \\na “pattern”. \\nBreach #2 \\n[44] \\n \\nOn March 18, 2016, Mr. Hamelin was released from provincial jail after serving \\nthe sentence for Breach #1. \\n[45] \\n \\nOn March 29, 2016, he resumed serving his LTSO at the Keele Centre. \\n[46] \\n \\nOn April 4, 2016, 6 days later, he went unlawfully at large. \\n[47] \\n \\nHe was at large until April 12, 2016 when he was arrested, 8 days. \\n[48] \\n \\nHe was sentenced on March 17, 2017 for that breach by Justice Shamai. It was \\nnoted in the decision that he had not received a drug while at Keele as had been prescribed by Dr. \\nPearce. Also, he had “not received any kind of contact with the mental health professional or any \\nsort of medical professional during the early time that he was at the Keele Centre”, prior to going \\nUAL. The court specifically noted that he had received no programming while at the South \\nDetention Centre. There was no ability to reintegrate into the community. He was on continuous \\nlockdown for 337 days with no access to medication. The Justice noted “I am keen that Mr. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nHamelin have every opportunity to take advantage of the programming available to him for the \\npurpose of rehabilitation and importantly, reintegration in the community. This latest breach is a \\nbreach by not staying at the Keele Centre where he says the conditions were unbearable to him \\nand he did not have access to the medication which has been prescribed for him.” \\n[49] \\n \\nThe Justice gave him credit for the 337 days spent in actual presentence custody, \\nenhanced by 1.3/1 to 438 days, and imposed a one day jail sentence. \\nBreach #3 \\n[50] \\n \\nMr. Hamelin was returned to the Toronto South Detention Centre on March 17, \\n2017, from which he was released late in the day to continue to serve his LTSO at St. Leonard’s \\nHouse in Brampton. He was told to get himself to Brampton in 3 hours and apparently given no \\ntransportation or assistance to do so. He started to walk to Brampton.  After some hours, he called \\na friend and stayed with a friend in Barrie until he was arrested on March 28, 2017. \\n[51] \\n \\nOn July 18, 2018, for that breach, he was sentenced to 1 day in jail on top of 444 \\ndays, 1 year 2 months and 18 days, pre-sentence custody. \\n[52] \\n \\nHe was released back onto his LTSO to reside at Henry Trail CCC in Kingston. \\n[53] \\n \\nThis was the decision of Justice Clark noted previously. \\n[54] \\n \\nThe evidence is that while residing at Henry Trail, and up to the expiry of his LTSO, \\nMr. Hamelin was convicted of no further breaches or of causing harm to other persons. \\n[55] \\n \\nThe index offences occurred some months following the expiration of the \\nsupervision and the residency at Henry Trail. \\nDr. Jonathan Gray \\n[56] \\n \\nDr. Gray is an experienced and highly qualified forensic psychiatrist. He was \\naccepted by the court as an expert witness to give opinion evidence in the field of forensic \\npsychiatry and, in particular, on the assessment of risk and risk management in the context of \\ndangerous offender proceedings. \\n[57] \\n \\nDr. Gray’s evidence is detailed, professional and comprehensive.  I have considered \\ncarefully his report and testimony. \\n[58] \\n \\nHe had reviewed the materials provided to him by the Crown Attorney including \\nthe Agreed Statement of Fact, transcripts of Mr. Hamelin\\'s previous convictions and sentences, \\nVictim Impact Statements by HN and AB, medical records from the many doctors and health care \\nprofessionals who had assessed and treated Mr. Hamelin in the past, probation records, his CAS \\nrecords and his criminal record. He had interviewed Mr. Hamelin in person and, as well, he had \\ninterviewed his former chaplain and friend, Ms. Astri. \\n[59] \\n \\nI have summarized Dr. Gray’s evidence using the headings in his report. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nMr. Hamelin\\'s Version of these Offences and Prior Offences \\n[60] \\n \\nDr. Gray stated that Mr. Hamelin justified his crimes against HN saying that he \\nwanted his victim to feel empty, hurt and ashamed. He wanted to emotionally hurt her, to cause \\nher to suffer some psychological harm, to make her feel exactly how he felt. He told the doctor \\nthat he felt so overwhelmed by his feelings that he did not think he would go to jail. \\n[61] \\n \\nWith respect to his prior domestic partner relationship offences, Mr. Hamelin \\ndenied his guilt in large part despite the convictions. \\nMr. Hamelin\\'s Opinion on his past Treatment Interventions \\n[62] \\n \\nHe denied receiving any benefit from past treatments except with respect to his \\nacquired brain injury. \\nReview of Psychiatric Symptoms \\n[63] \\n \\nMr. Hamelin denied ever being depressed and attributed his many threats of suicide \\nto feeling stressed. He denied any anxiety disorder or symptoms of psychosis. He denied any \\nsymptoms of post traumatic stress disorder, but he had unresolved issues with respect to his mother \\nleaving the family when he was 12 years of age. \\nSubstance Use History \\n[64] \\n \\nThere is no history of substance abuse. \\nFamily Psychiatric History \\n[65] \\n \\nThere is no history of family suicide, mental illness or substance abuse. \\nSocial and Occupational History \\n[66] \\n \\nMr. Hamelin has had limited employment and no long term employment. \\n[67] \\n \\nMr. Hamelin had 5 previous domestic relationships prior to the one with AB which \\npreceded that with HN. \\nFuture Plans \\n[68] \\n \\nHis plan is to live in Wasaga Beach and develop a business building RV engines \\nand repairing them. \\n[69] \\n \\nHe states that he has no interest in pursuing relationships with women in the future. \\nDr. Gray is of the opinion that this is an unrealistic thought. \\n[70] \\n \\nOn this point, I would note that on March 1, 2016, in regard to offences against AB, \\nMr. Hamelin told Justice Nataksuru that he did not want a relationship with anybody in the future. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\n[71] \\n \\nWithin 2 years, he was entering into a relationship with HN. \\n[72] \\n \\nIn R. v. Cook, 2017 ONSC 1434, Justice BP O’Marra found that the accused’s \\nstatement that he has changed and that his plans including no longer engaging in relationships were \\nunrealistic relapse prevention strategies. \\n[73] \\n \\nThis is the same conclusion reached by Dr. Gray, with respect to Mr. Hamelin. \\nMental status examination \\n[74] \\n \\nMr. Hamelin presented as cooperative and polite and conducted himself \\nappropriately during the interview. \\nMs. Astri \\n[75] \\n \\nShe has known Mr. Hamelin for 5 years having met him as a chaplain when he was \\nincarcerated in a provincial institution. She describes Mr. Hamelin as having suffered a lot of \\nlosses, and that he is not emotionally capable of managing a relationship. She says that he primarily \\nneeds supports for his acquired brain injury. She noted that he didn\\'t benefit in the past from group \\ntreatment or counseling. She observed that he is not able to express when he is feeling sad but \\nrather keeps it in. \\nPrevious Assessments and Treatment Interventions \\n[76] \\n \\nDr. Gray reviewed in detail the many reports outlining the previous psychological, \\nand psychiatric assessments and reports concerning Mr. Hamelin, and the reports of other health \\ncare workers who have attempted to work with him. \\n[77] \\n \\nThese many attempts to address the issues leading to his criminal conduct have not \\nbeen successful and were often met with Mr. Hamelin\\'s denial of his crimes and that he suffered \\nfrom the issues being addressed.  He repeatedly disengaged from the programming described. \\n[78] \\n \\nThe programs included an extended stay at the St. Lawrence Valley Correctional \\nand Treatment Institute for about a year under the psychiatric care of Dr. Cameron. He successfully \\ncompleted some programs but in general he was resistant, in denial and achieved little clinical \\nbenefit. \\n[79] \\n \\nIt is reported that he successfully completed the Integrated Correctional Program \\nModel, Community Program in 2018.  The program was designed to provide a rudimentary level \\nof understanding and skill but was not designed as a replacement for the necessary institutional \\nprograms required before release into the community. He was said not to be engaged in the \\ntreatment and that the risk management plan that he developed was inadequate. He denied his \\nconvictions and allegations. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nThe Acquired Brain Injury, 1997 \\n[80] \\n \\nDr. Gray reviewed in detail the medical records concerning the brain injury that he \\nsuffered in this motor vehicle collision. The effects were consistent with a right frontal lobe injury, \\nbut many of his deficits were said to be premorbid in nature. \\nRecord of Community Supervision and Summary of Charged Incidents \\n[81] \\n \\nDr. Gray reviewed in detail the reports of Mr. Hamelin\\'s criminal record which \\nbegan in 2001. \\n[82] \\n \\nDr. Gray noted that while Mr. Hamelin resided at the Henry Trail CCC, he was \\nsupervised by parole officer Serge Hebert. The supervision and monitoring was close and \\nsuccessful and included the officer communicating with Mr. Hamelin\\'s newest domestic partner, \\nHN. The predicate offences occurred only after the expiry of the LTSO and after HN had \\nterminated the relationship. \\nDSM-5 Diagnoses \\n[83] \\n \\nDr. Gray\\'s opinion is that Mr. Hamelin suffers from borderline personality disorder, \\nBPM. The criteria that he demonstrates are frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, \\nunstable and intense interpersonal relationships, recurrent suicidal behavior or threats, affective \\ninstability due to a marked reactivity of mood, inappropriate and intense anger and difficulty \\ncontrolling anger, and transient stress related paranoid ideations and severe dissociative symptoms. \\nMr. Hamelin has been diagnosed with BPD by 2 other psychiatrists in the past during extended \\nperiods of hospitalization. \\n[84] \\n \\nDr. Gray was of the opinion that both the effects of his acquired brain injury and \\nthe BPD are fixed conditions that cannot be completely ameliorated through medication. He \\nthought it possible that Mr. Hamelin also suffered from ADHD. \\nRisk Assessment \\n[85] \\n \\nMr. Hamelin cannot be scored on the commonly used actuarial risk assessment \\ninstruments due to the absence of any sexual offences or contact violent offences in his record. \\n[86] \\n \\nDr. Gray scored him on the HCR-20 Version 3.  6 of the 10 historical factors were \\nfound to be relevant in terms of risk, namely relationships, employment, personality disorder, \\nnegative treatment response, violent attitudes and the anti social behavior associated with ex \\npartners.  \\n[87] \\n \\nDr. Gray noted that it is highly unusual for a candidate for dangerous offender status \\nto lack the most common risk factors including a history of physical violence, sexual abuse and \\nsubstance abuse. \\n[88] \\n \\nOf the 5 clinical factors considered, Mr. Hamelin showed evidence of 3:  lack of \\ninsight; instability; and treatment response, in that he continues to not see the need for any \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\ntreatment and continues not to have insight into his negative behaviors. He said he was open to \\nfuture treatments but does not think that they are necessary for him.    \\n[89] \\n \\nAll 5 of the risk management factors are relevant to Mr. Hamelin. He requires the \\navailability of professional services in the community.  He requires a living situation that is \\nsupervised such as a CCC, with a residency condition. Stress is a major future risk item. He \\nrequires personal supports which appear to be unavailable except in part through his friend Ms. \\nAsti. \\n[90] \\n \\nDr. Gray found Mr. Hamelin to be at high risk of committing another non-contact \\noffence against a future partner but at low risk of actual physical aggression. \\nPsychopathy Checklist \\n[91] \\nAlthough Mr. Hamelin does not meet the psychological construct of psychopathy, and \\ntherefore theoretically psychopathic traits would not present a barrier to therapy, Dr. Gray \\nidentified the other challenges to successful treatment in his case. \\nDangerous Offender Designation \\nPattern of behaviour \\n[92] \\n \\nIt is Dr. Gray\\'s opinion that there is a clear pattern of criminal behavior \\ndemonstrated in this case. Most of his crimes have been directed against ex-partners upon \\ntermination by them of the relationship. It consists primarily of criminal harassment through \\npersistent and repeated communication known to be unwanted and despite police intervention, \\ncourt order and even jail. He denies doing so and he denies any responsibility. To date, treatments \\ndirected at such conduct, including anger management, have not controlled the risk. \\n[93] \\n \\nIt is uncertain whether burnout with age will occur, given the combination of his \\nacquired brain injury and BPD. \\n[94] \\n \\nDr. Gray is of the opinion, in particular in the face of the victim impact statements \\nby AB and HN that Mr. Hamelin\\'s future risk includes causing severe psychological damage to \\nfuture former partners. He notes that the criminality appears to be escalating. It is now directed at \\ncausing harm to the victim rather than attempting reconciliation. The present crimes show more \\nabusive, degrading and threatening unwanted contact directed at both the victim and her employer \\nand dance troupe. \\n[95] \\n \\nHis impulsivity and explosive anger fueling his behavior is another aspect of BPD \\nwhich, combined with his frontal lobe damage, likely worsens these traits and may make them \\nmore enduring, that is, not amenable to treatment. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\nHigh Likelihood of Recidivism \\n[96] \\n \\nDr. Gray\\'s opinion is that the history of the persistence of the criminal behavior \\novertime against former partners with severe consequences suggests a high risk that this will \\npersist in the future. \\n[97] \\n \\nHis lack of amenability to treatment is another factor suggesting high risk and it \\ncannot be said that the trend to burnout may occur. \\nMr. Hamelin\\'s Behaviour is Intractable \\n[98] \\n \\nDr. Gray explains that there is abundant psychiatric evidence to support the legal \\nquestion of Mr. Hamelin\\'s risk being considered intractable. He is highly unlikely to develop the \\ninternal controls with time and treatment for him to manage his offending behaviors. \\nCan the risk be managed? \\nOpinion and Recommendations on Release Conditions and their Feasibility \\n[99] \\n \\nDr. Gray is of the opinion that if Mr. Hamelin were to reside in the community, a \\nnumber of safeguards would be necessary to manage the risk that he poses: \\n\\uf0b7 He would require as part of a federal penitentiary term to participate in \\nrecommended group or individual treatment offered by CSC. The main issues to be \\naddressed would include managing powerful emotions, healthy relationships and \\nmaking good decisions. It is problematic that he denies having a problem with \\nanger. \\n\\uf0b7 If released into the community, he should be released to a supervised residence such \\nas a CCC, with a dedicated probation officer. \\n\\uf0b7 He requires ongoing assistance in dealing with the effects of his acquired brain \\ninjury. \\n\\uf0b7 He requires ongoing counseling and therapy in the community including the full \\nprogram of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioral therapy \\n(DBT). \\n\\uf0b7 He would benefit from medication including anti anxiety and mood stabilizing \\nmedications. \\n\\uf0b7 He requires the consistent involvement of a psychiatrist to manage his medications \\nand help direct him to appropriate psychological therapy. \\n\\uf0b7 The final area needing management is his history of dysfunctional relationships \\nparticularly upon their dissolution. Any such relationships must be closely \\nmonitored by his probation officers. For the reasons set out in his report at page 67, \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\nit is Dr. Gray\\'s opinion that the likelihood of control of Mr. Hamelin\\'s risk of \\nharassing future ex partners is relatively low even with the necessary risk \\nmanagement interventions. \\nCross examination \\n[100]  \\nDr. Gray was unable to say whether the normal declining trajectory of persons \\nsuffering from Mr. Hamelin’s challenges would occur in view of the combination of both the \\nacquired brain injury and the borderline personality disorder.  He agreed that it is unknown how \\nthe future is going to play out.  “I don’t think it’s going to make it any faster, so it’s either no \\neffects or it means it lasts longer.” \\n[101]  \\nIn his cross-examination of Dr. Gray, defence counsel identified treatments and \\nprogramming and counselling that had been offered to Mr. Hamelin but were not effectively \\noffered, therapies that had not been offered to him and treatment and counselling and medication \\nthat hadn’t been offered to him but could have been of some benefit. The degree or extent of any \\nbenefit arising therefrom was not identified. \\n[102]  \\nHe testified that apart from a genetic component causing the borderline personality \\ndisorder, the only possible triggering event for it may have been the abandonment of Mr. Hamelin \\nand his family by his mother when he was age 12. It appears that no treatment, counselling or \\ntherapy has been offered to him to address and resolve this issue. Dr. Gray pointed out that such a \\ntrauma would not normally stand out as being particularly traumatic beyond the ordinary. \\n[103]  \\nIt was also identified that it does not appear that he has had any specific counselling \\nor therapy to help them understand what border line personality disorder is and how to deal with \\nit. Although Dr. Gray suggested that that would be pretty standard group therapy. \\n[104]  \\nDr. Gray agreed that the medication Lamotrigine might be beneficial to Mr. \\nHamelin in dealing with the symptoms arising from his borderline personality disorder. That would \\nbe something that he would prescribe. He agreed that it was at least worth trying and might be very \\nwell suited for treating Mr. Hamelin’s borderline personality disorder without the associated side \\neffects. \\n[105]  \\nDr. Gray was of the opinion that Mr. Hamelin would benefit from a whole course \\nof cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and of dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT). He has not \\nhad these therapies. It appears that he had one session of modified CBT and one session of DBT. \\nDr. Gray acknowledged that Mr. Hamelin has not had the opportunity for a full course of a good \\nDBT program with a good facilitator and qualified staff. He agreed that CBT and DBT therapy are \\ncornerstones of therapy for people with borderline personality disorders. He agreed that a \\ncomprehensive CBT and DBT therapeutic program would be the best thing for someone suffering \\nfrom Mr. Hamelin’s disorder. He stated that DBT would be the most useful for Mr. Hamelin. But \\nwith respect to the remission rates for a person suffering from borderline personality disorder after \\nhaving the benefit of DBT, Dr. Gray could only say that it must be greater than zero. \\n[106]  \\nDr. Gray reported that Mr. Hamelin told him that he would do the high intensity \\nICPM if it was mandated within the penitentiary. He told Dr. Gray he would engage in that therapy. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\n[107]  \\nDr. Gray agreed that it does not appear that there has been any treatment with \\nrespect to the impact of Mr. Hamelin’s hearing disability on him, for example making friends, \\nparticipating in class, self-esteem, participate in Society or being successful in school. Dr. Gray \\nsaid that that could be a potential avenue to explore. \\n[108]  \\nDr. Gray had noted that Mr. Hamelin did have the benefit of professional assistance \\nwith respect to his acquired brain injury, and he engaged in it, but it does not appear that anyone \\nhas ever talk to him about the impact of the combination of his brain injury, his hearing impairment \\nin combination with the borderline personality disorder. \\n[109]  \\nDr. Gray acknowledged that there was a gap in Mr. Hamelin’s criminal record \\nbetween 2002 and 2011. He acknowledged that it does not appear that the reasons for this apparent \\nsuccess have been explored professionally. He testified that to some extent this gap could be \\nexplained by the lower intensity and shorter duration of the relationships during that timeframe. \\n[110]  \\nDr. Gray noted that the nature of Mr. Hamelin’s offending does not require that he \\nbe in close physical proximity to the victim. Hence previous court orders, probation, and jail have \\nnot been sufficient to manage the risk he presents. \\n[111]  \\nDr. Gray agreed that to her Hamelin does not do well in group therapy. Group \\ntherapy has formed a large part of that which has been offered to him. \\n[112]  \\nDr. Gray noted that the ICPM, community-based, that Mr. Hamelin participated in \\nwhile at Henry Trail was a group program and dealt with topics that didn’t involve Mr. Hamelin’s \\nproblem. He agreed that a lot of that content might not have been relevant to Mr. Hamelin. \\n[113]  \\nDr. Gray noted that art therapy could be helpful for Mr. Hamelin. \\n[114]  \\nDr. Gray agreed that the residential condition at Henry Trail combined with the \\nclose supervision provided by probation officer Serge Hebert resulted in no criminal charges by \\nMr. Hamelin while in play. \\n[115]  \\nDr. Gray agreed that the therapy, psychiatric treatment, medication and \\nprogramming identified by him and available in the CSC system are designed to provide people \\nlike Mr. Hamelin with the skills to control his behaviour. These treatments are designed to help \\noffenders gain insight into their problems. \\n[116]  \\nHis opinion that Mr. Hamelin is likely to cause severe psychological injury in the \\nfuture is more than a 50% risk even if all of the foregoing treatments, therapies and programming \\nwere offered to him. \\nStephen Eros \\n[117]  \\nHe has been the program manager and facilitator for CSC since 2018. He is \\npresently the program manager at Warkworth Institution and is the acting regional manager for \\nboth the indigenous and non-indigenous programming. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\n[118]  \\nHe described the intake process for an inmate sentenced to federal penitentiary. The \\nassessment takes 4 to 6 months to establish a correctional plan for the inmate. The integrated \\ncorrectional programming module does not specifically address individual offenders for sexual \\nabuse or physical violence rather there is one program delivered to all of these offenders. The \\nintegrated correctional program module, multi target, addresses domestic violence, substance \\nabuse and general crime but not sexual offending. He testified that the module uses cognitive \\nbehavioral therapy. \\n[119]  \\nThere are two phases. In the primer phase, for non sex offenders, there are 10 \\nsessions which begin by looking at the year prior to the offending to understand the link of the \\nlifestyle to the criminal conduct. This is in group sessions with 10 participants for each facilitator. \\nIf an offender does not do well in a group, there are special facilitators who will assist with one-\\non-one additional help. In the primer phase, the criminal risk indicator is determined, and the \\noffender will be classified as needing the high risk program, moderate risk or low risk. \\n[120]  \\nIn the moderate risk program, there are 50 sessions, 2 to 2 1/2 hours each. In the \\nhigh risk program, there are 96 sessions and more time is spent with the offenders. \\n[121]  \\nHe described the 5 modules that make up the high intensity program. \\n[122]  \\nThere is also a motivational module which has three streams. The support stream \\nassists offenders struggling in the program for whatever reason. The refuser module deals with \\noffenders who do not want to participate. The dropout module deals with those offenders who \\nsimply quit the program. The motivational module facilitators can engage throughout or at any \\npoint in the high intensity programming. Mental health services can be accessed if required. CBT \\nand elements of DBT are part of the ICPM. \\n[123]  \\nThe programming offered within the institution is significantly more intensive than \\nthe programming offered in the community. For example, for the moderate risk program there are \\nonly 16 sessions offered in the community compared to the 50 sessions offered within the \\ninstitution. It is noted that Mr. Hamelin has been exposed to the ICPM, Community programming. \\nHe offended against HN thereafter, in an escalating way, compared to his previous offending. \\n[124]  \\nThere are also community maintenance programs, 12 sessions, once a week. \\n[125]  \\nHe explained that within the institution, programming is offered on a prioritization \\nbasis tied to release eligibility dates. Those with the earliest release eligibility dates get \\nprogramming first. He testified that offenders requiring the high intensity programming need to be \\nin the federal penitentiary for at least six months after placement into the parent institution, \\nfollowing intake. Ms. Howie testified that a sentence of 3 years in the penitentiary would assure \\nthe offender would have time to complete the high intensity programming. Like Ms. Howie, Mr. \\nEros agreed that with a 2-3 year federal sentence, a person could get priority and be able to finish \\nthe high intensity program before statutory release and likely before his parole eligibility dates. \\n[126]  \\nHe testified that within the institution, the offender has the opportunity to complete \\ngrade 12 and secure some employment. Post secondary education opportunities are also available. \\nThe offender can do both programming and school or work each day. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 18 \\n \\n \\n[127]  \\nHe testified that those with learning disabilities can be assisted by the motivational \\nmodule facilitator or there is an adaptive treatment program available at the regional treatment \\ncentres. \\nCross examination \\n[128]  \\nWith respect to offenders such as Mr. Hamelin, who suffer from BPD, ABI and \\nADHD, in the high intensity programming, each facilitator works with each individual in the \\ngroup. Attempts are made to accommodate the offender’s challenges including engaging mental \\nhealth services. The program can be tailored to the individual needs arising from disability. \\n[129]  \\nHe testified that CBT is a module that is delivered. There are also elements of DBT \\ndelivered. \\n[130]  \\nHe testified that the programming can accommodate cognitive and hearing \\nchallenges. \\n[131]  \\nHe testified that the programming could address Dr. Gray\\'s opinion that Mr. \\nHamelin requires a full program of CBT and DBT to the extent of being helpful. He has seen the \\nresults. \\nJennifer Howie \\n[132]  \\nShe is an experienced parole officer supervisor, and is presently the acting area \\ndirector. \\n[133]  \\nShe described the intake procedure for an offender sentenced to a federal \\npenitentiary. With the information that is obtained during intake, the parole officer develops a \\ncorrectional plan suited for the inmate. The correctional plan is a living document which is updated \\nas needed to accommodate changes in needs or risk or situations, for example, completion of a \\nprogram or application for release on parole or statutory release. The correctional plan identifies \\nprogramming needs and intervention needs. \\n[134]  \\nFor an offender sentenced to a provincial sentence followed by a LTSO, there is \\nnot as full or comprehensive an assessment carried out. The assessment is carried out by a \\ncommunity parole officer. The offender cannot be offered the high intensity programs that are \\navailable in the federal institutions if sentenced to provincial time. The community programming \\nis about 10 to 14 sessions compared to the federal high intensity programs which are comprised of \\n100 or more sessions. \\n[135]  \\nAs did Mr. Eros, she described that entry into the high intensity program is \\nprioritized based on the inmate’s release eligibility dates. The shorter the sentence, the sooner the \\noffender is able to access the high intensity programming. For a dangerous offender with an \\nindeterminate sentence, his eligibility date is set at 7 years from date of arrest, therefore, he would \\nbe less of a priority for programming compared to an offender serving a shorter federal sentence. \\nShe stated that all inmates are offered programming. If an offender declines programming, he is \\nbumped from his priority and the program is offered to the next inmate in line. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 19 \\n \\n \\n[136]  \\nThe parole officer makes recommendations to the Parole Board of Canada for \\nconditions, for example, release on day parole or to a CCC. \\n[137]  \\nShe described the procedures that occur if an inmate breaches or is suspected of \\nbreaching a condition imposed by the Parole Board. \\n[138]   \\nShe testified that the highest level of supervision within a CCC, for example, on a \\nLTSO, with the residence condition, consists of a meeting with the parole officer 8 times per \\nmonth, that is 2 times per week. She said that if an assessment of need and intervention requires \\nmore frequent supervision, that is available. In the CCC, the inmate is assigned to a designated \\nparole officer for the duration of his residency condition. That parole officer has a caseload of 10 \\ninmates. There are 40 beds at Henry Trail with 4 parole officers. \\n[139]  \\nShe explained that a residency condition on a LTSO would have the inmate living \\neither in a CRF which is privately operated, or in a CCC, which is operated by CSC.  It is the CRF \\nthat decides whether it will accept a given inmate, whereas the CCC must find a bed for the inmate. \\nA sentencing judge would not know which type of residence the offender would be accepted into \\nor assigned to. \\n[140]  \\nShe testified that there are many programs available at the Henry Trail residence, a \\nCCC. \\nCross examination \\n[141]  \\nThe point was made that as a parole officer, she has supervised many inmates \\nserving a LTSO, but she cannot remember supervising any dangerous offender on parole. \\nPresumably, the point is that few dangerous offenders serving indeterminate sentences achieve \\nparole. \\n[142]  \\nThe guiding principle for CSC is the rehabilitation and reintegration of the inmate \\nback into the community. The paramount consideration is the safety of the public. \\n[143]  \\nShe testified that the parole officers are trained and supervised to achieve these \\ngoals with respect to the various challenges that inmates present, including recidivism, denial, \\nrepeat offenders and personality disorders. \\n[144]  \\nShe testified that if an offender was sentenced to a 2 year federal term of \\nimprisonment, there would be sufficient time to permit that offender to complete a high intensity \\nprogram before being released on his LTSO. Obviously, the longer the sentence of federal \\nimprisonment, the more time there would be to ensure completion of the high intensity program.  \\nShe testified that a 3 year penitentiary term would ensure completion of the ICPM High Intensity.  \\nThe high intensity programming, multi target, is available at most institutions. \\n[145]  \\nIf an inmate who had been sentenced to federal imprisonment entered the intake \\nprocess with a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and report as to needs and risk such as Dr. \\nGray’s report in Mr. Hamelin’s case, the parole officer would accept that opinion and report and \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 20 \\n \\n \\nnot require a further in-house psychiatric assessment when putting together the correctional plan. \\nThis eliminates that delay. \\n[146]  \\nAn inmate could be referred to the regional treatment centre for psychiatric \\ntreatment based on the psychiatric evaluation received from the court proceedings. \\n[147]  \\nShe gave evidence with respect to the scenario of an inmate attending a community \\nAA program who would obviously meet other people with diverse backgrounds and issues. The \\ninmate is not supervised on such outings. She acknowledged that this would lead to opportunity \\nfor friendships and relationships to develop. To supervise for example, Mr. Hamelin, given his \\nbackground offence cycle, the parole officer would rely on his self reporting. There should be a \\ncondition that he reports attempting to initiate and initiating friendships and relationships. The \\nparole officer can monitor his cell phone including texts although they are not skilled at extracting \\nall of the information. The parole officer can insist on interviewing the new partner so that she is \\nable to make an informed decision and if there were any reluctance on the offender’s part or the \\npartner’s part to be forthcoming, the parole officer could issue a local instruction and recommend \\na change in special condition prohibiting the contact. \\n[148]  \\nThey have had conditions prohibiting cell phone and Internet use. \\n[149]  \\nIt is required that the parole officer meet with the offender at the outset of \\nsupervision to explain the conditions of the LTSO and how the parole officer is going to supervise \\nand enforce those conditions. This is documented in the parole officer notes for the inmate file. \\n[150]  \\nWhen asked as to language permitting supervision of the development of \\nfriendships and relationships for example through AA meetings and coffee privately thereafter, \\nMs. Howe referred to the language at Exhibit 4, Tab 34, “Immediately report any attempts to \\ninitiate intimate sexual and non sexual friendships females to your parole Supervisor” and \\n“Immediately report all intimate sexual and nonsexual relationships and friendships with females \\nto your parole supervisor”.  \\n[151]  \\nIt is to be noted that at Tab 35 is a parole board decision extending Mr. Hamelin’s \\nresidency condition for an additional 150 days which states, “There are no leave privileges.  You \\nmust return to the facility nightly”. This is of concern as it appears to permit free access to the \\ncommunity during the day on an unsupervised basis. \\n[152]  \\nMs. Howie would tell the offender that he must disclose to her all of the information \\nthat she requires with respect to a new proposed relationship and that she will be following up with \\nthe proposed partner.  He must disclose to a proposed friend all of his relevant background \\ninformation.  When she follows up with the proposed partner, she makes sure that the offender has \\ntold her all of the necessary background information and if he has not done so she fills in the gaps. \\nShe says that in doing so she balances the public safety requirement against the offender’s privacy \\nrights. The parole officer has the power to prohibit inappropriate contact initially through local \\ninstruction which then can be turned into a special condition by the Parole Board on the input of \\nthe parole officer. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 21 \\n \\n \\n[153]  \\nThe parole officer would advise the inmate that the context of the word \\n“relationship” in a special condition contemplates, the exchange of personal information, seeing \\neach other regularly or seeing each other outside of the permitted group, for example AA, and \\ngoing for coffee together after such a meeting. \\nKaren Thomson \\n[154]  \\nMrs. Thomson has been the Regional Manager of conditional release programs for \\nthe Parole Board of Canada since October of 2018. She has worked with the parole board including \\nas a senior case review officer since 2001. \\n[155]  \\nFor a dangerous offender sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, the first eligibility \\nreview for day or full parole is 7 years from the date of arrest. That inmate could apply 3 years \\nprior to that for day parole.  This timing means that Mr. Hamelin could apply immediately upon \\ncommittal to a penitentiary for these offences. That inmate’s eligibility for day and full parole is \\nreviewed every second year, thereafter. \\n[156]  \\nShe testified that in imposing special conditions on a particular inmate the parole \\nboard considers all of the information that it receives from the court after sentencing including \\npsychiatric reports, the judge’s reasons, criminal record, victim impact statements, information \\nconcerning any family support and the inmate’s perspective on his offences. CSC develops the \\ncorrectional plan which is updated from time to time as needed with respect to risk and necessary \\ninterventions. Special conditions can also be updated as necessary as is seen in the materials where \\nthe parole board extended the residential requirement for a further 150 days in 2018. (Ex.4, Tab \\n35). \\n[157]  \\nPsychiatric reports are required for indeterminate sentences. These must be updated \\nevery two years to coincide with the two year release eligibility review. \\n[158]  \\nShe explained how victims are entitled for notice of release review and to provide \\ninput, attend hearings, request conditions, and receive copies of parole board decisions. \\n[159]  \\nAt the current time, the residency condition extends to a maximum of 365 days for \\na person on a LTSO. That can be extended if requested by CSC. If CSC does not request the \\nextension, then the condition expires.  The residency condition could be extended yearly for up to \\nthe full duration of the LTSO. This appears to have been the case for Mr. Hamelin’s first LTSO, \\nalthough it was interrupted by periods of incarceration for breaches.  It was extended for an \\nadditional 150 days. \\n[160]  \\nAn inmate on a residency condition, LTSO, can earn up to 3 overnight leaves \\noutside the CCC. \\nCross examination \\n[161]  \\nShe testified that the special conditions imposed by the parole board are those that \\nare reasonable and necessary to protect society and to promote the rehabilitation and reintegration \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 22 \\n \\n \\nof the offender into society. The protection of the public is paramount. The parole board has broad \\npowers to promote these principles. \\n[162]  \\nSpecial conditions that can be imposed by the parole board include prohibiting \\nassociation with vulnerable persons in the community if that is part of the offence cycle, confined \\nto the CCC unless in the company of a staff member, and report friendships and relationships. The \\nparole board has the power, theoretically, to impose a condition of having no relationship \\nwhatsoever with a female at all if such a condition was reasonable and necessary to protect Society \\nand to promote the rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender into society. \\n[163]  \\nThere are 692 dangerous offenders serving indeterminate sentences in Canada. Of \\nthese, 21 are on day parole, 36 are on full parole and 4 others were on parole but have been \\ndeported. The point is that only 8.8% of the dangerous offenders sentenced to indeterminate \\nsentences have achieved parole. It is very difficult for dangerous offenders sentenced to an \\nindeterminate sentence to achieve release on parole. On average, it takes such an offender about \\n16.7 years from date of arrest to his first grant of day parole. \\n[164]  \\nIt is only the Parole Board of Canada which has the power to apply to a Court to \\nreduce the duration of a LTSO. The offender has no power to do that. \\nInstitutional Records \\nNo Success with Previous Treatment \\n[165]  \\nAs stated by Dr. Gray, in part, Mr. Hamelin reported to him that prior treatment \\nopportunities, other than for his ABI, were not helpful and of no benefit to him. \\n[166]  \\nThe CSC Assessment for Decision dated October 11, 2018, recommended \\nextending the residence condition at Henry Trail.  It reported that his risk to public is considered \\nto be relatively high, and that he remained a high risk to reoffend: \\n“The subject started the ICPM program on October 1st, 2018 given at a frequency \\nof 3 sessions a week.  He has completed module 1 of this program.  To date his \\nparticipation is rated as very negative.  Some of this is caused by not having the \\nproper hearing aid equipment, however most of his lack of participation is due to \\na lack of motivation.   \\n. . . \\nAs mentioned above Mr. Hamelin is considered to not be engaged in his \\nCorrectional Plan.  However due to his hearing impairment and lack of motivation \\nthe long term benefits of his rehabilitation at HTCCC have yet to be tested and his \\nadherence to positive rehabilitation will not be fully demonstrated until Hamelin \\nfully integrates into the community.   \\nGiven the offender’s abysmal performance while on past supervision it is \\npremature to remove the residency condition at this time.  Sufficient reduction of \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 23 \\n \\n \\nrisk has not been achieved during his current residency period at HTCCC.  \\nTherefore, a prolongation of his residency condition is being recommended. … \\nThe subject still requires a very structured and closely monitored release into the \\ncommunity which requires the prolongation of his current residency condition to \\nensure public safety. \\nAs mentioned above the subject remains a high risk to reoffend and in addition \\nhas no alternate residence nor has he made plans in the event his residency \\ncondition is removed.” \\n[167]  \\nThe residency condition was extended to the end of his LTSO in February 2019. \\n[168]  \\nMr. Hamelin was offered the ICPM, Community Based, from October 1 to \\nNovember 26, 2018 while a resident at Henry Trail. \\n[169]  \\nThe Program Performance Report Final prepared in December 2018 reported: \\n“Mr. Hamelin participated in the ICPM Community Program from October 1, \\n2018 to November 26, 2018.  During interview he was honest with his discontent \\nto participate in correctional programming and his insistence of his innocence of \\nhis convictions in correctional programming and his insistence of his innocence of \\nhis convictions resulting in his LTSO e.g. partner violence/aggression, criminal \\nharassment against two prior intimate partners.  Offender Management System \\nreports (Doucette 2014-12-09) indicate these behaviours of narcissistic qualities, \\ntelling stories not based on fact or goal directed.  His presentations and \\nverbalizations noted in these reports indicate limitations on his cognitive abilities \\nwith various mood presentations and showing attention deficits.  CPO considered \\nthese noted historical and current presentations for his group involvement.  Other \\ndocumented responsivity (impacts on his ability to learn) issues were also \\nconsidered as Mr. Hamelin self declared his hearing impairment.  \\nAccommodations included use of the visual SMARTBOARD for worksheets, \\nextra time for homework, small group setting, frequent breaks and the offer of a \\nvolunteer to assist him with homework and repletion.  Mr. Hamelin declined the \\noffer of a volunteer and managed with most of his homework assignments.  He \\nhad to be redirected in his responses to include how he was using the skills, not \\nhis new girlfriend’s use which was standard in his contributions.  This may be an \\nindicator of his denial to accept his criminal behaviours and consequences and/or \\nresponsivity presentations.  His initial presentations showed marked lack of \\nengagement, presenting with distracting behaviours not program related and \\nattitudes such as: “I’m not interested, I don’t think the same was as other people, I \\nhave to have interest and feelings for the work, program will do nothing for me, I \\nwant nothing to do with nothing, I don’t want to be here.  I don’t want to \\nunderstand etc.”  Despite motivational techniques his presentations in the first part \\nof the program noted the aforementioned.  In the second part of the program his \\npresentations changed dramatically to include engagement, eye contact, verbal \\nparticipation, trying to complete homework assignments.  The latter part of the \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 24 \\n \\n \\nprogram near the finish his engagement reverted back to his previous \\ndisengagement, I don’t care attitude, I have disabilities, I can’t do \\nprogram/homework which may be due to separation from the program and \\nongoing responsivity challenges.  It is noted that his responsivity challenges noted \\nare complex and variable with primary emotional as well as physical impairments.  \\nTo his credit he did present as meaningfully engagement mid to end of program \\nwhich is seen as a positive. \\n. . . \\nAt the end of the program, Mr. Hamelin’s rated ability/commitment to use the \\nskills to solve problems and challenges effectively is maintained as Needs a lot of \\nImprovement based on pre and post rates. \\n. . . \\n… Based on the analysis of each of Mr. Hamelin’s personal targets, it is \\ndetermined that his current overall ability and commitment to use the skills \\nrequired to manage his various risk factors is assessed as unchanged to Needs a \\nlot of Improvement deferring to the lowest rating.  He did show some promise \\nmid program when his mood was good and his relationship was good, but overall \\nhe remains a requiring a high level of proficiency in his understanding and \\napplication.  He is credited with getting out of the halfway house, finding \\nrewarding activities and accessing some community supports to support his \\nfreedom and personal control quadrant.  Overall lifestyle balance in all areas is \\nencouraged.  He is also credited with his participation in program which allows \\nfor the possibility of some information gain with the hope of moving to an \\nimproved stage of change.  Mid program he showed happier emotions, confidence \\nand engagement; however, his retention and internalization of his concepts \\nintroduced is undetermined.  Post program, he reverted to his disengaged, all or \\nnothing attitude of not needing the program, not wanting to learn anything.  His \\nmental health and physical health challenges will be an ongoing variable effecting \\nhis achievements towards positive change.” \\n[170]  \\nFinally, on this point, Dr. Gray noted: \\n“I note the last note in the Casework record was by a correctional program officer \\non February 15, 2019. She contacted him to meet and review his self-management \\nplans prior to the expiration of his LTSO on February 18. She wrote that Mr. \\nHamelin declined the meeting, \\n\"stating that he could not see any benefits to such meeting and that \\nhe is \\'not even remotely interested\\' in meeting for this purpose. He \\noffered he has \\'everything figured out\\' and he is prepared for all \\naspect of reintegration. He offered that he does not need any help \\nor suggestions on how to manage effectively his risk factors as he \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 25 \\n \\n \\nopined he does not \\'have any risk factors in the community\\' and he \\nhas \\'everything lined up\\' for success including a place to stay and a \\njob\".” \\n[171]  \\nDespite the brief success at not reoffending while at Henry Trail while subject to \\nclose supervision, the index offences were committed within 9 months of the expiration of his \\nLTSO. \\nMr. Hamelin Addressed the Court \\n[172]  \\nFollowing counsel submissions on February 5, 2024, Mr. Hamelin addressed the \\nCourt.  He said that he was sorry for causing emotional hurt and embarrassment to AB and HN.  \\nHe said he didn’t want that to happen again, and that he was wrong.  He said he was sorry and that \\nhe needed help. \\nApplicable Legal Principles \\n[173]  \\nIn her decision in R. v. Medford, 2019 ONSC 5065, Justice Molloy sets out the legal \\nprinciples governing the dangerous offender legislation as follows: \\n8  In R. v. Boutilier, the Supreme Court of Canada described the dangerous \\noffender regime as a \"two-stage\" process, with the first stage being a \\nconsideration of whether the offender meets the criteria under s. 753(1) of \\nthe Criminal Code for designation as a dangerous offender (the designation \\nstage), and the second stage involving a determination of what sentence to impose \\nunder s. 753 (4) and (4.1) of the Code (the penalty stage).  \\n9  Thus, a finding that an offender meets one of the four criteria for designation as \\na dangerous offender is only the first stage of the analysis. The dangerous \\noffender designation is one of the most onerous sentences that can be imposed in \\nour criminal justice system. It involves imposing a sentence of an indeterminate \\nlength, the actual length of imprisonment being dependent upon review by the \\nNational Parole Board. The first review is at seven years and reviews are then \\nconducted every two years thereafter. The offender will only be released if the \\nParole Board is satisfied that the risk he represents can be controlled in the \\ncommunity. The indeterminate nature of the sentence could, in theory, mean the \\noffender is incarcerated for the rest of his natural life. Because this is a severe \\nsentence, its imposition does not follow merely because specified criteria are met. \\nThe sentencing judge must not make such a designation if a lesser penalty would \\nstill satisfy the general principles and objectives of sentencing, including \\nprotection of the public and whether it is possible to impose a less restrictive \\nsentence that would still satisfy the other objectives of sentencing.  \\n10  Upon finding at the first stage that an offender meets one or more of the \\nrequirements for a dangerous offender designation, the sentencing judge has three \\noptions, as set out in s. 753(4) as follows: \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 26 \\n \\n \\nIf the court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender, it shall \\n(a) impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate \\nperiod; \\n(b) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been \\nconvicted -- which must be a minimum punishment of imprisonment \\nfor a term of two years -- and order that the offender be subject to \\nlong-term supervision for a period that does not exceed 10 years; or \\n(c) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been \\nconvicted. \\n11  However, option (c) (a regular determinate sentence) and option (b) (a long-\\nterm offender designation) cannot be imposed unless the evidence establishes a \\nreasonable expectation that such a sentence will adequately protect the public. \\nSection 753(4.1) states: \\nThe court shall impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for \\nan indeterminate period unless it is satisfied by the evidence \\nadduced during the hearing of the application that there is a \\nreasonable expectation that a lesser measure under paragraph \\n(4)(b) or (c) will adequately protect the public against the \\ncommission by the offender of murder or a serious personal injury \\noffence. \\n12  The Supreme Court of Canada considered the constitutionality of the \\ndangerous offender provisions of the Criminal Code in its landmark decision in R. \\nv. Lyons,  and recently (in Boutilier) revisited and affirmed its conclusions \\nin Lyons. \\n13  In Lyons, and again in Boutilier, the Supreme Court held that there are four \\ncriteria for the dangerous offender designation: (1) a conviction for a serious \\npersonal injury offence (which is an objective test); (2) evidence of a broader \\npattern of violence beyond the predicate offence; (3) a high likelihood of harmful \\nrecidivism; and (4) a requirement that the pattern of conduct is substantially or \\npathologically intractable.  Of these, the last two criteria are forward looking, the \\nissue being the future risk represented by the offender.  \\n14  The burden is on the Crown to establish that the dangerous offender criteria \\nhave been met and that an indeterminate sentence should be imposed. The criteria \\nmust be established beyond a reasonable doubt, including the requirement of the \\nlikelihood of reoffending in the future. Predicting the future can never be an \\nexercise of certainty. The Supreme Court in Lyons dealt with this apparent \\nconundrum as follows: \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 27 \\n \\n \\n. . . However, as Holmes has reminded us, the life of the law has \\nnot been logic: it has been experience. The criminal law must \\noperate in a world governed by practical considerations rather than \\nabstract logic and, as a matter of practicality, the most that can be \\nestablished in a future context is a likelihood of certain events \\noccurring. To doubt this conclusion is, in actuality, to doubt the \\nvalidity of the legislative objectives embodied in Part XXI, for to \\nrequire certainty in such matters would be tantamount to rendering \\nthe entire process ineffective. \\nMoreover, I am not convinced, even as a matter of logic, that the \\nappellant\\'s submission is sound. It seems to me that a \"likelihood\" \\nof specified future conduct occurring is the finding of fact required \\nto be established; it is not, at one and the same time, the means of \\nproving that fact. Logically, it seems clear to me that an individual \\ncan be found to constitute a threat to society without insisting that \\nthis require the court to assert an ability to predict the future. I do \\nnot find it illogical for a court to assert that it is satisfied beyond a \\nreasonable doubt that the test of dangerousness has been met, that \\nthere exists a certain potential for harm. That this is really only an \\napparent paradox is aptly captured by Morden J. in R. v. \\nKnight (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 343 (Ont. H.C.), at p. 356 : \\nI wish to make it clear that when I refer to the requisite \\nstandard of proof respecting likelihood I am not imposing \\non myself an obligation to find it proven beyond a \\nreasonable doubt that certain events will happen in the \\nfuture--this, in the nature of things would be impossible in \\npractically every case --but I do refer to the quality and \\nstrength of the evidence of past and present facts together \\nwith the expert opinion thereon, as an existing basis for \\nfinding present likelihood of future conduct.  \\n15  In a more recent decision, Code J. described the \"likelihood\" analysis in the \\nfollowing terms, which I adopt: \\nThe one difficult issue, in relation to the s. 753(1)(a) and (b) \\nstatutory tests, is whether the requisite \"likelihood\" of re-offending \\nin the future has been established. Predicting future conduct is \\nnotoriously difficult and the exact meaning of the s. 753 \\n\"likelihood\" test is subtle. The ordinary dictionary meaning of the \\nword \"likelihood\", as well as its normal legal usage, is \\n\"probability\", that is, something more than mere \"possibility\". See: \\nThe New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University \\nPress 1993, Vol. 1, p. 1588; Black\\'s Law Dictionary, 9th Ed. 2009, \\nat p. 1012; D.A. Dukelow, Dictionary of Canadian Law, 3rd Ed. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 28 \\n \\n \\n2004, at p. 723; R. v. H. (J.T.), 2002 NSCA 138, 170 C.C.C. (3d) \\n405 at paras. 68-75 and 101-4 (N.S.C.A.). When applying this \\nmeaning to the \"likelihood\" test found in s. 753, the courts have \\nstressed that it refers to probable \"risk\" or \"potential for harm\", as a \\npresent fact, rather than to proof of a future event which would be \\nan impossibility.  \\n16  The Supreme Court in Boutilier defined \"intractable\" conduct as \"behavior \\nthat the offender is unable to surmount.\"  As already stated, this is a prospective \\nanalysis. Rather than merely looking at whether the offender\\'s conduct has been \\nintractable in the past, the sentencing judge must be satisfied that this will be the \\ncase into the future. \\n17  Expert psychiatric evidence is of invaluable assistance to the sentencing judge \\nin making decisions under the dangerous and long-term offender provisions of \\nthe Criminal Code. Indeed, at the initiation of the process, an assessment by a \\npsychiatrist is mandated. However, ultimately the decision as to whether the \\ncriteria have been met, and whether the designation should be made, rests with the \\ntrial judge. If the psychiatrist expresses an opinion one way or the other on any of \\nthe criteria (e.g. degree of future risk), that opinion is not binding on the trial \\njudge. In this regard, I repeat what I wrote in an earlier case, as follows: \\nIn determining the likelihood of risk of reoffence and the \\npossibility of controlling that risk in the community, it is relevant \\nfor the judge to take into account the expert opinion evidence of \\npsychiatrists: R. v. Lyons at paras. 97-100. That is not to say that \\nthe trial judge is bound to accept the opinion of one psychiatrist or \\nthe other, but rather that the expert evidence is relevant to the \\njudge\\'s inquiry, with determinations as to the weight and reliability \\nof that evidence left to the judge: R. v. Currie, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 260. \\nIn this regard, the Supreme Court in R. v. Lyons referred with \\napproval (at para 98) to the following \"common sense \\nobservations\" of Ewaschuk J. in Re Moore (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) \\n306 (Ont.H.C.) at 310-311: \\nI accept the submission that the evidence of a psychiatrist, \\npsychologist or criminologist is at times highly speculative \\nand in certain instances a lay person is in as good a position \\nto make a prediction as to future dangerousness. In the final \\nsay, the court, however, must be so satisfied and not the \\nexpert witnesses. That is not to say that the experts may not \\nassist the court, especially as to whether the offender \\ncurrently suffers from a psychological \\ndisorder,  e.g.  psychopathy, which may be relevant to the \\nlikelihood of future dangerous conduct. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 29 \\n \\n \\n18  The overarching purpose of the dangerous offender provisions is the \\nprotection of society from the risk presented by violent offenders at risk of \\nreoffending. As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Jones: \\n. . . The overriding aim is not the punishment of the offender but \\nthe prevention of future violence through the imposition of an \\nindeterminate sentence. An indeterminate sentence is not an \\nunlimited sentence. If, in the case at hand, the psychiatrists \\ntestifying on behalf of the accused are correct in their assessment \\nthat Mr. Jones will be fit to be released in ten years, then he will be \\nliberated at that time. The offender faces incarceration only for the \\nperiod of time that he poses a serious risk to the safety of society. \\nIn the interim, it is hoped that he will receive treatment that will \\nassist him in controlling his conduct. To release a dangerous \\noffender while he remains unable to control his actions serves \\nneither the interests of the offender nor those of society.  \\n[Emphasis added] \\n19  Although an indeterminate sentence may seem harsh, if it is required in order \\nto protect society, then it should be imposed. The Ontario Court of Appeal held \\nin R. v. G.L.: \\nAs I have indicated, the overriding purpose of the dangerous and \\nlong-term offender regimes is the protection of the public. Thus, \\n\"real world\" resourcing limitations cannot be ignored or minimized \\nwhere to do so would endanger public safety. The court is required \\non a dangerous offender application to balance the liberty interests \\nof an accused with the risk to public safety that will arise on the \\nrelease of the accused into the community. That balancing exercise \\nis informed by this fundamental principle: in a contest between an \\nindividual offender\\'s interest in invoking the long-term offender \\nprovisions of the Code and the protection of the public, the latter \\nmust prevail. This accords, in my opinion, with the intention of \\nParliament as expressed in the dangerous and long-term offender \\nprovisions of the Code, and in the Corrections and Conditional \\nRelease Act.  \\n[Emphasis added] \\n[174]  \\nIn R. v. Boutilier, 2017 SCC 64, the Court states: \\n13  The dangerous offender scheme is designed as a \"two stage\" process. \\n14  Section 753(1) lists the statutory requirements that must be met before a court \\ncan designate an offender as dangerous (\"designation stage\"): \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 30 \\n \\n \\n753 (1) On application made under this Part after an assessment \\nreport is filed under subsection 752.1(2), the court shall find the \\noffender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied \\n(a) that the offence for which the offender has been \\nconvicted is a serious personal injury offence described in \\nparagraph (a) of the definition of that expression in section \\n752 and the offender constitutes a [page950] threat to the \\nlife, safety or physical or mental well-being of other \\npersons on the basis of evidence establishing \\n(i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, \\nof which the offence for which he or she has been \\nconvicted forms a part, showing a failure to restrain \\nhis or her behaviour and a likelihood of causing \\ndeath or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe \\npsychological damage on other persons, through \\nfailure in the future to restrain his or her behaviour, \\n. . . \\n15  Subsections (4) and (4.1) of s. 753 relate to the sentencing of a dangerous \\noffender (\"penalty stage\"): \\n(4) If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender, it \\nshall \\n(a) impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an \\nindeterminate period; \\n(b) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has \\nbeen convicted - which must be a minimum punishment of \\nimprisonment for a term of two years - and order that the offender \\nbe subject to long-term supervision for a period that does not \\nexceed 10 years; or \\n(c) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has \\nbeen convicted. \\n[175]  \\nWith respect to the Designation Stage, the court states: \\n17  The Crown must demonstrate two elements to obtain a designation of \\ndangerousness resulting from violent behaviour. First, the offence for which the \\noffender has been convicted must be \"a serious personal injury offence\": s. \\n753(1)(a). This first criterion is objective. There is no room for judicial discretion, \\nsince s. 752 defines the list of serious personal injury offences. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 31 \\n \\n \\n18  Second, the offender must represent \"a threat to the life, safety or physical or \\nmental well-being of other persons\". This second element, the requisite threat \\nlevel, requires that the judge evaluate the threat posed by the offender on the basis \\nof evidence establishing one of the following three violent patterns of conduct: \\n(i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the \\noffence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, \\nshowing a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a likelihood \\nof causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe \\npsychological damage on other persons, through failure in the \\nfuture to restrain his or her behaviour, \\n. . . \\n[176]  \\nThe court continued,  \\n26  In Lyons, Justice La Forest read the objective element of the designation - the \\nrequirement that the predicate offence be a \"serious personal injury offence\" - \\ntogether with the subjective element - the \"threat\" assessment - and concluded that \\nfour criteria were \"explicit\" from the language of s. 753(1): (1) the offender has \\nbeen convicted of, and has to be sentenced for, a \"serious personal injury \\noffence\"; (2) this predicate offence is part of a [page955] broader pattern of \\nviolence; (3) there is a high likelihood of harmful recidivism; and (4) the violent \\nconduct is intractable (p. 338). The last three criteria are part of the assessment of \\nthe \"threat\" posed by the offender. The last two of these are future-oriented, and \\nJustice La Forest explained them as follows: \\nThirdly, it must be established that the pattern of conduct is very \\nlikely to continue and to result in the kind of suffering against \\nwhich the section seeks to protect, namely, conduct endangering \\nthe life, safety or physical well-being of others or, in the case of \\nsexual offences, conduct causing injury, pain or other evil to other \\npersons. Also explicit in one form or another in each subparagraph \\nof s. [688, now 753] is the requirement that the court must be \\nsatisfied that the pattern of conduct is substantially or \\npathologically intractable. [Emphasis added] \\n27  … Before designating a dangerous offender, a sentencing judge must still be \\nsatisfied on the evidence that the offender poses a high likelihood of harmful \\nrecidivism and that his or her conduct is intractable. I understand \"intractable\" \\nconduct as meaning behaviour that the offender is unable to surmount. Through \\nthese two criteria, Parliament requires sentencing judges to conduct a prospective \\nassessment of dangerousness. \\n. . . \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 32 \\n \\n \\n[177]  \\nOf particular relevance to Mr. Hamelin’s counsel’s submissions in this case, is the \\ncourt’s comments as follows: \\n31  I respectfully disagree with this conclusion. As I will discuss below, the \\npurposes of prospective evidence at the designation and sentencing stages are \\ndifferent. The designation stage is concerned with assessing the future threat \\nposed by an offender. The penalty stage is concerned with imposing the \\nappropriate sentence to manage the established threat. Though evidence may \\nestablish that an offender is unable to surmount his or her violent conduct, the \\nsentencing judge must, at the penalty stage, turn his or her mind to whether the \\nrisk arising from the offender\\'s behaviour can be adequately managed outside of \\nan indeterminate sentence. \\n. . . \\n45  The same prospective evidence of treatability plays a different role at the \\ndifferent stages of the judge\\'s decision-making process. At the designation stage, \\ntreatability informs the decision on the threat posed by an offender, whereas at the \\npenalty stage, it helps determine the appropriate sentence to manage this threat. \\nThus, offenders will not be designated as dangerous if their treatment prospects \\nare so compelling that the sentencing judge cannot conclude beyond a reasonable \\ndoubt that they present a high likelihood of harmful recidivism or that their \\nviolent pattern is intractable. However, even where the treatment prospects are not \\ncompelling enough to affect the judge\\'s conclusion on dangerousness, they will \\nstill be relevant in choosing the sentence required to adequately protect the public. \\n46  In sum, a finding of dangerousness has always required that the Crown \\ndemonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, a high likelihood of harmful recidivism \\nand the intractability of the violent pattern of conduct. A prospective assessment \\nof dangerousness ensures that only offenders who pose a tremendous future risk \\nare designated as dangerous and face the possibility of being sentenced to an \\nindeterminate detention. This necessarily involves the consideration of future \\ntreatment prospects. … \\nAnalysis \\nDesignation Stage \\nSerious Personal Injury Offence \\n[178]  \\nAt this first stage, the burden of proof on the Crown is proof beyond a reasonable \\ndoubt. \\n[179]  \\nThe first step in determining whether Mr. Hamelin meets the criteria for designation \\nas a dangerous offender is to consider whether he has committed a “serious personal injury \\noffence”.  Section 752 of the Criminal Code defines “serious personal injury offence,” so far as is \\nrelevant to Mr. Hamelin\\'s case, as an indictable offence involving conduct “likely to inflict severe \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 33 \\n \\n \\npsychological damage on another person, and for which the offender may be sentenced to \\nimprisonment for 10 years or more.” \\n[180]  \\nDefence counsel for Mr. Hamelin does not strongly dispute that the criminal \\nharassment against HN meets the definition of a serious personal injury offence. \\n[181]  \\nJustice Meijers in sentencing Mr. Hamelin on November 28, 2014, found that the \\ncriminal harassment against AB, Mr. Hamelin’s prior victim, amounted to a serious personal injury \\noffence.  Justice Meijers stated, “It affects the very structure of their lives.  It affects their living \\narrangements.  It affects their family.  It affects their jobs (and in the case of HN, her volunteer \\nwork).  It affects how they interact with other people, people they haven’t met, and increases \\nsuspicion and makes them live in fear, and brings fear and uncertainty to all aspects of their life.” \\n[182]  \\nIn the proceedings before me, a further victim impact statement written by AB was \\nfiled on consent, Ex. 8, further attesting to the severe psychological damage that Mr. Hamelin’s \\nconduct inflicted upon her. \\n[183]  \\nIn R. v. Cook, 2020 ONCA 809, the court upheld the trial decision which found that \\nthe criminal harassment in that case constituted a serious personal injury offence and that the \\nCrown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the criteria for a dangerous offender designation \\nbecause the appellant’s pattern of conduct showed a failure to restrain his behaviour, and a \\nlikelihood that he would cause severe psychological damage in the future. (The same basis as is \\nadvanced in Mr. Hamelin\\'s case).  The court upheld the trial judge’s findings that the appellant’s \\nconduct interfered significantly with the victim’s personal life and well-being and actually caused \\nsevere psychological damage to her.  The trial judge found that the appellant’s conduct placed it \\nwell beyond trivial or de minimis and that the appellant substantially interfered with the victim’s \\npsychological integrity, health or well-being. \\n[184]  \\nTo the same effect is the court’s decision in R. v. Cook, 2013 ONCA 467, in \\nparticular, at para. 42. \\n[185]  \\nOn the basis of the facts in this case of Mr. Hamelin, I have no hesitation in finding \\nthat the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that his criminal harassment against HN \\nfalls within the definition of a serious personal injury offence.  HN’s victim impact statement was \\nfiled on consent.  An offer by the Crown to cross-examine her on it was declined by defence.  HN’s \\nstatement makes it clear beyond any doubt that he inflicted severe psychological damage upon her. \\n[186]  \\nThe facts of this case together with the victim impact statement demonstrate \\nconduct communicating with, defaming his victim, causing her to fear greatly for her safety and \\nthe safety of her children and the safety of her home and personal property.  The criminal \\nharassment persisted beyond the point of Mr. Hamelin’s arrest and incarceration.  Clearly, the \\noffence inflicted and was reasonably and expectedly likely to inflict, severe psychological damage \\nto HN.  She suffered a profound negative psychological impact on her life, the lives of her children \\nand all that she had worked for to achieve.  His actions were profoundly devastating to her and can \\nreasonably be expected to continue to negatively impact her life in a significant way. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 34 \\n \\n \\n[187]  \\nDr. Gray’s evidence supports a finding of severe psychological damage inflicted, \\nand likely to be, inflicted on HN. \\n[188]  \\nI find that Mr. Hamelin’s criminal harassment of HN interfered in a substantial way \\nwith the psychological integrity, health and well-being of HN.  The harm he caused her impaired \\nher health and her normal function as a person.  It continues to do so.  The harm that he caused to \\nher was more than trivial or de minimis by far. \\n[189]  \\nI find that Mr. Hamelin’s criminal harassment did, in fact, inflict severe \\npsychological damage on HN, and was likely to inflict serious psychological damage upon her or \\nany other person subjected to it.  (Cook, 2020, para. 18, 19; R. v S.M. [2005] O.J. No 1041 (Ont. \\nC.A.), para. 13, 14; R. v. Tremblay, 2010 ONSC 486, para. 74-76). \\n[190]  \\nAccordingly, the first step in the analysis namely that the Crown has proven beyond \\na reasonable doubt that Mr. Hamelin committed a serious personal injury offence has been met. \\nA Threat to Mental Well Being \\n[191]  \\nJustice Molloy states that the next step in the Designation Stage is to determine, \\nunder s. 753(1), whether Mr. Hamelin “constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental \\nwell-being of other persons, based on evidence,” so far as is relevant to Mr. Hamelin’s case, \\n“establishing a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he \\nor she has been convicted forms a part, showing a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a \\nlikelihood of … inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons through failure in the \\nfuture to restrain his or her behaviour.”  \\n[192]  \\nThe burden on the Crown is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \\nPattern of Repetitive Behaviour \\n[193]  \\nIn his submissions, defence counsel acknowledged that the pattern criteria has been \\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to HN. \\n[194]  \\nI agree. \\n[195]  \\nJustice Meijers made that finding in respect of the criminal harassment of A.B.  He \\nfound that: \\n16  Mr. Hamelin … has demonstrated a clear pattern and propensity towards this \\ntype of behaviour. He has been undeterred in the past in his harassing behaviour \\nby interaction and intervention by the police or by court intervention. None of \\nthese have seem to have significantly control or deterred Mr. Hamelin from \\ncontinuing to contact those people he clearly ought to know do not want his \\ncontact and whose lives he is greatly affecting, in whom he\\'s causing a great deal \\nof fear to erupt because of that behaviour. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 35 \\n \\n \\n17  This count of criminal harassment to which he\\'s pleaded guilty is his fifth. It \\nwas committed while he was on two probation orders, each would appear related \\nto the same victim. \\n18  In my view, given this history, given this pattern, given the repeated and \\nundeterred behaviour on the part of Mr. Hamelin …  \\n[196]  \\nThe pattern continued with respect to HN and, in fact, escalated as noted by Dr. \\nGray, and continued during the first 3 months that he was in jail. \\n[197]  \\nDr. Gray identified and commented on the evidence of Mr. Hamelin’s pattern of \\nrepetitive behaviour as follows: \\n“Most of Mr. Hamelin\\'s offences have been directed towards ex-partners. This \\nincludes his 2002 offences directed against CP, his offences in 2010, 2011 \\n(twice), 2012, 2013, and 2014 directed against AB, and his index offences \\ndirected against HN. All of those offences, except the 2010 mischief offence, \\ninvolved repeated, unwanted contact with an ex-partner despite legal prohibitions \\nagainst doing so. The contact took the form of text messages, voice messages, and \\nFacebook posts. \\nThere is substantial evidence that he is unable to restrain his actions forming the \\nbasis of his offending behaviour. As noted, he has repeatedly contacted ex-\\npartners against their clear, stated wishes and legal prohibitions. Even in the face \\nof potential incarceration, he has continued to attempt to communicate with them. \\nFurther evidence of his inability to restrain his actions has been his persisting in \\nthe behaviour after hospitalization or even incarceration in many instances. He \\nsent over a dozen letters to AB while receiving treatment, and incarcerated, at \\nSLVCI, resulting in more time in custody. He contacted HN from Quinte \\nDetention Centre by misleading a correctional officer to send her a message on \\nhis behalf. \\nHis response to legal sanction for the repeated, unwanted communication has \\nalmost always been denial that he contacted them at all, an evasion of \\nresponsibility that portends the behaviour will continue. \\nThere are strong indications the pattern of behaviour will continue in the future. \\nMr. Hamelin has had several rounds of treatment on partner violence and anger \\nmanagement. He completed several groups as an inpatient at SLVCI to address \\nissues relevant to his behaviour. Despite these interventions, his index offence \\ninvolved elements of his usual pattern, demonstrating a lack of effectiveness of \\nany treatment he had thus far.” \\n(Emphasis added) \\n[198]  \\nDr. Gray continued: \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 36 \\n \\n \\n“With AB, while most of the unwanted contact took the form of pleas to resume \\nthe relationship or bizarre messages disguised as coming from someone else, he \\npersisted in his offending for years. The behaviour continued after six sets of \\noffences spanning four years, and included persistent contact from jails. The \\nlength of time and persistence of unwanted contact, despite criminal sanction, \\nprovides evidence of an escalation of the severity of his conduct beyond that \\nexhibited in 2002. \\nIn the index offences, the escalation included more abusive, degrading and \\nthreatening unwanted contact towards HN. This included, for the first time, \\nexplicit threats. In contrast to his past actions, in my opinion, his index behaviour \\nwould more certainly cause fear and anguish in his victim. Indeed, in interview he \\nadmitted that was his intention, in order to cause her to feel the same pain he did \\nfor being \"betrayed\". Unlike with AB, who he repeatedly stated he loved and \\nwanted to reconcile the relationship, his stated intention in the index offences was \\nvengeance out of anger. \\nAs noted above, there is a psychiatric basis to the pattern of behaviour. A history \\nof repeated, stormy relationships and dramatic break-ups is one of the essential \\nfeatures of BPD. His impulsivity and explosive anger, fuelling the behaviour, is \\nanother aspect of BPD. His frontal lobe damage likely worsens these traits and \\nmay make them more enduring.” \\n(Emphasis added) \\n[199]  \\nThe Court of Appeal in Cook 2020 agreed that conduct similar to that of Mr. \\nHamelin’s met the pattern of repetitive behaviour criteria. (para. 24). \\n[200]  \\nI find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hamelin’s \\ncriminal harassment of HN constitutes a continuing pattern of repetitive behaviour showing a \\nfailure to restrain his behaviour. \\nFuture Risk and Intractability \\n[201]  \\nOn this criteria of the designation stage, Justice Molloy said, in Medford: \\n94  The next stage of the analysis is forward looking. The Crown must establish \\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that there is a high likelihood that Mr. Medford will \\nreoffend in a harmful way and that the pattern of conduct he has demonstrated to \\ndate is substantially or pathologically intractable. Although these are separate \\nconcepts, they are related in that a finding that a pattern of violent conduct is \\nintractable leads logically to a conclusion as to the likelihood of recidivism. The \\nissue at this stage, however, is not what Mr. Medford has already done, but rather \\nwhat the risks are for the future. \\n. . . \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 37 \\n \\n \\n97  The expert evidence is also a factor to be taken into account. Again, it is not \\nnecessarily conclusive. I cannot simply disregard the evidence, but neither am I \\nbound by it. It is a factor to be considered.  \\n[202]  \\nIn R. v. Groves, 2020 ONCA 86, the court said that the trial judge was required to \\nreview the appellant’s prior conduct for the purposes of assessing future risk. It said: \\n6  … the nature and duration of the appellant\\'s prior conduct provided powerful \\nevidence of how the appellant would act in the future, if given the opportunity. \\nThe evidence of the appellant\\'s prior conduct was strongly suggestive of a \\nsignificant future risk. \\n[203]  \\nThe trial judge in that case also considered the recent assessment which spoke \\ndirectly to the future risk. \\n[204]  \\nDr. Gray’s observations and opinion on Mr. Hamelin’s past conduct and future risk \\nare highly relevant.  In addition to his evidence which I summarized previously and which I quoted \\nat paragraphs 197 and 198 above, he says,  \\nThere are strong indications the pattern of behaviour will continue in the future.  \\nMr. Hamelin has had several rounds of treatment on partner violence and anger \\nmanagement.  He completed several groups as an in patient at SLVCI to address \\nissues relevant to his behaviour.  Despite these interventions, this index offence \\ninvolved elements of his usual pattern, demonstrating a lack of effectiveness of \\nany treatment he had thus far.   \\nAnother indication that he will be unable to restrain himself in the future is the \\nunderlying, psychiatric basis of his behavioural patterns. Personality disorders \\nare by their nature fixed, and not \"curable\". Traits of the disorder can be managed \\nto a degree with medications or therapy, but remain present. Unlike, for example, \\nschizophrenia, symptoms of which can be held in sustained remission with \\ncompliance with medications, personality disorder persist to a degree despite \\nmedications and therapy. As will be explained below, sufferers of BPD tend to \\n\"burn out\", with a blunting of their more impulsive and violent tendencies as they \\nage into their late 40s and 50s.  However, I note that Mr. Hamelin\\'s BPD traits are \\nreinforced by his pattern of brain damage in the very area of deficit for those with \\nBPD, the frontal lobes. It is thus uncertain if his BPD traits will blunt at the same \\nage, and to the same degree, as someone without organic brain damage. \\n. . . \\nWith AB, while most of the unwanted contact took the form of pleas to resume \\nthe relationship or bizarre messages disguised as coming from someone else, he \\npersisted in his offending for years. The behaviour continued after six sets of \\noffences spanning four years, and included persistent contact from jails. The \\nlength of time and persistence of unwanted contact, despite criminal sanction, \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 38 \\n \\n \\nprovides evidence of an escalation of the severity of his conduct beyond that \\nexhibited in 2002. \\nIn the index offences, the escalation included more abusive, degrading and \\nthreatening unwanted contact towards HN. This included, for the first time, \\nexplicit threats. In contrast to his past actions, in my opinion, his index behaviour \\nwould more certainly caused fear and anguish in his victim. Indeed, in interview \\nhe admitted that was his intention, in order to cause her to feel the same pain he \\ndid for being \"betrayed\". Unlike with AB, who he repeatedly stated he loved and \\nwanted to reconcile the relationship, his stated intention in the index offences was \\nvengeance out of anger. \\nAs noted above, there is a psychiatric basis to the pattern of behaviour. A history \\nof repeated, stormy relationships and dramatic break-ups is one of the essential \\nfeatures of BPD.  \\n. . . \\nIs there a high likelihood of recidivism? \\n. . . \\nMr. Hamelin suffers from two conditions that act synergistically to render him at \\na high risk of continuing his pattern of repeated, unwanted contact with ex-\\npartners. Both BPD, and his history of frontal lobe damage, render him highly \\nimpulsive, subject to rapid variations in mood, and impair his ability to maintain \\nhealthy relationships and more importantly, deal with a partner leaving him. \\nHis behaviour goes beyond what is typical of someone suffering from BPD. In a \\ntypical case of an individual suffering from BPD, there are multiple visits to \\nhospital emergency rooms with suicidal gestures or threats, and a history of many \\ndysfunctional relationships. It is less common that the degree of dysfunction in \\nrelationships leads to criminal charges, let alone repeated criminal charges over \\nseveral partners and despite the deterrent effect of legal sanction and \\nincarceration. \\nThe persistence of the behaviour over time, partners, and severe consequences \\nsuggests a high risk it will persist in the future. Factors alluded to above, the \\npresence of a personality disorder and organic brain damage, suggest the risk \\nwill continue in the future. \\nThe lack of apparent amenability to treatment is another factor suggesting the \\nrisk in the future of similar behaviour will be high. \\nAs alluded to above, in the typical clinical course of BPD, more acute personality \\ntraits soften and blunt with age. More commonly, those with BPD are less \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 39 \\n \\n \\nimpulsive, and engage in less suicidal threats and self-injurious behaviour as they \\nreach their late 40s and 50s. \\nMr. Hamelin, at the age of 42, is approaching the age at which this \"burnout\" \\ntrend would generally begin. However, two factors suggest his individual case \\nmay not follow the commonly-observed clinical trend. \\nHis most serious instances of problematic behaviour stemming from BPD were \\nhis most recent against the index victim. One would have expected, in a typical \\nclinical course for BPD, that there would be more persistent behaviour in his 20s, \\nwith a downward trend into his 40s. The opposite appears to be the case. \\nSecondly, as mentioned in several places above in this report, his 1997 head \\ninjury would certainly not have modulated traits of BPD. More likely, it would \\nworsen BPD traits and may cause them to persist beyond the \"burnout\" period. \\nFinally, I note that while Mr. Hamelin stated in interview that he is not interested \\nin another relationship again, and he wants to just focus on his children, he has \\nmade the same declaration in the past at the end of his relationship with AB. It is \\nin my opinion highly likely that at some point in the future, he will be involved in \\nanother relationship. Almost inevitably, given his past pattern, this relationship \\nwill eventually dissolve. Given most of his past romantic relationships ended in \\nrepeated unwanted contact, including two for which he was not charged, it is \\nalmost inevitable this pattern will continue. \\nNotwithstanding this high risk of repeated unwanted contact with ex-partners, \\nwhich has a high likelihood to cause psychological harm, in my opinion his risk of \\ncommitting an act of physical aggression is low. \\n. . . \\nIs Mr. Hamelin’s behaviour “intractable”? \\nI am aware that the concept of \"intractable\" behaviour is a legal, and not \\npsychiatric, issue. It is up to the Court to decide on the issue of intractability. \\nWhat follows is psychiatric evidence on the issues of the chronicity of his risk \\nfactors, the likelihood of his risk level changing over time, and the treatability of \\nrisk. My psychiatric opinions on these issues may assist the Court in making this \\nlegal determination. \\n. . . \\nMr. Hamelin has exhibited a similar pattern of behaviour over many different \\nrelationships over a period of almost 20 years. The behaviour has persisted \\ndespite repeated legal sanction, and even persisted while he was incarcerated. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 40 \\n \\n \\nHe has participated in several rounds of treatment, and has been noted for the \\nmost part to be uninterested and lacking insight when in programs. In the end, all \\nof his previous treatment interventions have not reduced the intensity or \\npersistence of his criminal behaviour. \\nAs noted above, his head injury, and underlying personality disorder, are fixed \\nconditions that are more resistant to change than a mental disorder due to a \\nchemical imbalance. This testifies to the fixity of factors motivating his offending \\nbehaviour, and the likelihood future treatment has a lower chance of success. \\nAnother factor is his complete denial of much of his offending behaviour, and \\nrecurrent perception of himself as the victim in his offences. This tendency lessens \\nthe chance that he will be receptive to treatment in the future, and also suggests \\nthat he will continue to see future similar behaviour as justified and lack remorse \\nfor the effects his behaviour will have on his victims. \\nIn my opinion, although Mr. Hamelin has hearing deficits and some cognitive \\nchallenges, these issues are not the main reason for the lack of effectiveness in \\ntreatment interventions. My reading of his past health records is that \\naccommodations for his responsivity issues were made in most instances, and \\nfacilitators noted he understood the material in theory. The problem instead was \\nthat he did not think his various treatment interventions were relevant to his \\nsituation, and did not see himself to have problems that needed fixing. Therefore, \\nmore accommodations to address responsivity issues in the future are unlikely to \\nresult in greater treatment success. It is doubtful that his underlying traits and \\nbehaviours will change. \\nI also noted above the lack of evidence, or at least uncertainty, that the general \\ntrend of dysfunctional traits \"burning out\" with age will apply to Mr. Hamelin. \\nThis psychiatric evidence suggests \"intractability\" as well. \\nIn summary, it is my opinion that there is abundant psychiatric evidence to \\nsupport the legal question of Mr. Hamelin\\'s risk being considered \"intractable\". \\nHe is highly unlikely to develop the internal controls with time and treatment, for \\nhim to manage his offending behaviours.” \\n(Emphasis added) \\n[205]  \\nOn the evidence, Dr. Gray’s clinical opinion is supported by the HCR-20-Version \\n3 actuarial tool results, although he acknowledges that there is no actuarial tool designed \\nspecifically for Mr. Hamelin’s characteristics of offending. \\n[206]  \\nAs Justice Molloy cited: \\n101  In R. v. Gibson, Code J. held that a denial of the underlying offences and a \\nfailure to recognize any basis for treatment are relevant to the assessment of \\nrecidivism and dangerousness.  Code J. stated (at paras. 45 and 47): \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 41 \\n \\n \\nThe dangerous offender jurisprudence is consistent with the above \\nproposition drawn from Levert, which was not a dangerous \\noffender case. The Courts have repeatedly referred to \"denial\", \\nespecially by sex offenders but also by violent aggressive \\npsychopaths, as a significant factor when assessing the \\n\"likelihood\" test in s. 753 concerning future re-offending. \\nUnwillingness to take treatment and prospects for successful \\ntreatment have always been important factors in these kinds of \\ncases, when assessing future dangerousness. See, e.g.: R. v. \\nAllen, supra at paras. 25-28; R. v. Little (2007), 2007 ONCA \\n548, 225 C.C.C. (3d) 20 at paras. 40-43 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. \\nMcCallum (2005), 201 C.C.C. (3d) 541 at para. 47 (Ont. C.A.); R. \\nv. B. (R.) (2011), 2011 ONCA 328, 280 O.A.C. 329 at paras. 13-14 \\n(Ont. C.A.); R. v. Ramgadoo, 2012 ONCA 921 at paras. 54-59. \\n. . . \\nIt can be seen that treatability of Gibson\\'s pedophilia, his attitude \\ntowards treatment, and his acknowledgement of the underlying \\ncondition that leads to his offending behaviour, are all important \\nfactors relating to the \"likelihood\" of future recidivism. \\n[207]  \\nMr. Hamelin’s conduct including his lack of insight and denial of need for \\ntreatment, at least prior to his comments to this court, are also considerations. \\n[208]  \\nI also consider his history of breach of court orders, including the LTSO’s.  The \\nhistory of the breaches of LTSO demonstrates the very brief time that was available for any \\nprogramming at the CCC, due at least in part to his criminal offending. \\n[209]  \\nAs I have stated already, he achieved little enduring success with the ICPM \\nCommunity Based program offered at Henry Trail. \\n[210]  \\nThe thrust of the Defence submission that this criteria has not been proven beyond \\na reasonable doubt arises in Dr. Gray’s evidence of the treatments, therapies and programming that \\nMr. Hamelin needs, the evidence of CSC as to the High Intensity ICPM available within the \\npenitentiary, the close restrictive supervision available at a CCC and the success this achieved at \\nHenry Trail, and the strictly limiting conditions that can be imposed on Mr. Hamelin by the Parole \\nBoard of Canada. \\n[211]  \\nThe defence relies on the evidence given by Dr. Gray in cross-examination which \\nI summarized at paras. 100 to 116 above, and which I quote at para. 283 below. \\n[212]  \\nDr. Gray noted that Mr. Hamelin has a disproportionate reaction to identifiable life \\nstressors which he has been unable to deal with and which can usually be managed or overcome. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 42 \\n \\n \\n[213]  \\nOn this issue, I have considered the evidence as directed by the Supreme Court of \\nCanada in Boutilier, as to the differing considerations of the same evidence of treatability at the \\ndesignation stage and the penalty stage (para. 31, 45, 46). \\n[214]  \\nAt the designation stage, I must consider the treatability evidence to assess the \\nfuture threat posed by Mr. Hamelin. \\n[215]  \\nAs Justice Molloy stated in Medford, albeit with respect to offences of sexual \\nviolence, \\n105  In Boutilier, the Supreme Court of Canada defined intractable conduct as \\n\"behavior that the offender is unable to surmount.\" This assessment is required to \\nbe forward looking, not merely a reiteration of a finding of intractable conduct in \\nthe past. However, in the situation before me I have a history of intractable \\nconduct, a mindset in the offender that there is nothing wrong with his sexual \\ndesires, and a refusal to participate in treatment in any meaningful way. In those \\ncircumstances, the pattern of intractable conduct is not suddenly going to change. \\nIt will continue into the future. There is no basis to conclude anything else. Mr. \\nMedford is not even prepared to try to surmount his deviant sexual urges in the \\nfuture; he does not even recognize or acknowledge that he has them. \\n[216]  \\nI find that on the evidence, it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. \\nHamelin’s problems are insurmountable. \\n[217]  \\nOn the evidence, I find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the \\nlikelihood of him inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons through failure in the \\nfuture to restrain his behaviour. \\n[218]  \\nMr. Hamelin’s treatment prospects combined with the CSC and PBC objectives, \\npowers and controls are not so compelling as to leave me with a reasonable doubt. \\n[219]  \\nAccording, I find it proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hamelin constitutes \\na threat to the life, safety, and physical and mental well being of other persons based on the \\nevidence in these proceedings. \\n[220]  \\nHaving already found it proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he has been \\nconvicted of a serious personal injury offence, I find Mr. Hamelin to be a dangerous offender. \\nPenalty Stage \\n[221]  \\nUpon finding that Mr. Hamelin meets the statutory definition of a dangerous \\noffender, I have 3 sentencing options: \\n(4) If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender, it shall \\n(a) impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate \\nperiod; \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 43 \\n \\n \\n(b) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been \\nconvicted — which must be a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a \\nterm of two years — and order that the offender be subject to long-term \\nsupervision for a period that does not exceed 10 years; or \\n(c) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been \\nconvicted. \\n[222]  \\nMy discretion in regard to sentence is limited by Section 4.1 which mandates,  \\n(4.1) The court shall impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an \\nindeterminate period unless it is satisfied by the evidence adduced during the \\nhearing of the application that there is a reasonable expectation that a lesser \\nmeasure under paragraph (4)(b) or (c) will adequately protect the public against \\nthe commission by the offender of murder or a serious personal injury offence. \\n[223]  \\nI repeat that in, Boutilier, the court directed: \\n31  … the purposes of prospective evidence at the designation and sentencing \\nstages are different. The designation stage is concerned with assessing the future \\nthreat posed by an offender. The penalty stage is concerned with imposing the \\nappropriate sentence to manage the established threat. Though evidence may \\nestablish that an offender is unable to surmount his or her violent conduct, the \\nsentencing judge must, at the penalty stage, turn his or her mind to whether the \\nrisk arising from the offender\\'s behaviour can be adequately managed outside of \\nan indeterminate sentence. \\n45  … At the designation stage, treatability informs the decision on the threat \\nposed by an offender, whereas at the penalty stage, it helps determine the \\nappropriate sentence to manage this threat. Thus, offenders will not be designated \\nas dangerous if their treatment prospects are so compelling that the sentencing \\njudge cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that they present a high \\nlikelihood of harmful recidivism or that their violent pattern is intractablel. \\nHowever, even where the treatment prospects are not compelling enough to affect \\nthe judge\\'s conclusion on dangerousness, they will still be relevant in choosing the \\nsentence required to adequately protect the public. \\n[224]  \\nIn R. v. Hemmings, 2021 ONCJ 407, the court quoted with approval from R. v. \\nBroadfoot, 2018 ONCJ 215 that the Boutilier decision should be interpreted such that at the \\ndesignation stage, intractability relates to whether or not the conduct can be treated whereas at the \\npenalty stage, having found that the conduct cannot be treated, the court must consider whether \\nthe conduct can be managed. \\n[225]  \\nJustice Molloy’s decision is again instructive. \\n112  Thus, an indeterminate sentence is not automatic upon a finding that the \\ndangerous offender requirements are met. I retain a discretion to impose a less \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 44 \\n \\n \\nrestrictive sentence. However, that discretion is limited by s. 753(4.1) of \\nthe Criminal Code, which requires me to impose an indeterminate \\nsentence unless I am satisfied that \"there is a reasonable expectation\" that one of \\nthe other two options \"will adequately protect the public against the commission \\nby the offender of murder or a serious personal injury offence.\" The question for \\nme to determine at this stage is whether there is a reasonable expectation that \\nimposing a regular sentence, or a determinate sentence followed by a Long-Term \\nSupervision Order (\"LTSO\") will adequately protect the public from the threat \\nMr. Medford represents. \\n113  Although the burden of proof was on the Crown to establish beyond a \\nreasonable doubt that the dangerous offender criteria had been met, the burden is \\ndifferent at this stage. I must consider whether I am satisfied that one of the other \\ntwo options will protect the public. If I am not satisfied, I am required to impose \\nan indeterminate sentence. Further, if I am uncertain whether the public would be \\nsatisfied, I must refuse to exercise my discretion to impose a lesser sentence. \\n. . . \\n115  In deciding this issue, I must keep in mind that the overriding aim of the \\ndangerous offender provisions \"is not the punishment of the offender but the \\nprevention of future violence.\"   In R. v. G.L., the Ontario Court of Appeal \\nrecognized that the decision at this stage is a balancing exercise in which the \\nsentencing judge must weigh the liberty interests of the offender against the risk \\nto public safety if he is released. The Court (per Cronk J.A.) held: \\n \\nAs I have indicated, the overriding purpose of the dangerous and \\nlong-term offender regimes is the protection of the public. Thus, \\n\\'real world\\' resourcing limitations cannot be ignored or minimized \\nwhere to do so would endanger public safety. The court is required \\non a dangerous offender application to balance the liberty interests \\nof an accused with the risk to public safety that will arise on the \\nrelease of the accused into the community. That balancing exercise \\nis informed by this fundamental principle: in a contest between an \\nindividual offender\\'s interest in invoking the long-term offender \\nprovisions of the Code and the protection of the public, the latter \\nmust prevail. This accords, in my opinion, with the intention of \\nParliament as expressed in the dangerous and long-term offender \\nprovisions of the Code, and in the Corrections and Conditional \\nRelease Act. \\n. . . \\n118  In G.L. the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized that an offender\\'s \\namenability to treatment is a relevant factor in determining whether his risk to the \\ncommunity can be eventually controlled, holding (at para. 40): \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 45 \\n \\n \\nIn Johnson, the Supreme Court also confirmed, at paras. 33-36, \\nthat prospective factors concerning an offender must be addressed \\non a dangerous offender application, including the possibility of \\neventual control of the offender\\'s risk in the community. \\nNecessarily, therefore, an offender\\'s amenability to treatment and \\nthe prospects for the success of treatment in reducing or containing \\nthe offender\\'s risk of reoffending are critical factors. \\nOther Legal Principles Applicable at the Penalty Stage \\nThe Section 718, and on, Principles Apply \\n[226]  \\nI must consider the principles of sentencing set out in section 718 of the Criminal \\nCode and thereafter, including the principles of proportionality, the gravity of the offence, the \\ndegree of responsibility of the offender, the deemed aggravating factors of abuse of an intimate \\npartner and the abuse of a position of trust, the significant impact on HN of Mr. Hamelin\\'s crimes \\nand the principles that the least restrictive sanctions should be imposed and that all available \\nsanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with \\nthe harm done to victims, should be considered for all offenders.  (Boutilier, para. 53 and R. v. \\nDrake, 2024 ONCA 4). \\nAggravating Factors \\n[227]  \\nThe index offences are the most recent of a pattern of repetitive behaviour that Mr. \\nHamelin has not restrained or is unable to restrain. \\n[228]  \\nThe level of harm caused and the nature of the harm caused to his victim rose to a \\nhigher level of gravity than exhibited in his prior offending. \\n[229]  \\nThe crimes were committed against a former domestic partner. \\n[230]  \\nMr. Hamelin\\'s criminal record includes convictions for similar criminal harassment \\noffences and for breach court orders. \\n[231]  \\nHe continued to commit offences against HN while in jail. \\n[232]  \\nThe impact of his crimes on his victim was serious, severe and the harm continues \\nto affect her daily life. \\n[233]  \\nThe underlying BPD and ABI combination is not treatable, nor can it be said that \\nthe normal declining trajectory for such conditions will occur.  At age 42, the nature of his \\noffending escalated.   \\n[234]  \\nHis past history, Dr. Gray’s opinion and common experience indicate that Mr. \\nHamelin will become involved in a domestic relationship in the future, that it will end and that he \\nwill reoffend. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 46 \\n \\n \\nMitigating Factors \\n[235]  \\nMr. Hamelin pleaded guilty. \\n[236]  \\nIt appears that for the first time to this Court, he apologized for what he did, \\nacknowledged it was wrong and that he needs help. \\n[237]  \\nHe did not offend while at Henry Trail under residency conditions of a LTSO and \\nclose supervision conditions.  \\n[238]  \\nThere are recommendations for future treatment and external controls. \\nReasonable Possibility \\n[239]  \\nIn R. v. Tremblay, Justice Karakatsanis, as she then was, stated that the court must \\nconsider whether there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the offender’s risk in the \\ncommunity.  She considered factors such as the offender being amenable to therapy, age and \\nburnout and supervision. \\n[240]  \\nThis court in R. v. Walford, [2007], O.N. No. 744, agreed with the “reasonable \\npossibility” of eventual control of the risk standard, stating: \\n“An expression of hope that future treatment will reduce the risk of re-offending \\ndoes not prove a reasonable possibility of eventual control of that risk.” (para. 77) \\nHarm Reduction not Risk Elimination \\n[241]  \\nJustice Karakatsanis also said in Tremblay: \\n191  However, the Criminal Code looks to a reasonable possibility of eventual \\ncontrol in the community. The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that the \\nrisk may not be eradicated but rather controlled to an acceptable level. There is a \\n\\'harm reduction\\' rather than a \\'risk elimination\\' focus to the long term offender \\nprovisions. As the Court of Appeal stated in G.L. \"s. 753.1(1)(c) requires that \\nthere be a \"reasonable possibility,\" rather than a certainty, of the eventual control \\nof the risk posed by an offender\": R. v. G.L., above, at para. 39. \\n192  The determination of whether an offender\\'s risk can be reduced to an \\n\"acceptable\" level requires consideration of all factors, including treatment, which \\ncan bring about sufficient risk reduction to ensure protection of the public. This \\ndoes not require showing that an offender will be \"cured\" through treatment or \\nthat his or her rehabilitation may be assured. What it does require, however, is \\nproof that the nature and severity of an offender\\'s identified risk can be \\nsufficiently contained in the community, a non-custodial setting, so as to protect \\nthe public: R. v. G. L., above, at para. 42. \\nTo the same effect is R. v. D.B., 2015 ONSC 5900, (para. 200). \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 47 \\n \\n \\nMr. Hamelin’s Personal Circumstances \\n[242]  \\nI must not lose sight of Mr. Hamelin\\'s personal circumstances, and his potential for \\nrehabilitation. \\n[243]  \\nI must not overemphasize denunciation and deterrence.  (R. v. Paredes, 2014 \\nONCA 910, para. 48). \\nMr. Hamelin’s Words to the Court \\n[244]  \\nMr. Hamelin said he was sorry. He said he was wrong. He said he needed help. \\n[245]  \\nDr. Gray reported that when he interviewed him, Mr. Hamelin said he was not \\naware of any specific issues for which he needs treatment, and “agreed only he needs help with \\n“emotional stuff” and “mental health”, when prompted.” \\n[246]  \\nDr. Gray concluded that even with the risk management interventions that he \\nidentified, \\n“the likelihood of control of Mr. Hamelin\\'s risk of harassing future ex-partners is \\nrelatively low.” \\nDoes Mr. Hamelin’s Conduct Meet the Requisite Level of Dangerousness \\n[247]  \\nAs stated in Boutilier,  \\n111  Section 753(4.1) imposes indeterminate detention unless the sentencing \\njudge is satisfied that there is a reasonable expectation that a lesser measure is \\nadequate for public protection. In assessing whether a lesser measure \"will \\nadequately protect the public against the commission by the offender of murder or \\na serious personal injury offence\", sentencing judges must consider both \\nthe level of the risk presented by the offender and the nature of the harm the \\noffender is likely to cause. The specific reference to murder in s. 753(4.1) \\nsuggests that indeterminate detention should only be imposed in cases where the \\noffender\\'s risk is expected to manifest itself in the most severe forms of serious \\npersonal injury offences. For example, if there is a high risk that the offender will \\ncommit another serious personal injury offence, but this offence is not likely to \\ninvolve significant violence (e.g. criminal harassment, obstruction of justice), s. \\n753(4.1) does not necessarily mandate indeterminate detention. Indeed, the \\nprinciple of restraint bars sentencing judges from imposing indeterminate \\ndetention on offenders who are not likely to commit very serious crimes in the \\nfuture (see Johnson, at para. 40). As [page991] discussed above, serious personal \\ninjury offences include offences that do not involve serious violence. The \\nquestion a sentencing judge must ask in applying s. 753(4.1) is this: Does this \\noffender, due to the level of the risk and the nature of future harm likely to be \\ncaused, fall within the small group of truly dangerous offenders who must be \\nimprisoned indefinitely in order to protect the public? \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 48 \\n \\n \\n. . . \\n114  Given the severity of indeterminate detention, this sentence will only be \\nproportionate when the offender is very blameworthy and the offence is quite \\ngrave. Apart perhaps from life imprisonment, an indeterminate sentence is the \\nharshest sanction available under the Criminal Code. Testimony in a recent case \\nindicated that only 4-5 percent of dangerous offenders are ever released on parole \\n(R. v. Walsh, 2017 BCCA 195, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at para. 22). In addition, they \\nare viewed as low priority for placement in treatment programs in prison, \\ncontributing to their poor prospects for rehabilitation and release (ibid.; R. v. \\nPayne (2001), 41 C.R. (5th) 156 (Ont. Sup. Ct.)). In effect, an indeterminate \\nsentence amounts \"to a life sentence with little chance of parole\" (Walsh, at para. \\n22). This Court has characterized the effects of indeterminate detention as \\n\"profoundly devastating\" (Lyons, at p. 339). \\n. . . \\n117  The offender\\'s degree of responsibility is not reflected in the s. 753(4.1) \\npublic safety threshold (see R. v. Radcliffe, 2017 ONCA 176, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 3, \\nat para. 57; R. v. B. (D.V.), 2010 ONCA 291, 100 O.R. (3d) 736, at para. 80, leave \\nto appeal refused, [2011] 3 S.C.R. vii). And given the broad definition of serious \\npersonal injury offences (which, despite their name, need not necessarily entail \\nserious injury), indeterminate detention will be disproportionate to the gravity of \\nthe offence for many offenders who meet the designation criteria. But a \\nsentencing judge is required to impose indeterminate detention on offenders \\nwhose moral blameworthiness is limited if the public safety threshold in s. \\n753(4.1) is not met, even if this sentence is inconsistent with Gladue principles. \\n. . . \\n119  Section 753(4.1) may also preclude a sentence that respects the principle of \\nrestraint. This provision resolves any uncertainty about the offender\\'s amenability \\nto treatment in favour of indeterminate detention (R. v. R.S., 2016 ONSC 7767, at \\nparas. 51 and 102 (CanLII)). Section 753(4.1) creates a presumption for an \\nindeterminate sentence that is only rebuttable by \"evidence adduced during the \\nhearing\". The Crown will often know about the existence of community-based \\nsupervision programs, but it is not required to lead evidence on this point, and if \\nno relevant evidence is provided to the court, the appropriate sentence is an \\nindeterminate one (Radcliffe, at para. 58; R. v. Smarch, 2015 YKCA 13, 374 \\nB.C.A.C. 280, at para. 48). As one of the interveners, the Yukon Legal Services \\nSociety, points out, the absence of evidence that suitable community supervision \\nprograms exist is sometimes attributable to an offender\\'s limited resources or the \\nlack of programming in a particular community, rather than to the inability to \\nmanage the offender\\'s risk. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 49 \\n \\n \\n[248]  \\nThe court in R. v. Wesley, 2018 ONCA 636 makes it clear that psychiatric evidence \\nmust be considered at both the designation stage and the penalty stage. The court approved of the \\ntrial judge’s consideration of the offender’s lengthy history of non compliance with community \\nbased dispositions and court orders which did not curb his offending. That appellant offended \\nwhile on probation, recognizances and peace bonds. The trial judge had reviewed that offender’s \\nhistory in various institutions, counseling, his inability to sustain change, his pattern of justifying, \\nminimizing or blaming others, his failing to identify consequences and the impact of his conduct \\non others. Mr. Hamelin and his offending conduct bear the same characteristics. \\n[249]  \\nDespite the evidence of significant and multiple efforts at treating and delivering \\nprogramming to Mr. Hamelin and the lack of success in doing so, including Mr. Hamelin’s lack \\nof insight, refusal to accept responsibility, denial and disengaging from or refusing to significantly \\nparticipate in what has been offered, I have considered the evidence of Dr. Gray that there are \\nsome treatments, therapies and programming that should have been offered and may have been \\nbeneficial but that for the reasons identified have not been provided. \\n[250]  \\nDr. Gray’s opinion is set out in his report, \\n“If sentenced to a term of federal incarceration, it would be helpful for him to \\nparticipate in recommended groups or individual treatment offered by the \\nCorrectional Services of Canada (CSC).  (emphasis by Dr. Gray) \\n. . . \\nThere are several challenges with this possible avenue of treatment. \\nMr. Hamelin has not generally done well in group treatments, and I \\nunderstand that while some individual supplementation is available, the \\nmainstay of the ICPM program is group therapy. …  \\n. . . \\nAnother potential challenge is the more unusual needs he presents for \\ntreatment. Unlike most of the likely candidates for the ICPM or other \\ncorrectional programs, he has no problems with substance abuse or physical \\nviolence. In my opinion, the main issues that need treatment are managing \\npowerful emotions, healthy relationships, and making good decisions, but this \\nmay not necessarily be the main part of programming. On the positive side, I \\nunderstand most correctional program would feature some degree of anger \\nmanagement, a related issue for which Mr. Hamelin needs help. \\nUnfortunately, in interview with me and in past interviews, he has consistently \\ndenied having a problem with anger. This may foreshadow a lack of \\nengagement in this treatment modality. \\nWhen and if he is released in the community, I would recommend the \\nfollowing interventions, and will comment on the challenges each may pose \\nfor Mr. Hamelin\\'s case. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 50 \\n \\n \\nInitially, Mr. Hamelin should be released to a supervised residence such as \\na CCC. This would serve several purposes. Housing will be a major \\nchallenge for Mr. Hamelin … \\n. . . \\nSecond, residence in a CCC with a dedicated probation officer would assist in \\nhelping him connect to services and a structured schedule, as suggested \\nbelow.  \\n. . . \\nThird, with close supervision, probation officers are more likely to become \\naware when he develops new relationships, and would in theory be able to \\nmonitor them.  \\n. . . \\nI will address the major difficulties in this aspect of risk mitigation below. \\nThe challenge to a condition of residency in a CCC, based on his past history, \\nis that he has persistently complained about having to reside there in the past \\nwhile under a LTSO. He felt it was impeding his ability to be involved in \\ncommunity activities and find a job. While he stated to me in interview he \\nwould have no difficulty in residing in a CCC, so long as it wasn\\'t KCCC, I \\nnote that his opinions about options in the future change over time and \\nultimately one cannot predict how he will react to placement in a CCC upon \\nrelease from incarceration.” \\n[251]  \\nI observe that the Crown seeks a condition barring Mr. Hamelin from Kingston.  \\nBut the only other CCC is Keele which has been completely unsuccessful for Mr. Hamelin. \\n[252]  \\nDr. Gray’s opinion in his report continues. \\n“Mr. Hamelin appeared to benefit from his engagement with the Brain Injury \\nServices team and an individual worker, Ms. Revell. I agree with Ms. Astri \\nthat he should be linked up with a similar organization in the future to help \\nhim find structured activities, housing, and to attend necessary counselling and \\nmedical appointments.  \\n. . . \\nAlong with support from a brain injury service, it would be important for Mr. \\nHamelin to keep busy with structured, meaningful activities. This should \\ninclude some supportive employment and volunteer activities. To Mr. \\nHamelin\\'s credit, he appears to be a hard worker when he finds an activity \\ninteresting and feels useful. …  \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 51 \\n \\n \\n. . . \\nMr. Hamelin should engage in counselling and therapy in the community. \\nIn my opinion, the most helpful modality of therapy would be groups and \\nindividual counselling centering around managing powerful emotions, \\ndecision making, relationships, and anger management. For those suffering \\nfrom BPD, the mainstay of therapy is Dialectical Behavioural Therapy. \\nThis involves elements such as distress tolerance, coping skills, mindfulness, \\nand developing health relationships. This modality of treatment is relatively \\ncommon in the community, and often available in community mental health \\ncentres. For reasons that are unclear, he started treatment in this area at \\nSLVCI, but after one session, it was not continued. He would need not only a \\nfull course of therapy, but availability of counsellors trained in these \\ntechniques to be available to him in the community on an ongoing basis. \\nAdditionally, due to his cognitive and hearing challenges, accommodations \\nand an adaptive approach is necessary for this to be successful. \\nIt is likely Mr. Hamelin will at least try to participate in the therapy. One \\nwould hope that he would eventually develop insight into his problematic \\nbehaviours, or at least develop practical techniques to deal with his intense \\nfeelings of distress and rage when he feels abandoned by those close to him. \\nWithout any history of successful treatment, I cannot say with any certainty it \\nwill work in the future for Mr. Hamelin. \\nIn terms of medications, Mr. Hamelin stated he is happy with his current \\nregimen. It includes the psychostimulant Vyvanse, the anti-depressant and \\nanti-anxiety medication, Venlafaxine (Effexor), and the mood-stabilizer/anti-\\ndepressant Aripiprazole (Abilify). \\n. . . \\nNevertheless, anti-anxiety and mood stabilizing medications could be helpful \\nin allowing Mr. Hamelin to access healthy coping mechanisms when under \\nstress. I would suggest, instead of Aripiprazole, a trial of an anti-convulsant \\nmedication such as Epival to help with mood regulation. …  \\n.  .  .  \\nGiven Mr. Hamelin\\'s apparent compliance with mediations when he is happy \\nwith their effects, the prospect of his complying with medications in the future, \\nso long as the side effects are not adverse, is reasonably good. \\nThe above recommendation is related to the next suggestion, involvement with a \\npsychiatrist to manage his medications and help direct him to appropriate \\npsychological therapy. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 52 \\n \\n \\nThe last area needing management is his history of dysfunctional relationships, \\nparticularly upon their dissolution. \\nUnfortunately, this important area will be highly challenging to address. \\n. . . \\nUnfortunately, Mr. Hamelin\\'s relationship with the victim soured after LTSO \\nand any other conditions of supervision expired. \\nThe ultimate question is whether, had such conditions been in effect during \\nthe dissolution of his relationship with HN, it would have prevented his \\nreoffence. This would help determine whether a high degree of supervision \\nand monitoring of his relationships in the future would help prevent severe \\npsychological harm to his partners by him upon the dissolution of the \\nrelationship. \\nI note some areas of concern in this regard. Ms. Astri noted that there \\nappeared to be major problems in his relationship with HN in the months \\nbefore the date he cited as when problems started. He lacks insight into his \\nbehaviours, and often has a poor memory of events. I note also Mr. Hamelin \\nconsistently portrayed his relationship with AB as going well when he was \\nwith her, even when she related a different perspective to probation officers \\nand in statements after the relationship ended. In addition, Mr. Hamelin has a \\nlong history of not telling the truth. This would affect his potential \\ntransparency in reporting adverse events to a probation officer in future \\nrelationships. \\nWhile check-ins with a potential future partner is necessary for a supervising \\nprobation officer, it is unclear if this will be sufficient. … This would suggest \\nthat increased oversight by a probation officer may still not be able to detect \\nproblems in the relationship before another offence is committed. \\n. . . \\nInterventions to manage a potential break-up may paradoxically worsen the \\nproblem. \\nFurther, the threat of legal sanction, and non-contact orders, have had no effect \\nin dissuading Mr. Hamelin from contacting his ex-partners. He has gone so \\nfar as contacting ex-partners from jail against his conditions, suggesting that \\neven incarceration may not prevent future offending. \\nIf released from incarceration, regardless of the challenges, it would still be \\nnecessary for tight supervision of any future relationships with females and to \\nincrease interventions should the relationship dissolve. In support of this, it \\nwould be important from a risk perspective for Mr. Hamelin to meet \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 53 \\n \\n \\nregularly with a probation officer while in the community. I would \\nsuggest at least weekly meetings initially. \\nIt would also be helpful that \\ncounselling be increased when there are signs of problems in any future \\nrelationships, rather than impose punitive measures or restrictions. \\nOverall, however, as described above, in my opinion the likelihood of control \\nof Mr. Hamelin\\'s risk of harassing future ex-partners is relatively low, even \\nwith the above suggested risk-management interventions. \\nI would suggest that the interventions embedded in my comments above, and \\nhighlighted in bold, be adopted by the National Parole Board should he be \\nrecommended for release from incarceration.” \\n[253]  \\nThe evidence of CSC is that there is programming designed to deal with offenders \\nwho deny responsibility and refuse treatment. The evidence of CSC is that a residency condition \\nwhile available only for the first year initially can be extended on a yearly basis. The parole officers \\nare empowered to impose local conditions to address Mr. Hamelin\\'s offence cycle. \\n[254]  \\nCSC\\'s normal contact with a parole officer for Mr. Hamelin can be twice per week, \\nand this can be increased, \\n[255]  \\nCSC has the ability to closely monitor relationships as demonstrated by Mr. Herbert \\nand stated by Ms. Howie. \\n[256]  \\nThe evidence of the Parole Board of Canada is that special conditions on a LTSO \\ncan be imposed including tight restrictions on friendships or relationships with females, and access \\nto and use of electronic devices and on locations in the community where Mr. Hamelin can and \\ncannot be permitted to attend. \\n[257]  \\nIt was suggested by defence that a condition such as no contact with any female \\nperson could be imposed. \\nLongest Previous Sentence \\n[258]   \\nIt is to be noted that the previous longest sentence of imprisonment for Mr. Hamelin \\nto date appears to have been less than two years of incarceration. In 2011 and 2012, he was \\nsentenced to 2 consecutive 8 month sentences. \\nPre Sentence Custody \\n[259]  \\nMr. Hamelin has been in custody since December 25, 2019. That is the equivalent \\nof 1500 days actual custody to February 5, 2024. He has served that time in the provincial detention \\ncentre system, Quinte and Central East \\n[260]  \\nThe Crown, with the consent of defence, is prepared to give Mr. Hamelin enhanced \\ncredit for 1 year 9 months of the time served under the harshest of COVID conditions at 2 days \\nper 1 day actual pre sentence custody, totalling 1280 days, to February 5, 2024. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 54 \\n \\n \\n[261]  \\nIn addition, the Crown with the consent of defence, is prepared to credit Mr. \\nHamelin for the balance of his actual presentence custody at 1.5 days/1 day actual, totalling 1290 \\ndays, to February 5, 2024. \\n[262]  \\nThus, counsel agree that Mr. Hamelin should have the benefit of 2570 days of \\nenhanced presentence custody credit which is the equivalent of 7 years 15 days, up to February 5, \\n2024. \\nThe Gravity of the Offence \\n[263]  \\nMr. Hamelin’s offending is very serious. \\n[264]  \\nHe inflicted profound severe psychological damage to HN which will continue to \\nhaunt her. His offending is at the high end of gravity for the offences of criminal harassment. \\nThe Degree of Responsibility of Mr. Hamelin \\n[265]  \\nMr. Hamelin\\'s criminal conduct is due at least in part to his personal makeup, which \\nincludes the combination of hearing deficit, brain injury, borderline personality disorder, which, \\napart from the brain injury, and although diagnosed and identified, have been largely untreated for \\nthe various reasons set out in the evidence. \\n[266]  \\nHe persisted in his criminal conduct despite knowing HN wanted no contact with \\nhim and despite the intervention of the police, the court and jail. \\n[267]  \\nHe says he wanted to hurt her.  He did, causing severe psychological injury on the \\nmany levels she described in her victim impact statement. \\n[268]  \\nHe pleaded guilty. \\n[269]  \\nHe has not resiled from the acceptance of responsibility. \\nThe History of Breaches \\n[270]  \\nThe history of breaches shows that Mr. Hamelin served only approximately 9 \\nmonths out of the 4 year LTSO in a Community Correctional Centre. He was at Keele from \\nFebruary 25 or 26, 2015 until April 22, 2015 and from March 29, 2016 to April 4, 2016. He was \\nat Henry Trail from July 18, 2018 until February 18, 2019 when his LTSO expired. This is because \\nof the provincial remand custody time that he served awaiting disposition of the 3 breach charges. \\n[271]  \\nWhile at Henry Trail, between October 1, 2018 and November 26, 2018, he was \\nexposed to the ICPM, community program. But he did not like the programming and denied his \\nguilt. \\n[272]  \\nUpon the expiration of his LTSO in February 2019, the responsible correctional \\nprogram officer noted that he declined to meet with her and review his self-management plans. \\nShe wrote, “stating that he could not see any benefits to such meeting and that he is “not even \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 55 \\n \\n \\nremotely interested” in meeting for this purpose. He offered he has “everything figured out” and \\nhe is prepared for all aspects of reintegration. He offered that he does not need any help or \\nsuggestions on how to manage effectively his risk factors as he opined he does not “have any risk \\nfactors in the community” and he has “everything lined up” for success including a place to stay \\nand a job”.  \\n[273]  \\nOf course, he committed the very serious personal injury offences of an escalated \\nnature upon HN thereafter. \\n[274]  \\nOther courts have commented on Mr. Hamelin’s need for treatment. \\n[275]  \\nThis evidence must be considered in light of the opinion of Dr. Gray concerning \\nthe treatment and programming that Mr. Hamelin should have been offered but was not.  That \\nevidence also ties in with the evidence of the CSC programming that is available within the \\ninstitution, and the statutory purpose of conditional release namely to contribute to the \\nmaintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by means of decisions on the timing and conditions \\nof release that will best facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the \\ncommunity as law-abiding citizens. The protection of society is the paramount consideration for \\nthe Parole Board in all cases. \\n[276]  \\nClearly, the loss of the intended benefits of the LTSO must be attributed, in large \\npart, to the criminal conduct of Mr. Hamelin, as described in the sentencing decisions for the \\nbreaches, resulting in provincial remand detention for over 3 years of his LTSO. It can also be \\nattributed in part to his attitude against recommended programming and denials of responsibility \\nfor his criminal conduct. \\n[277]  \\nAs previously observed, he has not been exposed to the High-Intensity ICPM \\noffered within the federal penitentiary system, with the programming that has been described in \\nthe evidence. \\n[278]  \\nThe question on sentence of whether to impose an indeterminate sentence or a fixed \\nterm sentence followed by a longer term of LTSO, comes down to balancing the statutory \\nprinciples set out in the CCRA, Dr. Gray’s opinion as to what has been and what has not been and \\nwhat should be offered by way of treatment, programming and counselling, the programming that \\nis offered by CSC within the federal institution, the conditions that can be imposed by the Parole \\nBoard of Canada upon Mr. Hamelin if on a LTSO and Mr. Hamelin’s willingness and ability to \\nengage in what is recommended for and provided to him with purposes of the dangerous offender \\nlegislation. \\n[279]  \\nAs I have stated, I must consider the provisions of s. 753(4.1) and s. 718 and of the \\nCriminal Code. \\n[280]  \\nIn balancing the interests of Mr. Hamelin and the protection of the public, the latter \\nmust prevail.  \\n[281]  \\nI have considered both the level of the risk presented by Mr. Hamelin and the nature \\nof the harm that he presents. \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 56 \\n \\n \\n[282]  \\nIn deciding the penalty for Mr. Hamelin, the list of considerations identified by \\nJustice Hill in R. v. DB, 2015 ONSC 5900 is helpful: \\n194  At a minimum, the phrasing \"reasonable expectation\" requires an evidence-\\nbased evaluation, based upon objectively valid and relevant criteria, with \\nprobabilistic assessment exceeding chance, speculation, hope or mere possibility \\nthat something will happen. While the question arises as to any further \\nprobabilistic degree of satisfaction required of the court, given the priority for \\npublic safety animating Part XXIV determinations, I am prepared to look to \\nsatisfaction on a balance of probabilities in deciding the s. 753(4.1) \"expectation\" \\nissue. \\n198  In the balancing exercise to determine whether public protection can \\nrealistically be achieved by a disposition less severe than indeterminate, \\nimprisonment, bearing in mind that \"Parliament has provided that [such detention] \\nshould not be imposed unless there is no reasonable expectation that a lesser \\nmeasure will be able to adequately protect the public\" (Sawyer, at para. 30), the \\ntotality of the circumstances of a particular case must be scrutinized. There is no \\nexhaustive menu of relevant factors for consideration as to whether an offender\\'s \\nfuture conduct is likely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural \\nrestraint. Important are the nature and circumstances of the predicate crimes, \\ncriminal history of the offender, the nature and duration and intensity of his or her \\nmental disorder, treatability, profile of previous compliance with orders and \\nrelease conditions, expert risk assessments respecting likelihood of reoffending, \\nattitude and motivation of the offender, community capacity to adequately \\nmonitor and supervise the offender upon release, etc. \\n199  Reference to the relevant jurisprudence reveals exploration of a number of \\nthese subjects including the following: \\n(1)the degree to which the offender has been cooperative with the Part XXIV \\nprocess \\n\\uf0fc Mr. Hamelin has been cooperative with the DO process. \\n \\n(2)whether the offender has previously refused treatment or failed to take \\nadvantage of treatment opportunities \\n\\uf0fd Mr. Hamelin has previously refused treatment and failed to \\ntake advantage of treatment opportunities. \\n \\n(3)whether the offender has been expelled from prior treatment programs \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 57 \\n \\n \\n\\uf0fd Mr. Hamelin has been expelled from prior treatment \\nprograms. \\n \\n(4)whether the offender has previously refused to take prescribed medication or \\nhas unilaterally discontinued pharmacological treatment \\n\\uf0fc Mr. Hamelin has been compliant with prescribed \\nmedication. \\n \\n(5)whether the offender has taken treatment in the past and if so whether it \\nultimately failed to reduce or control the offender\\'s risk to the public \\n\\uf0fd Past treatment which has been taken by him has failed to \\nreduce or control his risk to reoffend. \\n \\n(6)is the offender motivated and committed to treatment? \\n\\uf0fd While Mr. Hamelin told the Court and Dr. Gray that he \\nwill take treatment, the past demonstrates otherwise, as do \\nhis words upon expiration of the LTSO. \\n \\n(7)are there realistic prospects for treating the offender\\'s mental disorder(s) having \\nregard to relevant factors such as propensity and intractability? \\n\\uf0fd Dr. Gray’s opinion is that there is no realistic prospect of \\ntreatment of Mr. Hamelin’s BPD in combination of his ABI. \\n\\uf0fd Dr. Chan concluded that Mr. Hamelin’s difficulties arising from \\nhis brain injury will not get any better. \\n\\uf0fd As defence counsel noted what the risk of harm that Mr. Hamelin \\nwould present after a determinate sentence followed by a lengthy \\nLTSO is unknown, “we don’t know how the future is going to play \\nout.”  Dr. Gray agreed. \\n \\n(8)respecting the predicate offences, is there a lack of insight, failure to accept \\nresponsibility, denial and minimization, a lack of empathy for the victim(s), \\nabsence of remorse? \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 58 \\n \\n \\n\\uf0fd Up until his words to this court, Mr. Hamelin has demonstrated a \\nlack of insight and a lack of empathy for HN.  However, he \\npleaded guilty.  He said he was sorry.  He said he needs help. \\n \\n(9)the circumstances of the offender\\'s institutional behaviour including in advance \\nof the dangerous offender hearing \\n\\uf0fc Mr. Hamelin’s institutional behaviour has been \\nsatisfactory, although he has offended from within a jail \\nand breached his LTSO, and declined treatment including \\ndisrupting programs. \\n \\n(10)what improvements or gains in risk reduction can be expected during a period \\nof custody preceding community release? \\n\\uf0fd This is a key factor in that the only opinion concerning \\nimprovements or gains on risk reduction during a period in \\ncustody before a community release is that the High Intensity \\nICPM would benefit him and is available.  There is no evidence of \\nwhat degree of risk management could be achieved with this \\ncombined with the CBT and DPT and other therapies \\nrecommended. \\n\\uf0fd There is no evidence that such treatment would give rise to a \\nreasonable expectation of adequately protecting the public. \\n \\n(11)has past engagement with community supervision been compliant? \\n\\uf0fd Brief success at Henry Trail under the close supervision of Mr. \\nHebert was achieved for about 9 months.  The balance of the 4 \\nyear residential LTSO was spent in provincial remand jails without \\ntreatment or programming.  The exit meeting on February 2019 \\ndoes not give rise to an expectation of future compliance, nor does \\nhis history of fail to comply convictions. \\n \\n(12)apart from treatment considerations, are there sufficiently available and \\nresourced external controls in the community to adequately protect the public? \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 59 \\n \\n \\n\\uf0fd The evidence of CSC and PBC is that sufficiently available and \\nresourced external controls are available.  But there is the \\nexample of Toronto South Detention Centre putting him on the \\nstreet to find his way to St. Leonard’s House in Brampton.  There \\nis the example of breach at KCCC of not reporting relationships \\nfor 2 months following admission.  And there are the 2 examples of \\nUAL from KCCC.  Once the LTSO expires, if imposed, there are \\nno external controls.  The offences against HN occurred in that \\ncircumstance. \\n \\n(13)as a factor independent of treatment, is there compelling, not speculative, \\nexpert evidence that the offender\\'s proclivities will significantly decline in the \\nfuture while falling within the period of a determinate sentence and the term of a \\nLTSO? \\n\\uf0fd There is no evidence, expert or otherwise, that Mr. Hamelin’s \\nproclivities will significantly decline in the future within a \\ndeterminate sentence followed by a LTSO.  The best that can be \\nsaid is that while he is subject to a residency condition at Henry \\nTrail for the entire period of a LTSO, supervised by Mr. Hebert, on \\na strict condition to report friendships or relationships, strictly \\ndefined, he will not reoffend. \\n\\uf0fd However, the Crown seeks an Order that he be barred from \\nKingston.  That would place him at KCCC where he has totally \\nfailed. \\n\\uf0fd Furthermore, he reoffended on an escalated basis shortly after the \\nHenry Trail LTSO expired.  No harm reduction of any significant \\nduration has been achieved over all the years of convictions and \\nsentences. \\n\\uf0fd A further consideration in this regard is that his offending does not \\nrequire any physical strength or effort.  He offends by his words \\nand delivering his words to those he targets, ex partners, her \\nemployer, her volunteer groups, her neighbours.  It is not an age \\nor physical health limited offence cycle. \\n[283]  \\nThe most supporting evidence for the defence position is found in the final cross \\nexamination testimony of Dr. Gray: \\n“1.  Q.  Is Mr. Hamelin “likely” to cause severe psych - psychological trauma  \\n \\nin the future? \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 60 \\n \\n \\nA.  What I think is yes … like I said without … like, going through like \\nmy whole report, … there’s an escalating pattern, very similar types of \\noffences. \\n. . . \\nQ.  … I’m just wondering what does “likely” mean in that sentence? \\nA.  I don’t think if I can put a percentage, but if – if you want – if you \\nwant me to tie down a percentage, I guess more than 50 percent because \\nit’s likely, and less than 50 is an not likely. \\nQ.  Unlikely.  As in probable is 50 percent plus 1, and improbable is 50 \\npercent minus 1. \\nA.  Yes. \\n. . . \\nQ.  …well, here\\'s another question about levels of risk. I asked you about \\nlikelihood. You\\'re saying his risk is high. What is - what does that mean? \\nCan you unpack that a little bit? If not in percentages, then does that mean \\nlikelihood, 50 percent plus 1, or – or something different? \\nA.  …knowing that I can’t really put a percentage figure on Mr. Hamelin’s \\nactual risk, what I was doing was in each stage, just like if we can break it \\ndown into parts, is each stage reasonably foreseeable and likely to happen?  \\nLike, is he going to get into another relationship?  He’s only 42.  He’ll \\nprobably get in another, like, it seems like almost – I don’t wanna say a \\ncertainty, but it’s quite likely, given his personal characteristics that he’ll \\nget into another relationship, another romantic relationship.  And will that \\nrelationship end?  Probably it will, given the past history.  Will he have \\nproblems with that?  Probably.  And then the question, I guess, that maybe \\nyou’re most focused on is, when he breaks up, will there be his actions to \\nthe extent he\\'ll cause psychological damage to the person?  So, I’m going \\non past history, the – the index victim, and the last victim, [AB], describe \\npsychological harm, severe psychological harm from the victim impact – \\nimpact statements.  So, is the next one gonna have that?  I – like, it’s – it’s \\nbased on so many other factors.  Like, is he gonna change with therapy?  \\nIs he – are our measures gonna stop him completely from communicating \\nonce things fall off the rails?  Is the person able to escape somehow, or I \\ndon’t know, and avoid any kind of contact on their own by whatever \\nmeasure she can?  So, there are other factors.  But I’m just going on the – \\nthe past history, what’s going on in terms of severity over time. \\n2.  Q. But to be clear, the – the kind of relationship that the Correctional  \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 61 \\n \\n \\nService of Canada would be concerned about would be any relationship. \\nBut the kind of harm that you have spoken about and are trying to assess \\nthe risk of, is – is a longer term relationship, right?  \\nA. Yeah.  \\nQ. Okay. And isn’t it fair to say that given the good supervision and – and \\nclose management of someone like Mr. Hamelin, by someone like Parole \\nOfficer Hebert (ph), the kinds of problems and escalation such as sending \\na threatening e-mail or making a threatening phone call, or doing any of \\nthe kinds of things that he’s been convicted of doing, would be detected at \\nthe first instance because a victim, presumably, would alert the parole \\nofficer at the first time something criminal or very concerning would \\nhappen.  \\nA. Yes. I – you’ve got a point there. Assuming that the – the – the partner \\ndidn’t have fear that there’d be retribution or – or revenge by Mr. Hamelin \\nif she called the parole officer and reported what he’s doing.  \\nQ. Right. So, differentiating the kind of offences Mr. – Mr. Hamelin has \\nbeen convicted of, and the kind of severe psychological harm that – that \\nall of us are trying to prevent, and avoid, unlike a sexual offence that can \\nhappen in seconds, unlike someone pulling a gun or a bat and inflicting \\nmassive, physical harm on someone. The kind of harm that Mr. Hamelin \\ncauses to his victims is the kind that, one, is easily detectable, and two, is \\nsome – it occurs over a – a continuum of time where the first missteps can \\nand – and – and most likely will be detected and – and remediated.  \\nA. Yeah. That’s – I think that’s a fair point. \\n. . . \\nA. Yeah. So, I’d say that, like, if you, in fairness to you, or I guess to your \\nclient, the times where with AB (ph) where there’s continual breaches of his \\nprobation, contact, back and forth, that was under conditions of provincial \\nprobation. And my understanding of a long-term supervision order, it’s a bit \\ntighter and the consequences of a breach are more severe. So, potentially, a \\nparole officer under a LTSO could reincarcerate him if there’s – I guess what \\nthey have a – and the power to do that based on, say the, like, the new \\ngirlfriend saying, ‘You know, he’s been yelling at me much more lately. I’m \\nafraid he’s gonna go off or something.’ If that’s enough, so, I – I don’t know \\nlegally, like, how - how quickly a probation officer could bring someone in, \\nnot because they’re not reporting a relationship, but because of tensions in the \\nrelationship.  \\nQ. … I guess I’m suggesting to you that the kind of criminal cycle that Mr. \\nHamelin has – has shown, is the kind of behaviour that is easily detected long \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 62 \\n \\n \\nbefore severe psychological harm would – would ensue. After repeated and – \\nand – and – more intrusive each time, and more harmful each time, these acts \\nbecame as it escalate.  \\nA. Yeah. I – I agree with that.  \\n       3.  Q.  Given that he has not been very much treated to any measurable extent,  \\nand you have identified the kind of treatment he – you think he needs, that \\nhasn’t been tried. And the kind of medication, perhaps. I mean there’s an \\never-evolving list of off-label medications that could be tried. And therapy \\nthat might be geared to him. In that sense, isn’t he treatable? I mean, isn’t it \\nworth a try to try all of those things? Not just one little thing, but therapy, \\nprogramming, new medications. You know, he’s treatable. You can’t say he’s \\nnot treatable.  \\nA. You could try those new things, but it’s – I’m not sure I’m defining \\ntreatable as being someone who hasn’t exhausted every conceivable method \\nof treating them. I – the concern I have is – is the pattern of his engagement \\nwith treatment. How it’s not been successful. Even though he hasn’t had \\nmaybe the – the types of treatment that would be best. He hasn’t had a full try \\nat that. It just – there’s been no evidence to kind of hook onto to say, ‘Well – \\nhe’ll do well, just like he did on this particular treatment in the past, this is an \\neven better type of treatment, and he has done well in the past, so maybe he’ll \\ndo well with this.’ There’s a – like, there’s no precedent to help, you know, \\ngive hope about the future treatment actually working.  \\n. . . \\nQ. … So, I’m just saying it’s possible and he does have some indications that \\nif he’s motivated by the – the right environment and the right people, he can \\nrespond to treatment.  \\nA. Yeah.  \\nQ. And – and there are lots of kinds of treatment that we’ve gone over that \\nhasn’t been tried. Art therapy is one example, specifically geared to his love \\nfor art that – that – that might work.  \\nA. Could be of assistance.  \\nQ. I mean it’s not the same as a sex offender who has gone through the \\nmoderate and intensity program and in a high intensity program, and then \\nreoffended and then reoffended. Which – which as you know, happens a lot. \\nAnd in those kinds of cases, it’s – it’s much more clear to say, you know, he \\nhas been engaged with specific treatments, designed to assess his specific \\nneeds, and – and he’s failed. Once or twice, or...  \\nA. Yeah.  \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 63 \\n \\n \\nQ. ...sometimes three times. And reoffend.  \\nA. … Yeah, yeah, it’s different than that case, yeah.  \\nQ. Well, I’m just saying, I guess, the opinion that he’s - hasn’t responded to \\ntreatment in the past is – is a little bit coloured I would say. And – and it’s not \\nas clear cut as a – as a lot of offenders, I – I would say.  \\nA. Okay, I’ll say that, sure.” \\n(Emphasis added) \\nConclusion \\n[284]  \\nDr. Gray’s psychiatric opinion is that the evidence indicates intractability.  His \\nopinion is that it is highly unlikely that Mr. Hamelin will develop the necessary internal controls \\nwith time and treatment for him to manage his offending behaviours.  His opinion is that Mr. \\nHamelin poses a high risk to reoffend. \\n[285]  \\nDr. Gray identified the external controls necessary to manage Mr. Hamelin’s risk \\nbut identified no timeframe, and no prediction as to degree of success which could or would be \\nachieved.   \\n[286]  \\nAs Justice Molloy stated in Medford, \\n(at this stage) … I must consider whether I am satisfied that one of the other 2 \\noptions will protect the public.  If I am not satisfied, I am required to impose an \\nindeterminate sentence.  Further, if I am uncertain whether the public would be \\nsatisfied, I must refuse to exercise my discretion to impose a lesser sentence. \\n(para. 113) \\n[287]  \\nThe court in Boutilier stated the same principle, \\nSection 753(4.1) resolves “any uncertainty about the offender\\'s amenability to \\ntreatment in favour of indeterminate detention.” (para.119) \\n[288]  \\nAlthough further risk management therapies, programs, treatments, residency and \\nsupervision are available, I am left with uncertainty in Mr. Hamelin’s case about whether any risk \\nmanagement will be achieved, or when. \\n[289]  \\nAs stated in Boutilier,  \\n“If there is not a reasonable expectation that the public will be adequately \\nprotected against the commission of another serious personal injury offence, \\nindeterminate detention must be imposed.”  (para. 113) \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 64 \\n \\n \\n[290]  \\nConsidering all of the evidence and the applicable legal principles, I have no \\nreasonable expectation that a lesser penalty will adequately protect the public against him \\ncommitting a serious personal injury offence. \\n[291]  \\nAt its highest, the defence position of a 3 year determinate sentence followed by a \\n7 to 10 year LTSO, with the High Intensity ICPM within a penitentiary and the other treatment \\ntherapy recommended, LTSO with very strict and restrictive conditions, with the uncertainty of \\nhow long the necessary residency condition and close supervision such as Mr. Hebert will remain \\nin place, gives rise to only a hope that his risk of harm will be reduced.   \\n[292]  \\nThe mere hope of a good outcome is not sufficient. \\n[293]  \\nSuch speculation does not amount to reasonable expectation. \\n[294]  \\nFor these reasons, I find Mr. Hamelin to be a dangerous offender and I impose an \\nindeterminate sentence of imprisonment for the 3 convictions of criminal harassment, concurrent \\nto each other.  The sentences for the remaining counts are concurrent to those sentences and each \\nto each other: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 2 counts publish a defamatory libel:  2 years each; \\n\\uf0b7 Threat to burn home:  1 year; \\n\\uf0b7 Mischief:  1 year; \\n\\uf0b7 Possession stolen property:  1 year; \\n\\uf0b7 2 counts breach court orders:  20 months each. \\nAncillary Orders \\n[295]  \\nThe ancillary orders sought by the Crown are granted. \\n\\uf0b7 DNA - secondary \\n\\uf0b7 S. 109 – life \\n\\uf0b7 Non-communication with HN - 743.21 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTranmer J. \\n \\n \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nReleased:  March 26, 2024 \\n2024 ONSC 1280 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\nCITATION: R. v.

NAKATSURU \\n \\n[1] \\nOn June 15, 2021, a police surveillance team tried to box in a Nissan Rogue while it was \\nparked in a strip plaza on Jane Street in the city of Toronto. They were going to arrest its driver, \\nthe defendant, Mr. Damen Smith, along with the other occupants1 which included a Shamal \\nSearchwell-Beals whom the police believed to be the supplier of drugs for Mr. Smith. Mr. \\nSearchwell-Beals had just gotten into the rear seat of the Rogue from an adjacent Hyundai when \\nunmarked police cars moved in quickly to contain the Rogue. Mr. Smith accelerated and \\ndramatically reversed over a low embankment. The Rogue landed on Jane Street, busy with traffic \\nat 6:30 p.m. on that summer evening. Three police cars followed the Rogue over the embankment. \\nOne deliberately struck the Rogue’s front. Another intentionally struck its rear on the passenger \\nside. As Detective Balint tried to maneuver his car to block the driver’s side, Mr. Smith got out \\nand fled down the roadway toward the parking lot of another plaza. A foot chase ensued. It ended \\nwith Mr. Smith being struck by Detective Balint’s vehicle in the parking lot. When Mr. Smith got \\n                                                 \\n \\n1 Mr. Smith was in the driver’s seat. Ms. Raven Forde was in the front passenger seat. Mr. Searchwell-Beals was in \\nthe back passenger side seat. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 2 \\n \\n \\nto his feet again, Detective Balint placed him under arrest for drug offences that Project Red Owl \\ninvestigators believed he had been involved in based upon wiretap intercepts.  \\n[2] \\nAfter his arrest, search warrants for the Rogue and the address of unit 201, 10 Allenhurst \\nDrive, Toronto, were executed. Drugs, a gun, and other evidence were seized. Additional charges \\nwere laid against Mr. Smith. \\n[3] \\nThe charges Mr. Smith faces at his trial can be broken down into three categories: \\n\\uf0b7 \\ntrafficking in various illegal drugs from May 8 to June 15, 2021;2 \\n\\uf0b7 \\npossession of a firearm, proceeds, and drug offences resulting from the June 15, \\n2021, search of the Rogue;3and \\n\\uf0b7 \\ndrug and proceeds offences resulting from the June 15, 2021, search of unit 201, 10 \\nAllenhurst Drive.4 \\n[4] \\nBefore analyzing the evidence, I emphasize that any propensity reasoning is steadfastly \\nrejected. No cross-count similar act application was brought. The evidence led by the Crown must \\nbe assessed appropriately: R. v. Baksh, 2022 ONCA 481, at paras. 18-28. Provided propensity \\nreasoning is eschewed, evidence relating to one count can be circumstantial evidence to prove \\nanother count depending on the fact-specific circumstances: R. v. Jahangiri, 2022 ONCA 644, at \\nparas. 36-38. \\n[5] \\nProving the charges depends significantly upon circumstantial evidence. Thus, for the \\nCrown to meet its burden, I must be satisfied that the accused’s guilt regarding the material count \\nis the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence or the absence of evidence. \\nThis means I must be satisfied that the circumstantial evidence, assessed logically and in totality, \\nin light of human experience, excludes any other reasonable alternative other than guilt. If there is \\na reasonable inference or conclusion other than guilt, the Crown will not have met its burden of \\nproving the case beyond a reasonable doubt: R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, \\nat para. 35. \\n                                                 \\n \\n2 Counts 2 to 5 charge the defendant with trafficking in cocaine, MDMA, oxycodone, and benzodiazepine. Count 1 \\ninvolving methamphetamine was withdrawn by the Crown. \\n3 Counts 6 and 7 deal with the firearm. Counts 8 to 13 include possession for the purpose of trafficking, \\nmethamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA, and oxycodone.  \\n4 Counts 14 to 16 charge possession for the purpose of trafficking of MDMA and benzodiazepine as well proceeds of \\ncrime under $5000. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 3 \\n \\n \\nA. Trafficking in various illegal drugs from May 8 to June 15, 2021 \\n[6] \\nProof of these charges depends upon the authorized intercepts of private communication.  \\n[7] \\nThe defence concedes the phone found under the Rogue on the roadway after the \\ninteraction with the police was the phone used in the intercepts and that it belonged to the defendant \\nwho is identified in the transcripts to be Damen Smith. Of course, the intercepts and not the \\ntranscripts are the evidence. \\n[8] \\nIn addition, the Crown relies upon expert police officer reports about certain terms and \\nlanguage used in the calls. The defence admitted them without having to hear from the officers. \\nThough admitted into evidence in this way, this expert evidence will be assessed by me just like \\nany other witness. In other words, none, part, or all of that evidence can be accepted.  \\n[9] \\nAt final submissions, the defence advised that Mr. Smith wished to change his plea to that \\nof guilty on these counts. All agreed that the most efficient manner was to simply enter findings \\nof guilt on these counts. The Crown has proven all the essential elements beyond a reasonable \\ndoubt. I have listened carefully to the intercepts and scrutinized the texts. Of the 183 interceptions \\nof private communications spanning the period May 6 to June 15, 2021, the vast majority reveal a \\nconsistent pattern of retail drug trafficking by Mr. Smith. A purchaser contacting Mr. Smith. A \\nrequest for one drug or another. An agreement to sell. An arrangement for a meet. There can be no \\ndoubt whatsoever Mr. Smith was trafficking in the various drugs.  \\n[10] \\nWithout hesitation, I find there is no alternative interpretation of these intercepts. The \\ncontent including references to such things as the weights of the substances (often using drug slang \\nlike “half-ball”) as well as the pricing, the brief nature of the conversations, the mutual \\nunderstanding of what is being transacted, the meetings set up, complaints and compliments of the \\nproduct and the existence of repeat customers all support this finding. \\n[11] \\nFurthermore, what is being discussed are drugs; a finding supported by the lexicon filed in \\nthe drug expert report of D.C. Asner. For example, “sizzy”, “molly”, “percs”, “Xanies”, “soft”, \\nand “white”. Indeed, in a few intercepts, people use the words “cocaine”, “Xanax”, and “MDMA”.5 \\n[12] \\nThere will be findings of guilt on these counts. \\n                                                 \\n \\n5 Exhibit 26 (Includes audio and transcripts), tabs 13, 24, 95, 132. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 4 \\n \\n \\nB. The offences resulting from the June 15, 2021, search of the Rogue \\n1. The possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking and the proceeds of crime \\ncounts \\n[13] \\nThe takedown of the Rogue happened at 6:28 p.m. The search of the Rogue at the scene \\nrevealed numerous drugs in different locations of the vehicle as well as a firearm, scales, and \\nphones. The Crown relies upon constructive possession and/or joint possession of the various \\ndrugs pursuant to s. 4(3)(a)(ii) and s. 4(3)(b) of the Criminal Code. Where the accused does not \\nhave physical custody of the object in question, but has it in any place, for the use or benefit of \\nthemselves, this amounts to constructive possession. To prove this, the accused must have \\nknowledge of the character of the object, knowingly put or kept the object in a particular place, \\nwhether that place belongs to them, and intends to have the object in that place for their use or \\nbenefit: R. v. Morelli, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253, at para. 17. \\n[14] \\nOne essential element is proof of knowledge. In this case, several items of evidence prove \\nknowledge. \\n[15] \\nThe intercepts on June 15, revealing Mr. Smith arranging drug deals with unknown \\npersons6 are evidence that at a time close to the finding of the drugs by the police, he was engaged \\nin drug dealing in his vehicle. This contemporaneous circumstantial evidence supports the factual \\nfinding that the drugs in the car were Mr. Smith’s. The probative value of the intercepts on this \\nissue does not depend upon propensity reasoning, but from the fact that he would have needed a \\nsupply of drugs for his customers on the day in question: Jahangiri, at para. 4.  \\n[16] \\nThe circumstances in which the drugs were found also support Mr. Smith’s knowledge of \\ntheir presence. D.C. Morgan found some drugs in plain sight in the driver’s side door. Within easy \\nreach for a driver to traffick from the car. The officer also found a men’s care bag on the front \\npassenger side floor with various drugs inside. D.C. Doyle found two small bags with crack \\ncocaine on the passenger seat. While I appreciate that Ms. Raven Forde was sitting in the front \\npassenger seat, the proximity of these drugs to the driver along with the above intercepts are strong \\nevidence of Mr. Smith’s knowledge of the various drugs. \\n[17] \\nIn addition, underneath the driver’s seat were two digital scales, which is consistent with \\nMr. Smith trafficking drugs from his car.  \\n                                                 \\n \\n6 Exhibit 26, tabs 169, 170, 172-178, 180. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 5 \\n \\n \\n[18] \\nMore contentious is about a kilogram of methamphetamine located in a closed box in the \\ndriver’s side rear footwell. Also, a bag with a couple pounds of marijuana was found on the rear \\npassenger side floor. This was where Mr. Searchwell-Beals was sitting. \\n[19] \\nHere, the intercepts between Mr. Smith and Mr. Searchwell-Beals in and around June 15 \\nare significant. I note that there is no specific evidence of the voice identification of Mr. \\nSearchwell-Beals in the conversations denoted in the transcripts. Further, no admission was made \\nin that regard. However, the defence does not argue that the person Mr. Smith was speaking to was \\nanyone other than Mr. Searchwell-Beals. A reasonable inference can be drawn from the timing \\nand the content of the calls made on June 15, that the person who showed up at the plaza was the \\nperson on the calls.  \\n[20] \\nTo appreciate the full significance of these calls, I will conduct a detailed analysis of them. \\n[21] \\nTo set the context, several calls prior to June 15 between Mr. Smith and Mr. Searchwell-\\nBeals, while not conclusive, support the Crown theory that Mr. Searchwell-Beals is a drug supplier \\nof Mr. Smith’s.7  \\n[22] \\nCloser in time to June 15, there is a call between the two men that set further important \\ncontext to the calls intercepted on June 15. On June 13,8 Mr. Smith asks Mr. Searchwell-Beals if \\nhe had gotten through. The latter replies no, that it was supposed to come tonight, but he would \\n                                                 \\n \\n7 Exhibit 26, tab 17 May 9, 2021, Mr. Smith asks for a price for a “full one” but Mr. Searchwell-Beals does not have \\nany but is expecting some soon; tab 18 May 9, 2021, Mr. Smith asks for “two zaps” (ounces according to the lexicon. \\nThe notation in the brackets in this footnote will henceforth be a reference to the lexicon). Mr. Searchwell-Beals says \\nhe can do that, but he did not want complaints. Mr. Smith explains he was going to send it out of town so as long as \\nit “looks proper” it was okay. Mr. Searchwell-Beals assures him it is not “hard” (crack) and that he would give him \\nthe “tag” (price) for it; tab 19 May 9, 2021, the two men arrange a meeting and Mr. Searchwell-Beals says he is just \\ngoing to “ski” (weigh) it now; tab 57 May 20, 2021, Mr. Searchwell-Beals tells Mr. Smith that he only has what he \\ntold him but Mr. Smith is still looking and asks “not even like a cubes or beezle(ph)?” They arrange to meet later; tab \\n58 May 20, 2021, Mr. Smith says he is outside Mr. Searchwell-Beal’s “crib” and the latter tells Mr. Smith to come \\nup; tab 60 May 20, 2021, Mr. Smith tells Mr. Searchwell-Beals that he super needs that “thing” as he has “two fucking \\nhalf bounce whops” (half ounce drug deals) and a kid who buys daily grams, including “f” and “sizz”(fentanyl on \\nburning on foil or cocaine). Mr. Searchwell-Beals says he has to buy a “full” and can’t buy a “half” but that he will \\nlook around; tab 85 May 27, 2021, Mr. Smith asks if Mr. Searchwell-Beals still had that “thing” that he got for “sixty-\\nfive” as Mr. Smith needed a “four and a half” and asks the price to which Mr. Searchwell-Beals replies he may need \\nthe “full-as” and he does not want to “break him down” but he believed his boy might although he can’t; tab 86 May \\n27, 2021, Mr. Searchwell-Beals tells Mr. Smith he could ask a person for what Mr. Smith wanted but he was just \\nwaiting as no one was replying that day; tab 112 June 3, 2021, Mr. Searchwell-Beals tells Mr. Smith he has the “same \\nthing” and they arrange to meet up and when asked what he should have on him, Mr. Smith advises “nine seven”, asks \\nif it is “proper” and when told it is, agrees to it; tab 114 June 3, 2021, Mr. Smith tells Mr. Searchwell-Beals he has \\nbeen delayed due to getting something done on his boy’s “whip”(car) and they arrange to meet in about an hour. \\n8 Exhibit 26, tab 159. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 6 \\n \\n \\nnot get it until tomorrow. Mr. Smith asks what the “tags” or price would be. Mr. Searchwell-Beals \\nreplies he was not sure but in the “lows” and asks Mr. Smith what “tags” he was hearing, “nine \\nseven, nine five?” Mr. Smith says no he was saying for the “full thing”. Mr. Searchwell-Beals \\nsays, “what, like around, like thirty, thirty-eight still?” Mr. Smith replies yeah, “the same thing \\nyou showed me”. Mr. Searchwell-Beals says he could definitely beat that and “should be able to \\nsell it for at least like maybe thirty-seven, maybe lower.” Mr. Smith says “perfect” and to call him \\ntomorrow as soon as it was in because he owed his boy something as he had borrowed something \\nfrom him. Mr. Searchwell-Beals agrees. The Crown submits that the men were talking about a \\nkilogram of cocaine because of the price discussed. The drug expert, D.C. Asner’s opinion is that \\na kilogram of cocaine at the time was selling for $36,000 to $55,000. \\n[23] \\nThere are relevant calls between Mr. Smith and others on June 14. In two calls that day,9 \\nMr. Smith speaks with a “Jackson”. In the first call, Mr. Smith asks Jackson if he still wanted that \\n“thing”. When told yes, Mr. Smith said “okay” and that since the “last one is super proper” he was \\ngoing to tell him that Jackson gets the same thing, “no complications”. Jackson asks if it gets \\ncheaper to let him know. Mr. Smith replies he was going to “link” him now to see what he has to \\nsay. Jackson asks to let him know as he did not have too much. In a second call shortly after, Mr. \\nSmith tells Jackson that he is still waiting to get them for “sicker tags”, it’s a bit better than before, \\nand he would “shed five bills”. Jackson says he will be back tomorrow for it. In a third call to an \\nunknown male later that day, the unknown male asks Mr. Smith if he got through and Mr. Smith \\nreplies he is still waiting on “a lot of shit”. Mr. Smith says he is waiting for “a bird molly (MDMA), \\na bird tina (methamphetamine), and normal bird”10. According to D.C. Asner, a “bird” is a term \\nused for a kilogram. Later in the call, he says he is trying to break down “some of these P’s (points \\nof fentanyl) but he was trying to get those “birds”. The unknown male then says to link him when \\nMr. Smith’s boy gets back to him. \\n[24] \\nThese calls are significant as they show that the day before June 15, Mr. Smith is waiting \\nfor large quantities of different kinds of drugs. They set the scene for the later calls with Mr. \\nSearchwell-Beals. \\n[25] \\nAfter these calls, on June 14 as well,11 Mr. Smith calls Mr. Searchwell-Beals and asks him \\nsomething partially unintelligible. In other words, I cannot make it out. Mr. Searchwell-Beals \\nreplies “tomorrow afternoon times”. Mr. Smith acknowledges that and then asks, “what about the \\n                                                 \\n \\n9 Exhibit 26, tabs 161, 162. \\n10 The transcripts reads “Bird Marley, Bird Pena, and Normal Bird”. Having closely listened to the intercept, the \\ntranscript is wrong. I clearly hear “bird molly, bird tina, and normal bird.” Using D.C. Asner’s lexicon and the context \\nof the calls, I find “molly” and “tina” to mean MDMA and methamphetamine. The lexicon does not refer to “normal” \\nand I make no finding. The lexicon refers to “bird” as a kilogram. \\n11 Exhibit 26, tab 168. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 7 \\n \\n \\nnext thing?” Mr. Searchwell-Beals says nothing yet. He then says nothing tonight, so tomorrow \\nand he is just waiting. Then a phone rings right, and Mr. Searchwell-Beals says he hopes that is \\ngood news. Mr. Smith inquires whether he was going to get it right now. Mr. Searchwell-Beals \\nstates he doubted it and that it will be tomorrow. Mr. Smith says let him know and that he’ll “take \\nsomething for sure.” \\n[26] \\nThese calls set up the pivotal events on June 15.  \\n[27] \\nOn June 15, at 14:4112, Mr. Smith asks Mr. Searchwell-Beals where the latter was. Mr. \\nSearchwell-Beals says he would be back at Weston or Walmart in ten minutes. Mr. Smith says he \\nwas at the “G-station by my crib”. Mr. Searchwell-Beals suggests meeting in six minutes. Mr. \\nSmith agrees but says he still has to “count the things quick”. Mr. Searchwell-Beals apologizes \\nand says this guy could only meet at that time. Then Mr. Smith inquires how long Mr. Searchwell-\\nBeals would be at the gym. An hour was the reply. Then, Mr. Smith says that he will check Mr. \\nSearchwell-Beals after the gym as Mr. Smith was probably going to eat and he had to “count some \\nfiles, you know.” D.C. Asner’s lexicon interprets “files” as money. The two men agree to be in \\ncontact when Mr. Searchwell-Beals is done at the gym. \\n[28] \\nAt 17:05,13 Mr. Searchwell-Beals calls Mr. Smith and says he was trying to call Mr. Smith \\nbut it was going to voice mail. Mr. Smith apologizes and says he is just up north, and that he would \\ncall when he gets back “to the ends”.  \\n[29] \\nAt 17:50,14 Mr. Smith calls Mr. Searchwell-Beals to say he is just driving back “to the \\nends” and asks Mr. Searchwell-Beals if he wants to “link up quick.” Mr. Searchwell-Beals says he \\njust got home and was about to eat. Mr. Smith says he will be back in 20 minutes, and they agree \\nthat Mr. Smith was going to call then. Mr. Searchwell-Beals says he will shower and wait for him.  \\n[30] \\nAt 18:04,15 Mr. Smith calls Mr. Searchwell-Beals and asks the latter if he wants to “meet \\nat Mac’s in ten?” Mr. Searchwell-Beals agrees and Mr. Smith assures him that he will be there “in \\nlegit ten.” \\n                                                 \\n \\n12 Exhibit 26, tab 171. \\n13 Exhibit 26, tab 179. \\n14 Exhibit 26, tab 181. \\n15 Exhibit 26, tab 182. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 8 \\n \\n \\n[31] \\nAt 18:17,16 Mr. Searchwell-Beals calls Mr. Smith and Mr. Searchwell-Beals says he has \\n“to scale something. I’m leaving now”. D.C. Asner’s lexicon interprets “scale” to mean “weigh \\nscale”. As a matter of common sense, “scale” as used in this call likely means to mean weigh \\nsomething. Mr. Smith answers it’s all good and he had just pulled up.  \\n[32] \\nIn summary, when I assess these calls on June 15 in the context of the previous calls, I am \\nsure that Mr. Smith and Mr. Searchwell-Beals are planning to meet at the Mac’s convenience store \\nfor a drug deal. The fact that the police observe Mr. Smith entering the plaza where a Mac’s \\nconvenience store is located at a time proximate to when Mr. Smith says he is just pulling up, \\nsupports this. The fact that Mr. Searchwell-Beals then attends the same plaza, just as he says he \\nwill in the call, supports this. The fact that the methamphetamine was found in the back cabin area \\nof the Rogue supports the meet was for a drug transaction. Indeed, the call on June 14 with an \\nunknown male indicates that Mr. Smith was in fact waiting for a kilogram of methamphetamine. \\nIn addition, a kid’s backpack with over $25,000 in cash was found on the floor of the driver’s side. \\nWhen I analyze the charge of possession of the proceeds of crime below, I explain why I find this \\nto be Mr. Smith’s cash. The obvious question to be asked is why Mr. Smith, who generally is a \\nretail level seller of drugs, would have that significant quantity of cash in his car? The answer is \\nto purchase a significant quantity of illegal drugs. In R. v. Duvivier, 2010 ONCA 136, at para. 8, \\nwhere money was seized from the accused at the time of his arrest, the court observed that the \\npresence of money was one piece of circumstantial evidence available for consideration as pointing \\nto knowledge and control of the drugs. \\n[33] \\nIn my opinion, the whole of the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. \\nSearchwell-Beals brought the methamphetamine to sell to Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith was waiting in \\nthe Rogue to purchase the methamphetamine. There is no other reasonable inference to be drawn \\nfrom the totality of the evidence. \\n[34] \\nWhen I look at other evidence or the absence of evidence, it does not dissuade me from \\nthis conclusion. True, no police officer observed Mr. Searchwell-Beals bring anything from the \\nHyundai into the Rogue. However, the police were not able to see Mr. Searchwell-Beal’s entire \\nbody. D.C. Miles, who had the best vantage point when this occurred, could not see Mr. \\nSearchwell-Beal’s arms, as his line of view was partially blocked by the Hyundai that Mr. \\nSearchwell-Beal exited from. \\n[35] \\nThe possibility that Mr. Smith and Mr. Searchwell-Beals were speaking of cocaine earlier, \\non June 13, does not impede my finding that Mr. Searchwell-Beals brought the methamphetamine. \\nIt was clear that there was some difficulty with Mr. Searchwell-Beal’s own supplier. Moreover, \\non June 14, Mr. Smith asks Mr. Searchwell-Beals about the “other thing”. The “other thing”, it \\n                                                 \\n \\n16 Exhibit 26, tab 183. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 9 \\n \\n \\nturns out, was methamphetamine. The call with the unknown male on June 14 reveals Mr. Smith \\nwas waiting for a kilogram of that specific drug. \\n[36] \\nThat the amount of money brought by Mr. Smith is greater than what D.C. Asner opined \\nthe cost of a kilogram of methamphetamine was in 2021 also does not make me question my \\nfinding. First, the amount is not that far off. D.C. Asner opined a kilogram of methamphetamine \\nwas $16,000 to $20,000. Also, it is worth mentioning two lbs. of marijuana was found in the back \\nseat area which if Mr. Smith was also buying would have added to the overall cost of the \\ntransaction.  \\n[37] \\nThere is then Mr. Smith’s flight from the scene. I expand upon this later in my reasons \\nwhen it comes to the firearm counts. For the moment, I will say that while there might be some \\nalternative explanations for the flight, this “after-the-fact” conduct while by no means \\ndeterminative, tends to support Mr. Smith’s knowledge of the various drugs in the car.  \\n[38] \\nWhen the whole of the evidence is considered, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt \\nthat the methamphetamine was brought into the car by Mr. Searchwell-Beals and that Mr. Smith \\nknew that. Bluntly, Mr. Smith did not allow a kilogram of methamphetamine to be brought into \\nhis car without his knowing about it.17 \\n[39] \\nMoving on from knowledge, I find control of the various drugs to be proven beyond a \\nreasonable doubt. Though this was a rental car, Mr. Smith was seen by surveillance officers driving \\nthe car before on previous dates. On June 15, he was the driver. He exercised control over the car \\nand its contents including the drugs. Other than the methamphetamine in the box, I further find \\nthat those drugs belonged to Mr. Smith and he exercised control through ownership. Regarding \\nthe methamphetamine, the evidence does not establish clearly that the transaction had taken place \\nand that Mr. Smith obtained the methamphetamine from Mr. Searchwell-Beals. However, given \\nmy conclusion from the intercepts and the fact that Mr. Smith permitted Mr. Searchwell-Beals to \\nenter the vehicle for the purpose of this transaction, he exercised control over the \\nmethamphetamine: R. v. Chambers (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 440 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Terrence, [1983] \\n1 S.C.R. 357. The methamphetamine was in the backseat of the Rogue for Mr. Smith and Mr. \\nSearchwell-Beals’ use and benefit to complete the transaction. While Mr. Smith had an interest in \\nthe drugs as well, the most salient fact is that by being in control of the vehicle, he had control \\nover who could enter it and under what circumstances. He had the power to give consent or to \\nwithhold consent to Mr. Searchwell-Beals’ entering the vehicle knowing the latter was bringing \\n                                                 \\n \\n17 I observe that even if one assumes Mr. Searchwell-Beals did not bring the box of methamphetamine with him, the \\nonly other reasonable alternative conclusion on the evidence is that it was Mr. Smith himself who owned the \\nmethamphetamine and had knowledge and control over it.  Either way, he is guilty of the charge. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 10 \\n \\n \\nthe methamphetamine for the transaction. Mr. Smith chose to give his consent because he wanted \\nto purchase the methamphetamine. Thus, I am sure he exercised sufficient control. \\n[40] \\nThe defence argued that it was a reasonable alternative that Mr. Smith did not have \\npossession of the drugs as there were two other occupants in the vehicle. I find the fact that Ms. \\nForde and Mr. Searchwell-Beals were in the car does not afford a reasonable inference that Mr. \\nSmith did not have knowing possession of these drugs. On the evidence, it is an entirely \\nunreasonable inference that Mr. Smith did not know about the drugs and did not exercise control \\nover them.  \\n[41] \\nThe defence made no submissions regarding whether the possession was for the purpose \\nof trafficking. Rightfully so. Given the intercepts of June 15, the circumstances in which the drugs \\nwere found, and the opinion of the drug expert, D.C. Asner, the Crown has proven this essential \\nelement beyond a reasonable doubt. \\n[42] \\nThere will be findings of guilt on counts 8 to 12. \\n[43] \\nIn a child’s “Shark” backpack lying in the footwell of the driver’s seat was $25,455. I am \\nsatisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown has proven all the essential elements of the \\noffence of possession of proceeds of crime. Based on the intercepts alluded to above, the finding \\nthat Mr. Smith was at the material time a drug trafficker, and the monies were to be used to \\npurchase drugs from Mr. Searchwell-Beals, I find that this sum of money was derived directly \\nfrom Mr. Smith’s drug trafficking. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the money was \\nMr. Smith’s, he knew of its illicit origin as he was the one who gained it by trafficking in drugs, \\nand he had brought it to the meeting to purchase drugs. This is based on the whole of the evidence \\nincluding the intercepts, (especially the intercept where he says he must “count the files”), the \\nlarge amount of cash brought to the scene, and the nature of the backpack used to carry it (clearly \\nso as to not raise suspicion). I find there to be no other rational inference to be drawn from the \\nevidence except that Mr. Smith possessed monies of a value exceeding five thousand dollars, \\nknowing that all or part of that property had been derived directly or indirectly from an offence \\npunishable by indictment contrary to s. 354(1) of the Criminal Code.  \\n[44] \\nTherefore, Mr. Smith is found guilty of count 13. \\n2. Possession of the firearm counts \\n[45] \\nAfter the police disabled the Rogue on Jane Street, D.C. Miles dealt with the front seat \\npassenger, Ms. Forde, while D.C. Doyle dealt with Mr. Searchwell-Beals. Both were detained. \\nD.C. Miles had Ms. Forde step over the driver’s seat to extricate herself from the car since her \\npassenger side door was blocked by one of the police cars. Her foot hit a black satchel on the \\ndriver’s seat. To D.C. Miles, it seemed to contain something heavy. After handing Ms. Forde off \\nto another officer, he returned to the car, unzipped the satchel, and saw a firearm within it. The \\nCrown submits that it was Mr. Smith’s firearm. Proof of its possession depends upon \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 11 \\n \\n \\ncircumstantial evidence. Thus, the cumulative effect of all of the evidence must be considered \\nincluding weak evidence: R. v. Lights, 2020 ONCA 128, 149 O.R. (3d) 273, at para. 37.  \\n[46] \\nThe following is my analysis of that evidence. \\n[47] \\nDetective Balint testified that at 8:40 p.m. on June 14, 2021, at 10 Allenhurst Drive, he saw \\nMr. Smith walk to that address with a black satchel slung across his shoulder. It was not as big as \\na knapsack but bigger than a fanny pack. In cross, he admitted that the satchel had no distinctive \\nfeatures. Based on the photos of the satchel that had the firearm, it does not appear to me that Mr. \\nSmith was carrying that satchel on June 14 since the satchel with the firearm had a very distinctive \\nbright red stripe on the shoulder strap. It is hard to miss. It appears to be a designer satchel. In \\naddition, I am mindful that black or dark colored side satchels are not that rare these days. This, \\ncoupled with the lack of a red striped strap on the bag that was seen on June 14, gives this evidence \\nof Detective Balint little weight in supporting the inference that the satchel with the firearm was \\nMr. Smith’s. Of course though, I will consider it in the overall proof by the Crown. \\n[48] \\nMore significantly, on June 15, Detective Balint observed Mr. Smith exit 10 Allenhurst \\nDrive with a female at 2:15 p.m. and get into the Rogue. He also took a short video of Mr. Smith. \\nThe video does not show Mr. Smith with a satchel. Detective Balint testified under cross that he \\nhad a decent chance to see Mr. Smith, longer than the short video, and agreed he did not see Mr. \\nSmith with anything in his hand or with a black satchel. Thus, there is no direct evidence of Mr. \\nSmith carrying the black satchel that day though I appreciate it could have already been in the car \\nor he could have picked up elsewhere when he was not observed by the police. \\n[49] \\nThe Crown relies on two intercepts to support proof the firearm was Mr. Smith’s. The first \\none on May 21, 2021, between Mr. Smith and an ex-girlfriend, “Riza”, does not advance that \\nproof. In that call, Riza is upset at Mr. Smith’s friend, “Smallz”, and counsels Mr. Smith that this \\nperson was not a real friend and could not be trusted. Mr. Smith is not worried and the two talk \\nabout Smallz. During that discussion, Mr. Smith briefly mentions that if the “little kid” tried \\nanything, he would “bust his head” as Smallz doesn’t even have a “strap”. Expert firearm opinion \\nis that a “strap” can mean a gun. That acknowledged, in my view, even assuming “strap” meant a \\ngun in this conversation, this comment says nothing about Mr. Smith having a gun.  \\n[50] \\nThe second intercept relied upon by the Crown happened on May 30, 2021, between Mr. \\nSmith and someone identified to be “Kamara”. The Crown submits the two men are having a \\nconversation about a firearm magazine and ammunition for a firearm. I have listened to this call \\nnumerous times and have considered it in the context of the evidence as a whole. I am unable to \\nconclude the men are talking about a firearm, ammunition, or a clip for the following reasons. First \\nof all, nothing like that is alluded to in the call except perhaps when Kamara at the beginning of \\nthe call laughs and without any context, says he can’t picture Mr. Smith with a “thirty” because \\nMr. Smith is too militant, and he does not really need the “extra shots”. Mr. Smith says he does \\nnot need the extra “shit” and he would take an extra “kleezy”. The Crown argues “kleezy” means \\na clip or a magazine. However, D.C. Ivkovic, the expert on coded/slang language for firearms \\nmakes no reference to “kleezy”. Kamara then says a man’s trying to sell him a “thirty boppers”. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 12 \\n \\n \\nThe Crown argues that this is a thirty-round magazine for a firearm of the sort found in the vehicle. \\nHowever, again D.C. Ivkovic gives no opinion on this language. Moreover, Mathew Passmore, \\nthe Senior Firearms Officer, provided opinion evidence that while thirty-round magazines are \\ngenerally available for use in semi-automatic firearms from third party suppliers, for the model of \\nfirearm seized from the car such a thirty-round magazine was not commonly available on the open \\nmarket in Canada nor the United States. Mr. Smith and Kamara then talk about pricing but it is \\nunclear from the pricing what they are discussing. Given the numerous other calls related to drug \\ntrafficking, it is an available reasonable inference that they are discussing something drug related. \\nFinally, even if they were talking about ammunition and something firearm related, as I see the \\ncall, a plausible interpretation is that Kamara had a firearm but not necessarily Mr. Smith. While I \\nwill still consider this evidence in the overall assessment of the circumstantial case against Mr. \\nSmith, I do not find this call to be as inculpatory as the Crown argues.  \\n[51] \\nThe fact that the satchel was on the driver’s seat along with Mr. Smith’s car keys is good \\nevidence supporting the inference the satchel containing the firearm belonged to Mr. Smith. On \\nthe other hand, other occupants of the vehicle could easily have put the satchel there once Mr. \\nSmith left the vehicle. It would be a simple matter to toss the satchel onto the seat. I note that \\nneither Ms. Forde nor Mr. Searchwell-Beals were called to give evidence at this trial. \\n[52] \\nThere is the DNA evidence. The DNA expert testified that Mr. Smith could not be excluded \\nas the major contributor of the DNA found on the firearm. There was other person(s)’s DNA on \\nthe gun but not in enough quantity to create a profile. Given the improbability of a random match, \\nI find that Mr. Smith’s DNA was on the firearm.  \\n[53] \\nThe DNA evidence of Mr. Smith on the gun would normally be very strong evidence for \\nthe Crown. However, the gun was very poorly handled by the police prior to sending it for DNA \\nanalysis. The firearm was proven safe at the scene by D.C. Morgan. However, he also handled \\nnumerous drug exhibits from the car as well as items such as the key fob. He also handled the \\nsatchel which D.C. Miles first touched when he discovered the gun after touching parts of the \\nvehicle. D.C. Morgan could not recall if the satchel was closed after it was proven safe but he left \\nall the evidence together on the front seat of the car. All of this increased the chances of cross-\\ncontamination of Mr. Smith’s DNA with the gun. Even worse was the procedure back at 12 \\nDivision when the gun was taken out and laid out on a large cardboard box along with the other \\nitems seized including the drugs found in the car so they could be photographed. For example, \\nD.C. Manserra handled the exhibits before he touched the gun to prove it safe. Another example. \\nD.C. Tanel handled the exhibits before he removed the firearm from the satchel. Although the \\nofficers wore gloves, clearly by handling the objects in this way, the police could have \\ninadvertently cross-contaminated the gun with Mr. Smith’s DNA from another object. This is not \\nspeculation. It is a reasonable possibility. The DNA expert was unable to opine whether Mr. \\nSmith’s DNA was deposited there directly or through the mechanism of transference. This state of \\nthe evidence weakens the otherwise strong inference I could have drawn from Mr. Smith’s DNA \\non the firearm. Again, despite the problems in ensuring the proper handling of the gun, I will still \\nconsider this evidence when assessing the inference to be drawn from the cumulative effect of the \\nevidence.  \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 13 \\n \\n \\n[54] \\nMr. Smith’s flight from the scene is also good evidence. Evidence of \"after-the-fact\" \\nconduct can be circumstantial evidence of guilt including the accused’s level of culpability or \\nintent, but it must be approached with caution: R. v. Calnen, 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at \\npara. 25; R. v. White, 2011 SCC 13, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 23; R. v. Arcangioli, [1994] 1 \\nS.C.R. 129 at p. 143. It is well-established that before drawing an inference of guilt from post-\\noffence conduct, a trier of fact must consider alternate explanations for the conduct: White, at \\nparas. 23-34. In determining whether the evidence can be used for this purpose, the court should \\nconsider the specific nature of the conduct, its relationship to the record as a whole, and the issues \\nraised at trial: Calnen, at para. 119. \\n[55] \\nThe alternative explanations for his attempt to flee police containment both in the Rogue \\nand on foot, makes the drawing of the right inference complicated in this case. As noted above, \\nMr. Smith could equally have been fleeing from the drugs in the car that I find belonged to him. \\nMoreover, there is an intercepted call where Mr. Smith discusses how he gets a thrill out of fleeing \\nin a car from the police.18 He knows the police do not engage in dangerous high-speed chases and \\nhe views flight as a good option should the police ever seek to arrest him in a car. This extremely \\nirresponsible attitude must be rightfully condemned but it does add to the alternative explanations \\nfor his conduct. In other words, his flight both in the car and on foot could partly be explained by \\nthat attitude as opposed to any knowledge or control over the firearm in the satchel. In the end, \\nwhile this evidence is probative, it is not sufficiently fact-specific to the firearm in the satchel that \\nin the circumstances of this case, it much advances the circumstantial inference of guilt on the \\nfirearm charges. \\n[56] \\nLastly, Mr. Smith was not alone in the car. The defence argues that the gun could have \\nbelonged to one of the passengers without Mr. Smith knowing of it. I am not persuaded that the \\ngun and satchel belonging to Ms. Forde is a reasonable inference to be drawn given the lack of \\nevidence connecting her to the satchel, any drug-trafficking or a motive to have a firearm. \\nHowever, it is reasonably possible that Mr. Searchwell-Beals could have brought the satchel with \\nthe gun into the Rogue and have put the satchel onto the driver’s seat to distance himself from the \\nfirearm contained within without Mr. Smith’s knowledge. This is an inference that flows logically \\nfrom the evidence and is not conjecture nor speculation for the following reasons. \\n[57] \\nFirst, given the observation points of the officers conducting surveillance, no officer could \\nsay that when Mr. Searchwell-Beals exited the driver’s seat of the red Hyundai and entered the \\nbackseat of the Rogue, he was not carrying anything like the satchel in his hands. Indeed, I have \\nalready determined that he was at least carrying the box of methamphetamine. \\n[58] \\nSecond, Mr. Searchwell-Beals had the opportunity to place the satchel into the driver’s \\nseat. He knew the police were present. They had rushed the Rogue with guns drawn yelling \\n                                                 \\n \\n18 Exhibit 26, tab 93. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 14 \\n \\n \\n“police”. He had time to put the satchel there once Mr. Smith had exited the driver’s seat and had \\nrun off. Given the dynamic situation unfolding on Jane Street, no one could see what was \\nhappening inside the Rogue. \\n[59] \\nThird, Mr. Searchwell-Beals had a motive to bring a firearm to the scene. The Crown \\nargues that he did not, because he had a good relationship with Mr. Smith and therefore did not \\nfear that Mr. Smith would rob him or otherwise take advantage of him. However, it may not be \\nMr. Smith that Mr. Searchwell-Beals might have feared. Mr. Searchwell-Beals was bringing a \\nlarge quantity of methamphetamine to the meet. He was going to leave the meet with a large \\nquantity of cash. It makes common-sense that Mr. Searchwell-Beals may have feared others who \\nmight want to relieve him of either the drugs or the cash. In these circumstances, it is as logical \\nand consistent with human experience for Mr. Searchwell-Beals to arm himself with a firearm as \\nit was for Mr. Smith to do so. \\n[60] \\nFourth, the DNA evidence does not preclude Mr. Searchwell-Beals. There is a lessor \\nquantity of unknown DNA contributor(s) on the swabs taken from the firearm.  \\n[61] \\nUltimately, it is more likely than not that the gun was Mr. Smith’s. Looking at the evidence \\ncumulatively, including all the less probative evidence, it is an entirely reasonable inference based \\non the circumstantial evidence that the gun is Mr. Smith’s. Indeed, if Mr. Smith was alone in the \\ncar or even with just Ms. Forde, a finding of guilt would be inevitable. But the alternative inference, \\nthat it was Mr. Searchwell-Beal’s firearm brought into the vehicle without Mr. Smith’s knowledge \\nor consent remains a reasonable one that cannot be precluded based upon the whole of the \\nevidence. This includes the absence of evidence from the other occupants of the car. Perhaps in an \\noverly basic formulation, there were two drug traffickers in that car who could have had the gun. \\nI cannot be sure which one.  \\n[62] \\nMr. Smith is found not guilty of counts 6 and 7. \\nC. Drug and proceeds offences resulting from the June 15, 2021, search of unit 201, 10 \\nAllenhurst Drive \\n[63] \\nA search warrant was executed at what was believed to be Mr. Smith’s residence. In the \\ncloset of a bedroom, officers found:  \\n(a) \\nan opaque plastic shopping bag containing: \\na. \\na bag of benzodiazepine pills, weighing approximately 152 g, \\nb. \\na bag of benzodiazepine pills, weighing approximately 215 g, \\nc. \\na clear bag of MDMA, weighing 254g; and \\n(b) \\na small locked safe, containing: \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 15 \\n \\n \\na. \\n$800 CAD, \\nb. \\n$105 USD, and \\nc. \\n€50. \\n[64] \\nWhen the police arrived to execute the search warrant, they had the keys that was on the \\nkey chain with the fob to the Rogue. Inside the two-bedroom apartment, was someone who \\nidentified himself to the police as Mark Smith.  \\n[65] \\nTo be clear, I do not consider the evidence that Mr. Smith was a drug trafficker as evidence \\nthat the drugs in unit 201 were his. That would be propensity reasoning and no proper application \\nwas brought by the Crown to have that evidence admitted on these counts for that purpose: R. v. \\nLepage, [1995] 1 S.C.R 654, at paras. 37-38; Jahangiri, at paras. 38-42. Said differently, no cross-\\ncount similar fact application was brought by the Crown to make that evidence admissible for that \\npurpose. Unlike when I dealt with the possession of the drugs in the car, I do not consider the drug \\ntrafficking done on June 15 to be contemporaneous circumstantial evidence relating to the \\npossession of the drugs in unit 201, especially given Detective Balint did not see Mr. Smith carry \\nanything to the Rogue when he exited 10 Allenhurst Drive that day. \\n[66] \\nThat acknowledged, it is a reasonable inference that Mr. Smith possessed the drugs in unit \\n201 for the purpose of trafficking. He had the keys to the bedroom door and the safe inside the \\ncloset. Inside the closet on top of the safe, there were some documents in his name. Also, in a \\nshelving unit, there were more documents in his name. These included a health record and a tax \\nform.  \\n[67] \\nOn the other hand, it is a reasonable inference that the drugs were not Mr. Smith’s but Mark \\nSmith’s, who I have not heard from as a witness.19 The reasonable doubt comes from the following \\nevidence and absence of evidence. \\n[68] \\nMr. Smith was seen by police surveillance on three occasions leaving the apartment \\nbuilding at 10 Allenhurst Drive on June 10, 14, and 15. But there is little other evidence to establish \\nthis is his primary residence. The documents located in the bedroom, while carrying his name, \\nhave a Swansea Mews address on it. There are only two documents that I can clearly identify from \\nthe photographic evidence of the documents and they are a tax assessment from 2018 and health \\ntest results from 2019. No other identification or more current document featuring Mr. Smith’s \\nname or the address of 10 Allenhurst Drive was presented. As the defence submitted, the \\ndocuments, only in evidence as photographs, are of a nature that a son could store at a parent’s or \\n                                                 \\n \\n19 Some of the evidence that Mark Smith told the police led through the police witnesses is hearsay evidence and \\ncannot be considered for the truth of its content. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 16 \\n \\n \\na close relative’s home.20 And there does not seem to be many documents. Moreover, while Mr. \\nSmith’s keys opened the bedroom door and the safe, the evidence does not show he had keys to \\nthe front door of the apartment. While I appreciate that due to the need to enter the unit quickly, \\nDetective Parmar’s unsuccessful attempt to gain entry using Mr. Smith’s keys may have been due \\nto a lack of dexterity or an impatience to resort to the ram and not from the fact none of the various \\nkeys fit the front door lock, there is no excuse for an officer not trying the keys again on the front \\ndoor when things were calmer and under control. \\n[69] \\nA significant piece of evidence is the fact that Mark Smith was in the apartment at the time. \\nHe was arrested. D.C. Wocks testified that in the other bedroom, one scale, three envelopes of \\ncash, two baggies of cash, two empty packaging, and two bags of white powder of what was \\nbelieved to be cocaine was found.21 \\n[70] \\nMoreover, unusually, when the police burst through the door after battering it down until \\nit broke in two, Mark Smith was standing in the hallway with a set of keys in his hand. The door \\nto the bedroom in which the benzodiazepine and MDMA was later found was not locked but open. \\nThe police did not try the keys in Mark Smith’s hand to see what door or items they opened. As I \\nsaid, it is curious behaviour for someone inside an apartment in these circumstances to be walking \\naround with keys in his hand. \\n[71] \\nGiven this state of evidence, Mark Smith’s absence as a witness has some import. There is \\nno other admissible evidence, such as forensic evidence, tying the drugs in the closet to Mr. Smith. \\n[72] \\nWhile it is a reasonable inference that Mr. Smith had knowledge and control over the drugs \\nin the closet, it remains a reasonable inference that he did not. As the defence submits, Mark Smith \\nwould have had time to place those drugs there without Mr. Smith’s knowledge given how the \\npolice announced themselves at the door and took time to enter. Mark Smith would have a motive \\nto do that if he wanted to distance himself from those drugs. Mark Smith having keys in his hand \\nand the bedroom door being open support that theory.  \\n[73] \\nThis is a close call. Nonetheless, I find that the burden of proof has not been met by the \\nprosecution. \\n[74] \\nMr. Smith will be found not guilty of counts 14 and 15. \\n[75] \\n With respect to the last count, Detective Parmar testified that some of the bills in the safe \\nwere older bills and he could not say the currency was current. Only an unhelpful photograph of \\n                                                 \\n \\n20 That Mark Smith is Mr. Smith’s father was only hearsay evidence. \\n21 There is no evidence led that this in fact tested as cocaine. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\nPage: 17 \\n \\n \\nthe monies was produced. The total amount is not large. The monies were stored in a safe. There \\nwas nothing else in the safe. Finally, the American and European bills are unlikely to have come \\nfrom local street trafficking. The defence submits that even if Mr. Smith had knowledge and \\ncontrol, a safe bet given that he had the key to the locked safe, it remains a reasonable possibility \\nthat the bills were just placed there to merely collect them. While I can bet that was not the case, \\nnonetheless, on the whole of the evidence it is reasonably true these monies were not proceeds of \\ncrime. Therefore, I entertain a reasonable doubt and Mr. Smith is found not guilty of count 16. \\nD. Final disposition \\n[76] \\nMr. Smith is found guilty of counts 2 to 5 and 8 to 13. He is found not guilty of the \\nremaining counts. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nJUSTICE S. NAKATSURU \\n \\nReleased: March 26, 2024. \\n2024 ONSC 1482 (CanLII)\\n \\n \\n \\nCITATION: R. v.

I was also satisfied that Mr. Chelliah had proven most of his damages, but I was not convinced that the evidence tendered fully supported the total quantum claimed. I confirmed that I would be granting judgment on the counterclaim in an amount to be quantified and for reasons to follow. I needed additional time to review and consider the evidence on damages, which included expert evidence. Regrettably, my analysis took much longer to complete than I had anticipated. In addition, this decision has been unfortunately further delayed through no fault of the Owners due to unforeseen and unexpected circumstances significantly impacting my schedule. [6] For the reasons outlined below, I find that Mr. Chelliah has proven damages of $288,577.10, including HST, and is entitled to judgment against Galaxy for the same amount, plus pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Courts of Justice Act, RSO 1990, c C.43. I further fix costs of the action and coun\n",

            "been completed. Mr. Chelliah’s evidence is that the Owners have not had the ability to pay to fix the remaining issues. They went into debt to have Galaxy construct the house and have had to pay legal fees after Galaxy commenced litigation. I accept that evidence. [69] Galaxy has not appeared to put forward any argument on how the damages could have been mitigated in these circumstances or how Mr. Chelliah failed to take reasonable steps to do so. I thereby find that Mr. Chelliah’s damages could not have been mitigated, since the undisputed 2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII) evidence is that remedial and completion work could not have proceeded sooner by reason of the Owners’ financial circumstances. IV. PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST & COSTS [70] Mr. Chelliah seeks pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Courts of Justice Act from the date of the occupancy permit issuance on July 12, 2018. The Owners concede that they willingly waited for occupancy, but submit that they ought to have been able to take poss\n",

            "when his parents were put up in a motel. Mr. Chelliah’s undisputed evidence is that, at the material times, his parents lived with the Owners and their children. His mother has since passed away. Mr. Chelliah’s affidavit evidence is that his parents were unhappy in the basement of Mr. Kanagasabai’s house and, intermittently, he rented a motel for them to use at a rate of $560 per week. [63] The calculation of $1,650 is unclear. No evidence was given on the specific dates for which Mr. Chelliah’s parents stayed in the motel. Although they live with Mr. Chelliah and his family, 2024 ONSC 1947 (CanLII) there is no evidence that they are dependents of Mr. Chelliah nor is there evidence addressing whether they can or do financially contribute to the household. I have difficulty finding that motel costs for Mr. Chelliah’s parents are reasonably foreseeable damages flowing from Galaxy’s delayed performance of the construction. [64] In any event, Mr. Chelliah’s evidence is that the Owners did \n",
